Social and solidarity economy and access to food: Insights from Cameroon,['Nathanael Ojong'],"The social and solidarity economy has an increasingly important role in the issue of access to food. This article examines food solidarity in various low-income communities in Cameroon. In the foreground is a nuanced perspective on food distribution practices in the country; such practices allow the low-income population to have access to food. The methodology is qualitative; Interviews were conducted with the participants in English, French, and Pidgin. To facilitate the disclosure of information, it was clarified that the data provided will be anonymous (pseudonyms are used). In addition, for confidentiality reasons, no information that could reveal the identity of the participants is disclosed.",Article,1 , Revista Nacional de Administración,4d ago,0,"

Transnational Labour Solidarity as Transformative Practice: Reframing the Role of Labour Transnationalism,['Katherine Nastovski'],"In the 1980s and 1990s, a significant number of rank-and-file trade union activists in Canada became actively engaged in various forms of international labour solidarity. This activity, the end of the Cold War and the increasing impacts of neo-liberal globalisation combined to spark hopes for greatly expanding practices of labour transnationalism. This vision of transnationalising trade union organisation has not materialised and, in fact, inside Canadian unions there has been declining faith in the possibilities of building transnational solidarity. Starting with an analysis of the dominant dichotomies underlying the literature on labour transnationalism, I suggest that stepping outside these dichotomies can provide a different way of assessing the role of transnational labour solidarity within broader struggles for workers’ justice. In this article, drawing upon the case of transnational political solidarities built by workers inside Canadian unions in the 1980s and 1990s, I argue that assessing transnational practices with a longer view to class formation and the goals of workers’ emancipation can help to expand conceptions of what constitutes successful transnational practice. Such a reassessment of the role of labour transnationalism is particularly timely in the current context of right-wing populism.",Article,1 , Global Labour Journal,,0,"

Women's law‐making and contestations of “marriage” in African conflict situations,"['Annie Bunting', 'Heather Tasker', 'Emily Lockhart']","International criminal law has developed significantly over the past 20 years since the establishment of the ad hoc Tribunals and International Criminal Court. Much scholarly attention has focused on the politics and jurisprudence of these courts, with particular focus on the prosecution of sexual and gender‐based violence. This article adds to the literature with comparative, qualitative research with survivors of conflict‐related forced marriage in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Uganda, revealing context‐specific understandings of marriage, consent and harm. We argue women exercise “tactic agency” in captivity in ways that are, taken together, “law‐making” in their contestations over the socio‐legal categories of marriage. Their contestations of marriage impact the norms within rebel groups as well as the development of new crimes against humanity in international criminal law. Building on the empirical findings, we argue that prosecution of crimes against humanity and reparation programs ought to be flexible and responsive enough to capture the varied experiences of women and girls abducted in war for purposes of sexual exploitation.",Article,1 , Law & Society Review,Dec 8,0,"

"COVID-19 Global Pandemic, Financial Development and Financial Inclusion","['Nathanael Ojong', 'Simplice Asongu']","This chapter examines how the Covid-19 pandemic has affected financial development and financial inclusion in African countries. The study provides both broad perspectives and country-specific frameworks based on selected country cases studies. Some emphasis is placed on the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) that are related to financial inclusion. The study aims to understand what immediate challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has represented to the economies and societies on the one hand and on the other, the effect of the COVID-19 on the interconnected financial systems in terms of consequences of the pandemic. The relevance of the study builds on the importance of these insights in helping both scholars and policy makers understand how the effect of the pandemic on the financial system and by extension, the global economy can be mitigated for more financial inclusion.",Article,1 , SSRN Electronic Journal,Nov 30,0,"

"Place, power, difference: Multiscale research at the dawn of the twenty-first century","['L.L. Gezon', 'Sydney Paulson']","Innovations and debates within political ecology, as well as critiques of the approach as a whole, have motivated serious reflection about the methods, concepts, and studies that make up this relatively new field. As environmental issues become increasingly prominent in local struggles, national debates, and international policies, scholars are paying more attention to conventional politics and to more broadly defined relations of power and difference in interactions among human groups and their biophysical environments. This move has generated questions about the role of politics in environmental scholarship and practice as well as concerns that ardent attention to political phenomena may leave ecological detail in the shadows. In efforts to work more closely with political, economic, and ecological concerns and phenomena, political ecologists have pursued several promising paths: they have looked beyond the local community to explain natural resource use, explored power dynamics in everyday interactions and formal policy arenas, and paid increasing attention to the environmental interests, knowledge, and practices of social groups differentiated by race, ethnicity, gender, or other factors. © 2005 by Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.

Locating the Political in Political Ecology: An Introduction,"['Sydney Paulson', 'Lisa L. Gezon', 'Michael Watts']","Recent debates within political ecology have motivated serious reflection about key concepts and methods in this relatively new field. In the introduction to this special issue, we briefly chart the intellectual genealogy of political ecology, identify vital challenges faced today, and present a new set of studies that respond to these concerns. We conceptualize power as a social relation built on the asymmetrical distribution of resources and risks and locate power in the interactions among, and the processes that constitute, people, places, and resources. Politics, then, are found in the practices and mechanisms through which such power is circulated. The focus here is on politics related to the environment, understood as biophysical phenomena, together with human knowledge and practice. To apply these concepts, we promote multiscale research models that articulate selected ecological phenomena and local social processes, together with regional and global forces and ideas. We also advocate methods for research and practice that are sensitive to relations of difference and power among and within social groups. Rather than dilute ecological dimensions of study, this approach aims to strengthen our ability to account for the dialectical processes through which humans appropriate, contest, and manipulate the world around them.",Article,3 , Human Organization,,0,"

The effects of Asian population substructure on Y STR forensic analyses,"['Bruce Budowle', 'Jianye Ge', 'Joyce Low[...]', 'Ranajit Chakraborty']","A total of 3046 males of Chinese, Malay, Thai, Japanese, and Indian population affinity were previously typed for the Y STR loci DYS19, DYS385 (counted as two loci), DYS389I, DYS389II, DYS390, DYS391, DYS392, DYS393, DYS437, DYS438, DYS439, DYS456, DYS458, DYS635, DYS448, and Y GATA H4 using the AmpFlSTR Yfiler kit. These samples were assessed for population genetic parameters that impact forensic statistical calculations. All population samples were highly polymorphic for the 16 Y STR markers with the marker DYS385 being the most polymorphic, because it is comprised of two loci. Most (2677 out of a total of 2806 distinct haplotypes) of the 16 marker haplotypes observed in the sample populations were represented only once in the data set. Haplotype diversities were greater than 99.57% for the Chinese, Malay, Thai, Japanese, and Indian sample populations. For the Y STR markers, population substructure correction was considered when calculating the rarity of a Y STR profile. An F(ST) value, rather than a R(ST) value, is more appropriate under a forensic model. Because the F(ST) values are very small within the Asian populations, the estimate of the rarity of a haplotype comprised of 10-16 markers does not need substructure correction. However haplotypes with fewer markers may require F(ST) corrections when calculating the rarity of the profile.",Article,8 , Legal Medicine,Nov 17,0,"

The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and local institutions in Ghana’s mining communities: Challenges in understanding barriers to accountability,"['Hevina S. Dashwood', 'Uwafiokun Idemudia', 'Bill Buenar Puplampu', 'Kernaghan Webb']","Motivation The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is a global standard that promotes transparency and accountability in resource-rich countries to improve governance of the extractive sector. Despite improvements in the subnational disclosure of royalty payments, a significant problem is the failure of these efforts to improve accountability and benefits to mining communities. Purpose The article asks how institutions of local governance affect national efforts to improve accountability to mining communities in Ghana on the use of mineral revenues for development. It contributes to the broader theoretical literature on EITI by clarifying what outcomes, if any, can be directly attributed to the disclosure of royalty payments. Methods and approach This qualitative study employs a case-study analysis of EITI adoption in Ghana, one of the first countries to join the initiative. The article contextualizes local governance institutions and dynamics in relation to the royalty disbursement process. It draws on original field research to analyse their role in impeding the expected benefits of royalty disbursements to mining-affected communities. Findings The research identifies deficiencies in local governance structures and processes as they relate to the use of mineral royalties, but also instances of variation in how officials react to EITI. The range of individual actors, institutions and complex processes on which the subnational disbursement of royalties depends, makes it problematic to attribute the absence of improvements directly to Ghana’s EITI. The findings demonstrate that EITI’s role in participating countries is best understood as facilitative and indirect when addressing development outcomes for mining commu

Africa and Food Security,"['Logan Cochrane', 'Melisew Dejene Lemma', 'Nathanael Ojong', 'W C Sambu']","As United Nations Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, noted at the 2021 Africa Regional Food Systems Summit Dialogue, food insecurity is rising in many African countries (see 13 July 2021 address). The global pandemic has not only put global health inequality on display; it has also done the same for food security: nearly one out of five Africans experienced hunger in 2020 – more than double the proportion of any other region. This policy brief highlights the current situation, noting countries with a high prevalence of food insecurity as well as countries where large numbers of people experience hunger. We note the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food security as well as the negative consequences of food insecurity from a nutritional perspective. Before looking forward, this policy brief examines the historical context of social policies and safety nets, using a selection of contemporary case studies. It concludes with recommendations for protecting the right to food for all people at all times (e.g., investing in better data, best fit design, expanding coverage, moving beyond quantity to quality, nutritional diversity and food safety) as well as enabling food system change (e.g., enhancing resilience, transforming systems).",Technical Report,,,Oct 20,0,"

Introduction to climate justice communication (in Research Handbook on Communicating Climate Change),"['Anna Roosvall', 'Matthew Tegelberg']","Theme VIII. Climate Justice Communication: This theme consists of two chapters, one largely theoretical piece, drawing on previous studies to suggest future directions for research, and one applied case study. Both chapters discuss the situations of Indigenous peoples and illuminate challenges of communicating climate justice across diverse communicational and geographical contexts. Roosvall and Tegelberg (Chapter 22) detail how attention to economic, cultural, and political justice must be combined with attention to geographical scope, suggesting that future research consider how geographical scales are combined or disconnected in climate change reporting for diverse types of media. In Chapter 23, Yagodin applies a pluralistic climate justice approach, which includes justice for nature, and zooms in on Russian climate change reporting. He examines how calls for climate justice were largely excluded from journalistic, but not NGO, framings of the 2016 anthrax outbreak on the Yamal peninsula. Together, these contributions highlight possibilities and challenges for justly communicating about climate justice.

"“Let’s Not Have the Perfect Be the Enemy of the Good”: Social Impact Bonds, Randomized Controlled Trials, and the Valuation of Social Programs",['James Williams'],"This article uses the case of “social impact bonds” (SIBs) to explore the role of social science methods in new markets in “social investment.” Pioneered in the UK in 2010, SIBs use private capital to fund social programs with governments paying returns for successful outcomes. Central to the SIB model is the question of evaluation and the method to be used in determining program outcomes and investor returns. In the United States, the randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been the dominant method. However, this has not been without controversy. Some SIB practitioners and investors have argued that, while this may be the perfect tool, the need to grow the SIB market demands a more pragmatic approach. Drawing from a three-year study of SIBs, and informed by Science and Technology Studies (STS)-inspired work on valuation and the social life of methods, the article explores RCTs as both a valuation technology central to SIB design and the object of a micropolitics of valuation which has impeded market growth. It is the relationship between, and the politics of, evaluation and valuation that is a key lesson of the SIB experiment and an important insight for future research on “social investment” and other settings where methods are constitutive of financial value.",Article,1 ," Science, Technology & Human Values",Oct 12,0,"

Formalizing Secularism as a Regime of Restrictions and Protections: The Case of Quebec (Canada) and Geneva (Switzerland),['Amelie Barras'],"In 2019, the province of Quebec and the canton of Geneva passed bills establishing their states as “secular.” While each law is, to a certain extent, context specific, both present noteworthy similarities. First, neutrality (the cornerstone of laïcité ) is articulated around two elements: (1) restrictions that affect the religious practices of public servants belonging to minority religions and (2) protections for Christian symbols constructed as “cultural.” The article questions the implications for inclusive citizenship of formalizing regulatory regimes that differentiate between “religion” and “culture.” Second, a comparative lens enables an analysis of how, through whom, and why similar regimes of regulation travel from one area of the world to another. The article argues for the importance of considering transnational influences when analyzing the regulation of religion to better (1) understand why particular models of secularism gain traction and (2) capture power dynamics structuring these processes of traction.",Article,1 , Canadian journal of law and society = Revue canadienne de droit et société,Oct 9,0,"

Life after trafficking: reintegration experiences of human trafficking survivors in Nigeria,"['Uwafiokun Idemudia', 'Nnenna Okoli', 'Mary Goitom', 'Sylvia Bawa']","Purpose Reintegration programs have emerged as part of the regimes of care for survivors of human trafficking. However, empirical analysis of the reintegration outcomes for survivors remains limited in the African context. Hence, this paper aims to examine the challenges and opportunities of reintegration assistance programs for survivors of human trafficking in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on qualitative methods of data collection and analysis, this study conducted semi-structured interviews with repatriated women who have accessed reintegration assistance in Nigeria, and data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings The findings suggest that while the reintegration programs might address the procedural aspect of reintegration, the achievement of substantive reintegration remains incomplete. This is because of the structural conditions of the context within which reintegration is supposed to occur. Practical implications There is a need to take seriously the distinction between the reintegration of survivors into a new community or a former community in the design of a regime of care for survivors of human trafficking in Africa. Crucially, the focus on procedural reintegration should not also divert attention away from the structural conditions and reforms needed to ensure survivors achieve substantive reintegration. Originality/value This paper contributes to the limited literature on life after trafficking and demonstrates the strengths and limitations of reintegration programs as a regime of care for survivors of human trafficking. In addition, this study empirically grounded the theoretical distinction between different aspects of the process of reintegration.",Article,1 ," International Journal of Migration, Health and Social Care",Sep 15,0,"

This paper explores the shifting role of the state in CSR, and the way the features of a state affect CSR in the context of a developing country. The paper adopts a strategic-relational approach that recognises the variability in state capacities over time and space. Empirically, it draws upon secondary sources and interviews with stakeholder groups. Our findings reveal the complex nature of CSR and the dynamic, yet resilient, role of state actors in a context of strong state–business interdependence, institutional incompatibility, and fragmented powers across diverse state branches. While the state (re)claims control over CSR when its socio-economic goals are challenged, it tends to move from emphasising state control to co-ordinating complex modes of CSR governance.",Conference Paper,,,Aug 13,0,"

Contemporary slavery: The rhetoric of global human rights campaigns,"['Annie Bunting', 'J. Quirk']","This volume brings together a cast of leading experts to carefully explore how the history and iconography of slavery has been invoked to support a series of government interventions, activist projects, legal instruments, and rhetorical performances. However well-intentioned these interventions might be, they nonetheless remain subject to a host of limitations and complications. Recent efforts to combat contemporary slavery are too often sensationalist, self-serving, and superficial and, therefore, end up failing the crucial test of speaking truth to power. The widely held notion that antislavery is one of those rare issues that ""transcends"" politics or ideology is only sustainable because the underlying issues at stake have been constructed and demarcated in a way that minimizes direct challenges to dominant political and economic interests. This must change. By providing an original approach to the underlying issues at stake, Contemporary Slavery will help readers understand the political practices that have been concealed beneath the popular rhetoric and establishes new conversations between scholars of slavery and trafficking and scholars of human rights and social movements.",Book,,,Aug 2,0,"

Can “the oven bird” Migrate North of the border?,['Annie Bunting'],"In David Engel’s elegant 1984 piece “The Oven Bird’s Song: Insiders, Outsiders, and Personal Injuries in an American Community, he documents legal perceptions of residents of the pseudonymous Sander County, Illinois that were disconnected from the legal realities he measured, and concluded that these perceptions were reactions to social change that produced greater pluralism in the community. This gave rise to “symbolic efforts … to preserve a sense of meaning and coherence in the face of social changes that they found threatening and confusing. Residents sought to “recall and reaffirm an untainted world that existed nowhere but in their imaginations. These conclusions are fascinating and prescient, and have led many of us since then to probe legal perceptions in the face of growing normative pluralism. Much like the study of residents of Sander County in Engel’s “Oven Bird’s Song, Carole Greenhouse writes about perceptions of disputes and litigation in a small town she calls Hopewell in Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town (1986). In Greenhouse’s preface, she discusses her own assumptions going into her study. She writes: I went to Hopewell in September 1973 to study dispute settlement in an American community, and my assumption, or hope, was that the role of the court in the social fabric of a town would be thrown into relief if the community was in the process of change. The rest of the book should make it clear why such a legal study was not possible in this community and also how it is that one can begin a study of an American community by looking for conflict and end by considering a person’s relationship to God.

Humanitarian and Human Rights Surveillance: The Challenge to Border Surveillance and Invisibility?,['Ozgun Topak'],"The European border regime has traditionally rested on the hidden surveillance activities of border authorities, which have contributed to human rights violations (including “push-back” and “left-to-die” practices) and a rising migrant death toll. Recently a number of humanitarian and activist organizations, including Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Sea-Watch, and WatchTheMed, have organized to aid migrants in distress at sea using surveillance technologies, ranging from drones to GPS. By doing so, they presented a challenge to the European border surveillance regime. In dialogue with the concept of countersurveillance, this paper introduces the concepts of humanitarian surveillance and human rights surveillance and deploys them to examine and categorize the activities of MOAS, MSF, Sea-Watch, and WatchTheMed. Humanitarian surveillance narrowly focuses on aiding victims of surveillance without problematizing the logic and hierarchies of surveillance, while human rights surveillance operates as a form of countersurveillance; it aims to protect and advance the human rights of victims of surveillance and expose human rights violations committed by authorities through opposing the hierarchies of surveillance. The paper shows how civilian groups incorporate elements of humanitarian and human rights surveillance in their activities at varying levels and discusses the extent to which they challenge the European border surveillance regime.",Article,9 , Surveillance & Society,Jul 15,0,"

"Migrant protest in times of crisis: politics, ethics and the sacred from below",['Ozgun Topak'],"This paper focuses on the 300 Migrant Hunger Strikers event in Greece to explore the material conditions of possibility for migrant politics in times of crisis. It identifies three elements that played determinant roles in the articulation of the event: the politics of equality enacted by migrants, the ethics of hospitality and witnessing enacted by the Greek activists and host populations and the sacredness of the event. Critically engaging with the theories of Rancière, Derrida, Agamben and Durkheim, this paper demonstrates how these elements encountered and how their encounter helped migrants to achieve rights, albeit limited and temporary. Moving beyond the particularity of the event, this paper also highlights the event’s importance for migrant politics in times of austerity, and increased surveillance and racism against migrants. Despite its limited and temporary success, the event demonstrates how a politics of equality, ethical openness and respect for human life can form the basis of true cosmopolitan universality. The event also demonstrates how cosmopolitan universality is constructed from below by the migrants, who despite their undocumented status, engaged in an act of citizenship to demand equality.",Article,6 , Citizenship Studies,,0,"

The New Borders of the European Union: Digital Surveillance and Social Sorting,['Ozgun Topak'],"n this paper the emergence of the digital borders in the EU is analyzed. Alt- hough borders have always been the spaces where individuals are sorted from each other, the database technologies extend this process of sorting to every- where within the EU. The developments in the database and biometrics technology have made it possible to identify people automatically and to reach their records even long after they have entered the EU. Digitization and diffusion of the borders will affect the already disadvantaged segments of the population, such as undocumented migrants, asylum seekers and ordinary travellers, in a negative way. These categories are now put under continual surveillance as if they are potential criminals or terrorists. Yet, the diffusion of the borders with digital technologies should not mean that the localized controls at the external borders have lost their significance. In fact, with the EUROSUR, now the territorial controls have also intensified. The EUROSUR will survey the external EU borders with sophisticated surveillance systems, including manned and un- manned aerial vehicles and satellites, in order prevent irregular migrants from reaching the EU. This paper is divided into three main sections. In the discussion that follows, the paper draws on the surveillance and border studies literature to develop a con- ceptual framework for understanding the digital borders. Second, the paper ex- amines the new EU surveillance mechanisms in detail and their effects on dif- ferent groups. The final section concludes by summarizing the arguments of the paper and discussing the consequences of digital sorting on European citizenship.",Chapter,,,,0,"

The paper also discusses the biopolitical consequences of these practices for migrants such as physical illnesses and injuries, and psychological disorders. The paper contributes to the scholarship on biopolitical borders in two main ways. First, through conceptualising hotspot as a form of biopolitical borderzone and demonstrating the specific biopolitical practices in the Lesvos hotspot and their effects on migrants. Second, through highlighting the key role of waiting in the operations of the biopolitical border.

"Solar Home Systems in South Asia: Examining Adoption, Energy Consumption, and Social Practices",['Nathanael Ojong'],"Renewable electricity generation from solar energy has rapidly increased in South Asia. This paper presents a systematic review of 79 scholarly papers on the topic of solar home system adoption, energy consumption, and social practices in South Asia. Using an intersectionality lens, the paper demonstrates that various categories of difference, such as gender, age, class, and ethnicity, intersect and shape the adoption of this technology in South Asia. Utilizing a social practice theory lens, the paper shows that solar home systems shape the spatial and temporal arrangements and practices of members of households that have adopted the technology, as well as their counterparts who have not. This technology has a practical but also symbolic function; the symbolic function and social meaning are derived from the economic and socio-cultural contexts. As this renewable energy technology is embedded in economic and socio-cultural contexts, people reconfigure it in creative ways to meet their everyday energy needs.

First piloted in Peterborough prison in 2010, SIBs use private investment to fund social programs with governments paying a return if these programs are successful. Drawing from research on SIBs in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, the paper explores this effort to turn (re)offending into an investment, its challenges and how SIBs reveal a financial ‘style of reasoning’ that is re-shaping the ‘culture of crime control’ with critical implications for providers, programs and participants.",Article,1 , British Journal of Criminology,Jul 6,0,"

Heterogeneous Combustion of Porous Graphite Particles in Normal and Microgravity,"['Harsha Chelliah', 'Fletcher Miller', 'David Pantano', 'Aslan Kasimov']","Combustion of solid fuel particles has many important applications, including power generation and space propulsion systems. The current models available for describing the combustion process of these particles, especially porous solid particles, include various simplifying approximations. One of the most limiting approximations is the lumping of the physical properties of the porous fuel with the heterogeneous chemical reaction rate constants. The primary objective of the present work is to develop a rigorous model that could decouple such physical and chemical effects from the global heterogeneous reaction rates. For the purpose of validating this model, experiments with porous graphite particles of varying sizes and porosity are being performed at NASA Lewis Research Center. The details of the experimental and theoretical model development effort are described.",Article,,,Jul 5,0,"

Workers Confront Apartheid: Comparing Canadian Labor Solidarity Campaigns against South African and Israeli Apartheid,['Katherine Nastovski'],"This article explores the challenges of building international labor solidarity by comparing two campaigns that developed inside the Canadian labor movement. I critically compare and assess the campaign against South African apartheid in the 1980s and the more recent efforts to oppose Israeli apartheid. Both campaigns are examples of grassroots international labor solidarity, where organizers sought to build international solidarity through member mobilization and a focus on the power of workers to engage in solidarity actions. I examine how these union activists organized within their unions, and how their organizational differences and the ideological and political contexts they organized within shaped their successes and limitations. Drawing from the work of Antonio Gramsci, I argue that these campaigns were sites of counter-hegemonic practice both because of the analysis and critiques they offered but also because of the nature of their organizing.",Article,4 , WorkingUSA,,0,"
