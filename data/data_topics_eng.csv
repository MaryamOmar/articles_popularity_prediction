Self-report pain intensity scales are frequently used within assessment. In contrast to formal studies of validity and reliability, we examine administration of, and responses to these scales in everyday palliative care. Methods We searched episodes of pain scale use in a dataset of (video/audio-recorded) UK palliative care consultations involving five doctors, 37 terminally ill patients and their companions. We found five, and applied the techniques and tools of conversation analysis to characterise scales’ administration and functioning. Results Generally, the patients responded to scales by reporting multiple aspects of pain; the doctors supported and encouraged this. In two episodes, the scales generated misunderstandings. The doctors worked to resolve these in ways that avoided implying the patient was at fault. Conclusion Pain intensity scales can yield richer information than just intensity. They can also generate misunderstandings and social friction which take skill and effort to resolve. Practice Implications Patients tend to respond to pain intensity scales by reporting on multiple aspects of pain, professionals should support them in this. These scales sometimes generate misunderstandings. To preserve the therapeutic relationship, professionals should work to resolve these without implying the patient is to blame.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02071058, 0.0, 0.07085032, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07805233, 0.0]",community_service,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.55170516e-05 9.99999000e-01

This syndrome may lead to depression, suicidal ideation, and increased academic dropout. However, there is a scarcity of evidence-based interventions to prevent it. The aim of this longitudinal study was to identify factors that may reduce students’ burnout and foster their well-being, and upon which effective interventions can be developed.MethodsA total of 1,117 medical students from eight Chilean universities were asked to complete a set of validated scales in 2015 and 2 years later, in 2017. The measures included distress, burnout, positive mental health, academic engagement, and dispositional mindfulness. Using logistic regressions and a two-wave latent change score model, the predictive power of these variables on burnout and flourishing (an optimal state of mental health) was studied, as well as their covariance across time.ResultsIn total, 639 (57.2%) students answered the questionnaires in T1 and T2; 54.4% reported burnout in T1 and 56.2% in T2. Levels of dispositional mindfulness (the ability to pay attention to one’s sensations, thoughts, and emotions in everyday life) predicted lower probabilities of burning out at 2 years, whereas having experienced burnout in T1 doubled these odds. Dispositional mindfulness, academic engagement, and flourishing at T1 predicted greater odds of flourishing 2 years later, while depression decreased these odds.Conclusions Dispositional mindfulness was the most powerful predictive factor of students’ burnout and flourishing. As dispositional mindfulness can be nurtured through practice, incorporating mindfulness training into undergraduate medical programs may help reduce burnout a

Evidence shows that transfer of skills into practice is limited. Training can be improved by building on in-depth evidence and reflecting the complexity of actual interactions. Scientific advances from direct observational ‘conversation analytic’ studies of conversations in healthcare and beyond provide this evidence, but the linguistic complexities are often inaccessible to clinical trainers. We address this dilemma via a novel training initiative, ‘RealTalk’, designed to support trainers by increasing the authenticity and evidence base of end-of-life communication training for health and social care staff and trainees. METHODS We conducted a development study to create a communication intervention for testing. In collaboration with stakeholders, we identified the rationale for the content and mode of delivery, converted research findings into an applied intervention, and tested and refined the intervention prior to launching the finished product. RESULTS Using a conversation analytic approach, we made and analysed video recordings of real-life palliative care consultations in a large UK hospice. We transformed our findings into preliminary training resources comprising clips from the video recordings and accompanying written materials. We shared the materials with an advisory group of clinicians, educators and researchers. Based on feedback, we modified the materials. Trainers in UK higher education institutions, healthcare organisations and independent hospices piloted our materials within their own training and fed back.

The primary aim of this study was to translate and validate WEMWBS for use in Swahili-speaking populations. This will facilitate measurement and understanding of wellbeing in these populations, evaluation of policy and practice, and enable international comparisons. The secondary aim was to describe mental wellbeing in the participants of the Girls’ Education Challenge (GEC) project in Tanzania, run by CAMFED and funded through the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. Specifically, to examine sociodemographic characteristics associated with higher and lower wellbeing in this population. Methods We created a short questionnaire including WEMWBS and similar scales for comparison, socio-demographic information and self-reported health. This was translated into Swahili using gold standard methodology. We aimed to use this tool to collect data from secondary school students (girls and boys), learner guides, teacher mentors and teachers taking part in the GEC programme in Tanzania. Quantitative data analysis examined internal consistency of WEMWBS, correlation with comparator scales and confirmatory factor analysis. Qualitative work to assess acceptability and comprehensibility of WEMWBS and conceptual understanding of mental wellbeing was carried out through focus groups with GEC participants.

We focus on a cohort of Indigenous children in Australia who have been followed from infancy and for whom rich information on childcare use and cognitive outcomes is observed. Compared to Indigenous children who never participated in childcare, Indigenous children who participated in childcare performed better on several early cognitive outcomes. Using regression and propensity score matching, we show that this difference is driven by selection into childcare, with children from more advantaged families being more likely to attend formal childcare.

However, the mechanisms underlying these relationships remain to be explicated. In particular, few studies have investigated the relationships between the psychosocial influences that children are exposed to early in life, and longer‐term cortisol output. This study aims to contribute to the literature by exploring how disadvantaged young children's experiences of family adversity, and parenting and family functioning, are related to their long‐term cortisol levels. A sample of 60 children (26 males, M age=4.25 years, SD=1.68) and their mothers (M age=34.18 years, SD=7.11) from a low income population took part in a single assessment. Mothers completed questionnaires on the family environment, parenting practices, and child behavior. Children provided a hair sample for cortisol assay, and anthropometric measures. A parsimonious multivariate regression model (including potential predictors identified by a selection algorithm) was used to investigate the correlates of hair cortisol concentration (HCC) in children. Higher levels of social exclusion, being male, and younger age were each associated with higher HCC. Maternal nurturing and emotion coaching were associated with lower HCC. Findings suggest that chronic stress may underlie relationships between adversity and its long‐term effects, and that HCC offers a promising method for examining chronic stress in children and evaluating interventions by which it can be ameliorated.","[0.0, 0.00352587, 0.00413617, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05878738, 0.25983136, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",child_family,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06

This study aims to fill the research gap by examining the types of barriers that hinder e-commerce utilization by Thai SMEs in the F&B and retail services, as well as their key determinants. Unlike e-commerce adoption, e-commerce utilization can capture the full range of e-commerce engagement. The survey’s findings indicate that organizational barriers significantly inhibit e-commerce utilization. Estimations from the structural equation modelling (SEM) show that exports, e-commerce tools, government support, and internal and external e-commerce platforms can enhance e-commerce utilization. In addition, business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce can increase the exports of Thai SMEs, while older entrepreneurs and SMEs tend to neglect e-commerce.

While digitalization of public libraries already attracted significant scholarly attention, the evidence of its contribution to the acquisition of cultural skills and knowledge and social mobility remains limited, as does the conceptual understanding of links between digitalization, cultural capital, and social stratification. This article draws on two disconnected bodies of research, the sociological analysis of cultural capital and stratification and research on digital divides. To bridge these two bodies of research, the interplay of cultural and digital capital in public libraries was investigated. The extensive dataset from the UK Taking Part Survey (2016–17) was analyzed using two-step cluster analysis and multinomial regression models to explore the contrasting profiles of contemporary library users. Results identify four distinct user groups: Traditional, Active, Family, and Tech Access, which possess different degrees of cultural and digital capital, have different demographic profiles, and benefit from digitalized libraries in different ways. If libraries are to fulfil their role in reducing social inequalities, it is important that they tailor their digital services to the specific characteristics of each user group. This approach also provides a useful template for exploring the interplay of digitalization and (in)equality in other cultural institutions.","[0.0314804151, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00578940168, 0.00404236724, 0.0432484148, 0.0322943748, 5.4021111e-05, 0.0, 0.00277023624, 0.0267940164, 0.0211901263]",education,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

We argue that, in such hybrid societies, social inequalities are generated by several mechanisms of similar strength: exploitative market mechanisms (based on economic capital) and different types of social closure mechanisms (based on political and social capital). Their influences are intertwined and cannot be analytically isolated or reduced to a common foundation. Therefore, occupational class analysis in these societies can have only limited explanatory power. In an attempt to overcome these challenges, we were forced to modify the instruments of several established approaches to class analysis. These modifications included (1) a reconceptualization of Bourdieusian notions of political, social, and cultural capital, (2) a different operationalization of social space, (3) identification of specific mechanisms of generating social inequalities, (4) paying attention to both practical and discursive classifications of lifestyles in the establishment of symbolic boundaries, and (5) relying on differential association analysis for identifying class boundaries. Our analysis's final result is a model that enables studying general social inequality, that is, generalized social advantage/disadvantage, in SEE post‐socialist societies.","[0.06513549, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0011456, 0.03674737, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00104802]",politics,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01

Based on a two-wave panel survey in 17 mostly European countries, our study targets the role of both legacy news brands (TV, radio, newspapers) and so-called contemporary news media (Internet-based and social media) during this global health crisis. Our results show an overall rise of news use across countries, but only for some types of news media. We find an increase of TV news consumption, and a higher reliance on social media and the Internet for news and information. This indicates that in times of crises and an unusually strong need for orientation, people mainly turn to news sources that are easily available and offer a more immediate coverage.

Some of this work, however, seems to present social capital as inherently positive, suggesting that increasing stocks in social capital is fundamental to the desistance process. Knowledge surrounding exactly how social capital is utilized within the desistance process, with the exception of acquiring social capital as a social good, remains underexplored. Through an analysis of the desistance narratives of young adult men serving community orders under the supervision of the probation service in England and Wales, this article argues that, instead of being considered to be inherently good, social capital is perhaps better thought of as value neutral, consisting of both positive and negative aspects (some of which occur simultaneously). Desistance, then, is not simply about obtaining social capital (because many people with convictions possess stocks of social capital that supported their offending); rather it is about reorienting the type of capital available to them at any given time, from relationships that imbue ‘anti-social capital’ to those that imbue ‘pro-social capital’. This distinction has significant theoretical and policy interventions, arguing that it is pro-social capital that the literature makes reference to in terms of supporting desistance efforts. The article concludes by offering some tentative suggestions for future research, along with ways in which this distinction can further support how we operationalize desistance within criminal justice policy and practice.","[0.02649933, 0.00155907, 0.0, 0.01060922, 0.03299739, 0.0, 0.00898976, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00797056, 0.03969215, 0.0]",community_service,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

However, it is also widely noted that the transformation of one’s social identitie(s) is vital for the cessation of other, non-addictive behaviours, such as offending. Interestingly, the discussion of the role of social identity tansformation in relation to both desistance and recovery simultaneously has seldom been undertaken.Methods: Drawing on primary research consisting of 20 double narrative interviews with young adult offenders on an Intensive Community Order, the paper builds upon the two most prominent social identity models surrounding addictive behaviour, the Social Identity Model of Recovery and the Social Identity Model of Cessation Maintenance in order to develop a social identity model which aids our understanding of desistance and recovery processes.Results: The paper presents a Social Identity Model of Transition (SIMOT), allowing for the synergies between desistance and recovery as processes of transition to come to light.Conclusion: SIMOT allows for an understanding of the role of social identity transformation in the transient nature of desistance and recovery processes.

Vaccine hesitancy is a long-standing problem, but it has assumed great urgency due to the pandemic. By early 2021, the United Kingdom had the world’s highest Covid-19 mortality per million of population. Our survey of a nationally representative sample of UK adults ( N = 5,114) measured socio-demographics, social and political attitudes, media diet for getting news about Covid-19, and intention to use social media and personal messaging apps to encourage or discourage vaccination against Covid-19. Cluster analysis identified six distinct media diet groups: news avoiders, mainstream/official news samplers, super seekers, omnivores, the social media dependent, and the TV dependent. We assessed whether these media diets, together with key attitudes, including Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy, conspiracy mentality, and the news-finds-me attitude (meaning giving less priority to active monitoring of news and relying more on one’s online networks of friends for information), predict the intention to encourage or discourage vaccination. Overall, super-seeker and omnivorous media diets are more likely than other media diets to be associated with the online encouragement of vaccination. Combinations of (a) news avoidance and high levels of the news-finds-me attitude and (b) social media dependence and high levels of conspiracy mentality are most likely to be associated with online discouragement of vaccination. In the direct statistical model, a TV-dependent media diet is more likely to be associated with online discouragement of vaccination, but the moderation model shows that a TV-dependent diet most strongly attenuates the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and discouraging vaccination. Our findings support public health communication based on four main methods. First, direct contact, through the post, workplace, or community structures, and through phone counseling via local health services, could reach the news avoiders. Second, TV public information advertisements should point to authoritative information sources, such as National Health Service (NHS) and other public health websites, which should then feature clear and simple ways for people to share material among their online social networks. Third, informative social media campaigns will provide super seekers with good resources to share, while also encouraging the social media dependent to browse away from social media platforms and visit reliable and authoritative online sources. Fourth, social media companies should expand and intensify their removal of vaccine disinformation and anti-vax accounts, and such efforts should be monitored by well-resourced, independent organizations.","[0.0151040764, 0.000135046573, 0.146388024, 0.0, 0.00114773092, 0.0276002377, 0.0179948519, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0253566253, 0.00672096595, 0.00174960253]",covid,"[9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06

Taking these concerns as our point of departure, we explore the relationships between vaping and smoking among a cohort of young people. Methods: Qualitative longitudinal methods with a diverse sample of 36 14-18-year olds from the UK city of Leicester. A total of 66 depth interviews conducted across two phases separated by 6-12 months. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Findings: We highlight a complex 'tangle' of connections between substances/risk behaviours recounted to us by our adolescent study participants, including multiple and multilinear relationships between vaping and smoking. These findings problematise some of the core axioms of the notion of gateways as an explanatory model of causality and sequential connection between smoking and vaping. They also throw into question gateway logics more fundamentally. While many of our study participants themselves consciously invoked ideas of 'gateway effects', the accounts they produced repeatedly disrupted the logics of connection (between e-cigarettes and smoking; one set of behaviours and another) presupposed in gateway theory and our own early lines of questioning. Accordingly, we explore how cultural understandings of gateway effects are invoked by users in accounting for their vaping and smoking behaviours, noting the potential influence of these ideas upon the very processes they are understood to apprehend.

Methods: One hundred and twenty-nine consecutive patients (mean age 36±8 years) with middle cerebral artery stenosis and without Moyamoya disease were evaluated by HRMRI. The stenosis was classified as eccentric stenosis, concentric stenosis, and mixed stenosis if both eccentric and concentric stenosis occurred in one vessel. The clinical data and vessel wall properties were analyzed among the subtypes. Results: Eccentric stenosis was found in 86 (69.4%) patients, while concentric stenosis was found in 26 patients (21.0%) and mixed stenosis in 12(9.7%) patients. The patients with eccentric stenosis were older (p<0.001) and more likely had atherosclerosis risk factors (p=0.024). The patients with concentric stenosis were more likely female, and aged 35 years old or younger. All mixed stenosis were high-grade (>70%) stenotic. All concentric stenosis showed constrictive remodeling, while eccentric and mixed stenosis had heterogeneous remodeling types. In 34 patients with available enhanced images, ring enhancement was revealed in 8/9(88.9%) concentric stenosis and 5/5(100%) mixed stenosis, but only in 3/20(15%) eccentric stenosis (P<0.001). Ten of twelve (83.3%) patients with mixed stenosis were symptomatic, more frequently than the patients with eccentric stenosis (57.0%, p=0.072) and the patients with concentric stenosis (50%, p=0.052).

Patients with both the characteristic moyamoya vasculopathy and the associated conditions are categorized as moyamoya syndrome. These conditions include sickle cell disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, Down’s disease, cranial therapeutic irradiation and other rare diseases. Moyamoya syndrome associated with Graves’ disease has been rarely reported and the underlying coexisting mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study is to identify the clinical and radiological findings of the patients with simultaneous diagnosis of moyamoya syndrome and Graves’ disease. Possible mechanisms predisposing these individuals to ischemic accidents are discussed. Methods We retrospectively identified 12 patients in Peking Union Medical College Hospital and 4 patients in 307 hospital of PLA between May 2000 and December 2010. All patients were female and mean age (range) was 35.13±12.34 years (11-57 years). The patients were diagnosed with Graves’ disease in endocrinology clinic which meet the full diagnostic criteria and no atherosclerotic factor was found in them. Moyamoya vasculopathy was definitely or probably diagnosed by digital subtract angiography or magnetic resonance angiography.

Methods: Fifty-four consecutive patients (mean age,29±6 years) with middle cerebral artery stenosis were evaluated by HRMRI. The morphology of artery lesions and clinical data were analyzed. Probable atherosclerotic plaques were diagnosed by the presence of eccentric wall thickening. Probable non-atherosclerotic lesions were diagnosed by the presence of concentric wall thickening and absence of plaques.On quantitative analysis, when constrictive remodeling can be identified by visual inspection, vessel shrinkage was defined. Results: Plaques were found in 32 (59%) patients, including 13 patients without any atherosclerosis risk factors. The patients with a plaque tended to be older (p=0.061), male (p=0.013), and more likely have atherosclerosis risk factors(59% vs. 23%, p=0.012), expansive artery remodeling (37.5% vs. 0,p<0.001), and infarctions (75% vs. 45%, p=0.044). The non-atherosclerotic lesions more often displayed vessel shrinkage (100% vs. 31%, p<0.001) and concentric wall enhancement (83% vs.13%, p<0.001). Conclusion: In this study, atherosclerosis accounted for a high percentage of intracranial artery stenosis in patients younger than 35 years when HRMRI was introduced into the diagnostic setting.

Greatly increased requests for digital (e.g. phones) and third party (e.g. school or mental health records) evidence from victim-survivors after the R Vs Allan case in 2017, had intensified victim-survivor scrutiny and reduced police charging and court summons to their current low. With sexual offences causing immense distress and harm to those victimized, and victim-survivors not having the confidence with the criminal justice system due to aggressive questioning, leaving them feeling as if they are on trial, it is perhaps not so surprising that few victim-survivors report to the police. The criminal justice system is not only failing victim-survivors, it is harming many of them. In previous publications we called for independent legal representation for victim-survivors to reduce the trauma associated with needless scrutiny of victim-survivor’s personal lives. Independent legal representation aims to provide legal support, aid, and advice to complainants in order to prevent aggressive and inappropriate questioning, help victim-survivors with data consent forms and also aims to prevent further damage to victim-survivors’ mental health. Whilst we welcome HM Government’s pledge to consult on and pilot access to legal advice to rape victim-survivors, this delays rolling out this service across England and Wales when there has already been an evaluation of such a service in England, the system is already proposed in Scotland, and Ireland already has independent legal representation, as does much of Europe.","[0.0, 0.05433716, 0.01924373, 0.00457687, 0.07017129, 0.00441484, 0.0, 0.01308852, 0.0, 0.08093619, 0.00220513, 0.01817735]",criminology,"[1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01

Their success in doing so is commonly monitored in terms of how many citizens are below a poverty line set relative to median income, and by how far below it they fall (the ‘poverty gap’). Yet the threshold below which this gap starts to be measured is arbitrary, begging the question of what level of low income needs addressing. A more ambitious measure, presented in this paper, considers the extent to which people fall short of a benchmark representing a socially agreed minimum standard. This ‘low income gap’ can be used to represent the distance a society has to go to eliminate income that is undesirably low. The paper presents the indicator, its meaning and some recent trends in the United Kingdom, where the methodology behind the indicator has been pioneered. The results demonstrate that this empirically derived benchmark has the potential to be of value in other countries, in assessing whether they are making progress in reducing low income.","[0.00822797, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01432427, 0.00291546, 0.0, 0.04957944, 0.01558719, 0.12145697, 0.00994957, 0.00086702, 0.0]",economy,"[8.93174312e-05 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

Commentators often assume that high rates of progression to third, fourth and higher order births result from the higher fertility of women who migrated to the UK from regions of the world where large families are common. Less attention has focused on the role of serial partnering where repartnered couples cement their commitment with a ‘shared child’. This paper provides new empirical evidence as to the relative importance of increased international migration and increased experience of multiple partnerships in fostering higher order births among British women now aged 45+ who were born 1940-1969. We conclude that migration from high fertility regions, and the experience of multiple partnerships are both associated with progression to third and fourth birth. However, the likelihood of going on to have a third or fourth birth has remained similar across these birth cohorts for women who were born in the UK (to UK-born parents), and those who have only been married once, suggesting that additional factors encourage large families in the UK.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.13072169, 0.0, 0.00201356, 0.03897599, 0.11267586, 0.00362972, 0.0, 0.00441205, 0.00413546]",women,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

In addition, polysome profiling and tissue microarray and immunohistochemical staining were also used. The statistical significance of the difference was analyzed by ANOVA and post hoc Dunnett’s test.ResultsPHGDH is the first enzyme responsible for serine biosynthesis pathway. The current study demonstrated that PHGDH is upregulated in platin-resistant ovarian cancer cells and tissues at the protein level. Importantly, knockdown of PHGDH suppressed, while overexpression of PHGDH increased the survival upon cisplatin exposure, invasiveness and spheroid formation of ovarian cancer cells. The current study demonstrated that PHGDH translation was upregulated in platin-resistant ovarian cancer. In addition, our study provided evidence that LncRNA RMRP (RNA Component of Mitochondrial RNA Processing Endoribonuclease) was upregulated in platin-resistant ovarian cancer, which promoted enrichment of RNA binding protein DDX3X (DEAD-Box Helicase 3 X-Linked) on the PHGDH mRNA to promote its translation.Conclusion Collectively, the current study described that PHGDH was upregulated and conferred resistance of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin, suggesting that cisplatin resistance could be overcome

However, most medical curricula do not teach self-care skills. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted medical education causing increased distress among students. Aim: To report the implementation and impact of an eight-week multifaceted mindfulness-based self-care program on medical students’ distress and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Methods: One hundred twenty-three fourth-year medical students attended the program as part of a mandatory course from April to May 2020, during the rising phase of COVID-19 in Chile. They were evaluated using validated tests before and immediately after the program. The measures included burnout, dispositional mindfulness, perceived stress, traumatic stress reactions, general well-being, resilience, and stress coping strategies. Results: Burnout prevalence decreased from 48% to 24%, whereas students with high dispositional mindfulness increased from 25% to 44%. Burnout reduction was mostly due to decreased emotional exhaustion. Additionally, students reported lower levels of stress, self-blaming, and traumatic stress reactions alongside an increased use of active coping strategies and resilience levels after the program.

The National Probation Service (NPS) covered State work whilst the 35 existing Probation Trusts were replaced by 21 Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs). Staff were allocated to either side of the divide but all remained as probation officers. The effect was that the existing probation service lost control of all but 30,000 of the most high risk cases, with the other 220,000 low to medium risk offenders being farmed out to private firms. Privatisation was justified as the only available way of achieving important policy objectives of extending post release supervision to offenders on short sentences, a group who are the most prolific offenders with high reconviction rates yet who receive no statutory support. This book describes the process by which the probation service became privatised, assessing its impact on the probation service itself, and on the criminal justice system generally. It considers both the justifications for privatisation, as well as the criticisms of it, and asks to what extent the probation service can survive such changes, and what future it has as a service dedicated to the welfare of offenders. It demonstrates how the privatisation of probation can be seen as a trend away from traditional public service in criminal justice towards an emphasis on efficiency and cost effectiveness. This book is essential reading for criminology students engaged with criminal justice, social policy, probation, punishment and working with offenders. It will also be key reading for practitioners and po

As such, it has limited capacity to provide a holistic account of the causes and consequences of audience engagement with COVID-19 news, or to consider the impact of systemic political and media factors. To compensate for that, we examine a large set of qualitative interviews and media diaries collected in four eastern European countries during the first wave of the pandemic. We show that changes in news consumption—including the resurgence of television and decline of print consumption—were not driven solely by audience demand for up-to-date information, but also by practical constrains of home-bound life in lockdown, and the introduction of live briefings. Our findings underscore disruption and uncertainty as key elements of audience experiences and highlight the markedly privatized and depoliticized nature of public debate in the early phase of the pandemic. We argue that the pandemic was an unpredictable, open-ended, and exhausting media event with high potential for divisiveness and polarization, especially in contexts marked by low levels of media freedom, declining democratic standards, and elite-led politicization of the crisis.","[0.02728053, 0.0, 0.18145064, 0.0, 0.00225558, 0.02183276, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00608415, 0.01902578, 0.0, 0.02722812]",covid,"[9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

A distinction is made between precise and round numbers. Historically, using round numbers to estimate the spread of disease gave way in the 19th century to the sort precise, but not necessarily accurate, statistics that are now being used to record COVID-19. However, round numbers have continued to exert rhetorical, ‘semi-magical’ power by simultaneously conveying both quantity and quality. This is demonstrated in examples from the British government’s claims about COVID-19. The paper illustrates how senior members of the UK government use ‘good’ round numbers to frame their COVID-19 goals and to announce apparent achievements.

However, there is still a lack of comparative research on how citizens combine the usage of different media and how that is related to political knowledge. To fill this void, we use a unique cross-national survey about the online and offline media use habits of more than 28,000 individuals in 17 European countries. Our aim is to (i) profile different types of news consumers and (ii) understand how each user profile is linked to political knowledge acquisition. Our results show that five user profiles – news minimalists, social media news users, traditionalists, online news seekers, and hyper news consumers – can be identified, although the prevalence of these profiles varies across countries. Findings further show that both traditional and online-based news diets are correlated with higher political knowledge. However, online-based news use is more widespread in Southern Europe, where it is associated with lower levels of political knowledge than in Northern Europe.

We identify a range of obscure statistical indices developed in other fields that measure the strength of ‘qualitative variation’. Using original data, we compare the performance of five diversity indices and, on this basis, propose the creation of a more effective diversity average measure.

Mechanisms of B cell tolerance include deletion, anergy, developmental arrest, receptor editing, and B cell differentiation to the B-1 subtype. However, recent studies in our laboratory have suggested that B cell tolerance to the nuclear autoantigen La is limited in normal mice, and tolerance may reside primarily in the T cell compartment. To test this hypothesis, we created Ig transgenic mice expressing the IgM H chain from an mAb specific for a xenogeneic epitope within human La (hLa). These mice were bred with hLa-transgenic mice that constitutively express hLa in a manner comparable to endogenous mouse La. Between 5-15% of transgenic B cells developing in the absence of hLa were specific for hLa, and these cells were neither depleted nor developmentally arrested in the presence of endogenous hLa expression. Instead, these autoreactive B cells matured normally and differentiated into Ab-forming cells, capable of secreting high titer autoantibody. Additionally, the life span of autoreactive hLa-specific B cells was not reduced, and they were phenotypically and functionally indistinguishable from naive nonautoreactive hLa-specific B cells developing in the absence of hLa. Together these data suggest a lack of intrinsic B cell tolerance involving any known mechanisms indicating that these autoreactive B cells are indifferent to their autoantigen.","[0.0032601, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.06639768, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00252178]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Methods Nine manufacturers of EIA kits to detect antibodies of defined specificities participated in a study in which they received coded sera from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These coded sera contained different dilutions of antibody of one specificity mixed with sera containing antibodies of other specificities. The manufacturers were asked to use their standard technology to determine antibody content and send the data to a committee of the International Union of Immunological Societies for analysis. The data were analyzed for sensitivity and specificity in the detection of anti–double‐stranded DNA (anti‐dsDNA), anti–single‐stranded DNA, antihistone, anti‐Sm, anti–U1 RNP, anti‐SSA/Ro, anti‐SSB/La, anti–Scl‐70 (DNA topoisomerase I), anticentromere, and anti–Jo‐1 antibodies. In addition, replicate samples were included in the coded sera to evaluate the precision of each EIA method. Results Lack of sensitivity and specificity was most evident in the anti‐dsDNA and anti‐Sm kits, although 2 kits for anti‐dsDNA achieved acceptable sensitivity and specificity. Generally, anti‐SSA/Ro, anti‐SSB/La, anti–Scl‐70, anticentromere, and anti–Jo‐1 kits performed well. Many false‐positive results were obtained with a multiple myeloma serum containing cryoprecipitates, but multiple myeloma sera without cryoprecipitates presented no problem in the EIA system.

Twenty companies that were known major purveyors of EIA kits for detection of ANA were approached to determine their interest and willingness to participate in this study. The manufacturers were advised that they would be sent coded sera containing mixtures of the Arthritis Foundation/Centers for Disease Control reference reagents, and that they were to use their own test kits to analyze the antibody specificities of these sera and to report the data, in optical density (OD) units, or their equivalent. The analysts were blinded to the concentration of the antibodies and the specificities. Initially, 11 manufacturers out of 20 agreed to participate, but 2 subsequently withdrew. The commercial EIA kits have the potential of being able to quantitate specific autoantibody content to ds-DNA, SSB/La, Sm, and Scl-70. However, certain deficiencies in these kits were also detected, the most obvious being lack of uniformly good performance, with kits of certain manufacturers showing exceptional accuracy in 3 out of 4 of their antibody-specific kits and poor accuracy for a 4th kit. It is important for clinicians to appreciate that there is marked inter-manufacturer variation in the performance of EIA kits used as an aid in the diagnosis of systemic rheumatic diseases. Manufacturers need to exercise constant surveillance of kit performance and to provide assurance that such is being done.

Fifteen international laboratories experienced in performing tests for ANA by indirect immunofluorescence participated in analyzing coded sera from healthy individuals and from patients in the 5 different disease groups described above. Except for the stipulation that HEp-2 cells should be used as substrate, each laboratory used its own in-house methodology so that the data might be expected to reflect the output of a cross-section of worldwide ANA reference laboratories. The sera were analyzed at 4 dilutions: 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, and 1:320. In healthy individuals, the frequency of ANA did not differ significantly across the 4 age subgroups spanning 20-60 years of age. This putatively normal population was ANA positive in 31.7% of individuals at 1:40 serum dilution, 13.3% at 1:80, 5.0% at 1:160, and 3.3% at 1:320. In comparison with the findings among the disease groups, a low cutoff point at 1:40 serum dilution (high sensitivity, low specificity) could have diagnostic value, since it would classify virtually all patients with SLE, SSc, or SS as ANA positive. Conversely, a high positive cutoff at 1:160 serum dilution (high specificity, low sensitivity) would be useful to confirm the presence of disease in only a portion of cases, but would be likely to exclude 95% of normal individuals.

Furthermore, we draw a further distinction between one-off events and those that are cyclical in nature, with the latter being theorized using insights from studies of the television format industry.

These inequities are a significant public health issue, tracking forward to adverse health outcomes in adulthood. We examined the potential to reduce socioeconomic gaps in children's reading skills through increasing home reading and preschool attendance amongst disadvantaged children. Methods : We drew on data from the nationally representative birth cohort of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (N=5107) to examine the impact of socioeconomic disadvantage (0-1 year) on children's reading skills (8-9 years). An interventional effects approach was applied to estimate the extent to which improving the levels of home reading (2-5 years) and preschool attendance (4-5 years) of socioeconomically disadvantaged children to be commensurate with their advantaged peers, could potentially reduce socioeconomic gaps in children's reading skills. Results : Socioeconomically disadvantaged children had a higher risk of poor reading outcomes compared to more advantaged peers: absolute risk difference=20% (95% CI: 16.0% to 24.2%). Results suggest that improving disadvantaged children's home reading and preschool attendance to the level of their advantaged peers could eliminate 6.5% and 2.1% of socioeconomic gaps in reading skills, respectively. However, large socioeconomic gaps would remain, with disadvantaged children maintaining an 18.3% (95% CI: 14.0% to 22.7%) higher risk of poor reading outcomes in absolute terms.

In a country that practises parliamentary democracy but simultaneously observed close cooperation between the then ruling coalition and the mainstream press, this paper shows the micro-politics of the driving force of the coalition, United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) – specifically, how anxiety regarding the maintenance of their privileged and empowered Malay position dominated the national narrative during the GE13 campaign. Focusing on editorial journalistic genres in four paid-for Malay-language newspapers, I illustrate the typical politics of fear that characterises much of Malaysian right-wing rhetoric – the ways in which racial and religion issues are provoked. The in-depth representational analysis, via the Discourse-historical Approach’s (DHA) nomination and predication strategies, also suggests the normalisation of nationalistic and racist rhetoric, which primarily works with ‘fear’: fear of change, of loss of privilege, of the future, of other races; in principle, almost anything can be constructed as a threat to ‘Us’, an imagined homogenous people inside a well-protected territory through the discursive construction of such in-groups and out-groups.","[0.05687201, 0.0, 0.01557355, 0.01100454, 0.00162702, 0.0, 0.00240516, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00298641, 0.00134783, 0.00248551]",politics,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06

This longitudinal study is aimed at addressing the issue. It applied content analysis methodology, the use of four British national newspapers and a sample duration that spanned between 1992 and 2017. It uncovered that Western journalists consistently dominated the reportage of Africa without any exception throughout the sample period. Apart from Western journalists, other journalists or sources involved in the media coverage—African local journalists, Afro-Western journalists, joint journalists, and news agencies’ African reports were insignificantly used. Also, this study further revealed that the use of news agencies’ African reports had a continuous decline from 1997 to 2017. Therefore, the domination of the British press coverage of Africa over the years by Western journalists results in the portrayal of Africa from an imbalanced single prism of Westernised perspective, thereby resulting in the poor coverage of Africa and the spread of further ignorance of the continent to the global audience, which hampers both tourism and Western business investments to Africa. This study concludes that who reports Africa in the UK press is embedded in neo-colonialism, white hegemony, and inequality.","[0.02330644, 0.0, 0.02163792, 0.00739224, 0.0, 0.00014006, 0.01919723, 0.00450558, 0.02267103, 0.00271383, 0.0, 0.0]",politics,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

A tripartite mixed methodology of observation of assessment interviews, questionnaires with children in the Youth Justice System and youth justice practitioners, and focus groups with practitioners was implemented across three Youth Offending Teams in England and Wales. Analyses synergized methods from conversation analysis and corpus linguistics. Findings inform recommendations for refocusing youth justice assessment and staff training on facilitating children’s communicative engagement (that is, enhancing enablers and removing/minimizing barriers).

The application of new techniques over the last decade has been welcomed in some quarters as a means of disrupting an unpopular industry. In other quarters, disruption is seen as a threat to the solidaristic, risk-spreading principles underlying socialised and, to a lesser extent, privatised insurance models. If risk is to be determined by the behaviour of individuals rather than their membership of pools, this has far-reaching implications for how fairness and non-discrimination are defined and regulated in insurance practice. Yet public debate on the topic has been hampered by confusion over what is meant by ‘personalisation’ and by limited understanding of the role existing insurtech innovations play in assessing risk. To clarify these issues the paper reviews two recent and controversial cases– the use of self-tracking in ‘interactive’ health and life insurance and the use of customer-facing AI by Lemonade Inc. a non-life US based insurtech company.","[0.03022912, 0.00840145, 0.0161146, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.03032014, 0.0029568, 0.0, 0.00258818, 0.0157372, 0.00023777]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

The study suggests that CSR has promoted rural education in Tongcheng and Huaining through various channels, including foundations, local NGOs, government agencies and direct involvement. However, most CSR involvement is highly vulnerable, owing to the lack of institutionalization and formalization of CSR behaviour. Additionally, the inappropriate administrative practices of governments and unreliable channels of distribution of funds are impediments to CSR. The study demonstrates that CSR is a rapidly developing concept in China, with strong untapped potential to improve rural education if current obstacles can be removed.","[0.0323242, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.06141694, 0.00676489, 0.00038482, 0.0211134, 0.0, 0.01272857, 0.0]",education,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06

There is a dearth of evidence from MENA on antiretroviral therapy engagement. In this qualitative study, we sought to identify the ways in which successful treatment is hindered in Iran, which is home to 24% of HIV infections in MENA. Methods From August 2018 to January 2019, we used purposive sampling and conducted 12 individual interviews and 8 focus group discussions with 27 female and 31 male patients, in addition to 5 individual interviews with HIV care providers and 1 focus group discussion with 8 care providers. Social constructivism augmented with realist-informed thematic analysis was used to understand how the socioecological context triggers cognitive and affective mechanisms that disrupt antiretroviral therapy. Results The use of Thematic Network Analysis resulted in the identification of three key cognitive and affective mechanisms that appear to shape treatment experience and are triggered via HIV’s socioecological context and changing economic conditions in Iran: denial in response to societal negative perceptions of HIV; fear in response to societal lack of awareness regarding HIV and misinformation; and despair in response to HIV-related stigma and enacted discrimination, economic insecurity and social support. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study within MENA to identify pathways through which successful treatment is hindered. It appears that lack of societal awareness regarding HIV is specific to low prevalence settings, such as MENA countries, where nega

Yet the strict dependence of viruses on cells for their multiplication has been widely acknowledged since the first decades of the 20th century. How could viruses play critical roles in the OL if life relies on cellular organization and if viruses are defined as parasites of cells? In other words, how could viruses play a role in the emergence of cellular life if the existence of cells is a prerequisite for the existence of viruses? This paper investigates this issue and describes past and current OL scenarios conferring viruses with important roles, thereby completing the work of historian of science and physician Scott Podolsky who identified three major roles of viruses in past OL scenarios. Some objections raised by present OL scenarios conferring viruses with an important role are discussed. I argue that disagreements concerning the roles of viruses in OL scenarios stem from the different concepts of life and of virus scientists defend. Investigating the roles of viruses in OL scenarios not only helps identifying different ways to define life in the context of OL theorizing. It also offers the opportunity to better understand how viruses could be conceptualized.

Discovered in 1920, the phenomenon was first wielded by its discoverers as a challenge to the idea that bacteriophages might be autonomous infectious agents of exogenous origin, namely viruses. But by the 1950s, lysogeny had come to be understood as a key mechanism through which some bacteriophages interacted with their bacterial hosts. In this paper we consider the history of the status of bacteriophage lysogeny from obstacle to lynchpin in conceiving of viruses, paying particular attention to the contributions of Eugène and Élisabeth Wollman, Macfarlane Burnet and André Lwoff in effecting this transition. As Lwoff is often acknowledged to be the author of the ‘modern’ virus concept, this paper also retraces the precise experimental, theoretical and technical pathways that led him and his collaborators from their studies of lysogeny to the construction of the said concept. We discuss Lwoff's virus concept and the widening impact of his ideas, with special consideration of how lysogeny helped revolutionise the understanding virus–host-cell relationships in tumour viruses.","[0.0353565023, 0.000894684003, 0.00877790706, 0.0, 0.0, 5.55402572e-05, 0.00172460364, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00298544773]",politics,"[9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

But is there more at play in insurance architecture than promotional strategy and if architecture has a promotional role, who are the targeted audiences? This paper explores the changing relationship between insurance buildings, insurance brands, and capital and property investment strategies. It considers how the business of property investment propelled the work of big insurers in shaping urban environments through the twentieth century and traces how that began to change as the century closed. The ascendance of the tech industries and the emergence of ‘insurtech’ has been accompanied by a change in the role architecture plays in insurance. Architecture, and interior design, still play a central role in branding but insurtech start-ups, and the insurtech branches of legacy insurers, use it to convey lightness, agility, creativity and informality. These changes line up with a signature big tech aesthetic – more valley, less city – that is designed to evoke innovation and disruption.

This study aimed to identify interventions and circumstances associated with three or more targets (“accelerators”) within multiple SDGs relating to HIV-affected adolescents and examine cumulative effects on outcomes. Methods Prospective longitudinal data from 3401 adolescents from randomly selected census enumeration areas in two provinces with > 30% HIV prevalence carried out in 2010/11 and 2011/12 were used to examine six hypothesized accelerators (positive parenting, parental monitoring, free schooling, teacher support, food sufficiency and HIV-negative/asymptomatic caregiver) targeting twelve outcomes across four SDGs, using a multivariate (multiple outcome) path model with correlated outcomes controlling for outcome at baseline and socio-demographics. The study corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing and tested measurement invariance across sex. Percentage predicted probabilities of occurrence of the outcome in the presence of the significant accelerators were also calculated. Results Sample mean age was 13.7 years at baseline, 56.6% were female. Positive parenting, parental monitoring, food sufficiency and AIDS-free caregiver were variously associated with reductions on ten outcomes. The model was gender invariant.

It explores the possibilities of using rapid diagnostic tests to improve animal health management and treatment, particularly in situations where laboratory veterinary infrastructure is limited. Using data from a survey undertaken in 2018, three composite variables, i.e. perceived usefulness, compatibility with existing practices and ease of use, derived from the Model of Technological Acceptance and Diffusion Innovation Theory are used to analyse the perceived characteristics and values of rapid diagnostic test devices for farmers. Results suggest smallholder farmers’ willingness to adopt and use the tests provided they are affordable, easy to use and suitable to their local conditions – a common referential being mobile phones. While such tests have the potential to improve how antibiotics are used in smallholder farms, they are more likely to instigate more general improvements in how treatment decisions are made without necessarily reducing unnecessary antimicrobial use. The adoption may also imply a diminishing need for traditional veterinary services, thus making farmers more self-sufficient in animal health care. Farmers also seem to be more concerned by false negatives leading to sick animals missing vital treatment than by false positives where drugs will be administered to healthy animals. Overall promoting rapid diagnostic test technologies inevitably calls for new controls and regulations.","[0.01175964, 0.01625399, 0.01247719, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.06631582, 0.0, 0.00979904, 0.00459155, 0.0452674, 0.00879502]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

We pose questions about the processes which construct and reaffirm the theory/area distinction in IR and show that the binary creates structural pressures and reinscribes hierarchies for individual scholars. We notice that IR’s Euro/West-centrism is directly linked to and perpetuated by the divide that privileges IR theorising over empirical research both on and from places outside of the West. We show how this divide has been institutionalised with the effect of producing separate but intertwined academic fields of ‘IR’ and ‘Area Studies’. The hitherto voiced calls to overcome the divide have largely focused on the question of how to give more weight to knowledge produced about the ‘non-West’ in IR. This, we argue, overlooks the broader significance of the theory/area divide, which lies in the socio-instructional structures maintaining it and the concrete effects they have on researchers from the ‘peripheries’. This article, therefore, aims to examine the construction of Area Studies’ peripherality and to rethink possible solutions.

The aim of this article is one of theory generating, using the cases of Donald Trump and Greta Thunberg to illustrate the idea of populism as story-telling.

Here, we demonstrate that rapid activation of protein synthesis is a unique, and previously uncharacterized, feature of the injury response critical for limb regeneration in the axolotl (A. mexicanum). By applying polysome sequencing, we identify hundreds of transcripts, including antioxidants and ribosome components, which do not change in their overall mRNA abundance but are selectively activated at the level of translation from pre-existing mRNAs in response to injury. In contrast, we show that protein synthesis is not activated in response to digit amputation in the non-regenerative mouse. We further identify the mTORC1 pathway as a key upstream signal that mediates this regenerative translation response in the axolotl. Inhibition of this pathway is sufficient to suppress translation and axolotl regeneration. Surprisingly, although mTOR is highly evolutionarily conserved, we discover unappreciated expansions in mTOR protein sequence among urodele amphibians. By engineering an axolotl mTOR in human cells, we demonstrate that this change creates a hypersensitive kinase that may allow axolotls to maintain this pathway in a highly labile state primed for rapid activation. This may underlie metabolic differences and nutrient sensing between regenerative and non-regenerative species that are key to regeneration. Together, these findings highlight the unanticipated impact of the translatome on orchestrating the early steps of wound healing in highly regenerative species and provide a missing link in our understanding of vertebrate reg

First, we retrieved all sequence submission data from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), including accession numbers associated with each species. Second, we used these accession numbers to construct queries to retrieve peer-reviewed scientific publications that first linked to these sequence lengths in the scientific literature. For each species, this resulted in two associated datasets: 1) A .csv file documenting the PMID of each article describing new sequences, all paper authors, all institutional affiliations of each author, countries of institution, year of first submission to the ENA, and the year of article publication, and 2) A .csv file documenting all institutions submitting to the ENA, number of nucleotides sequenced, number of submissions per institution in a given year, and years of submission to the database. In several upcoming publications, we utilise these datasets to understand how institutional collaboration shaped sequencing efforts, and to systematically identify important institutions and changes in network structures over time.

Paul et al.

By citation context and network analysis of 343 citing papers, I show how Paul et al. was cited in the twenty years after its publication. Generally, different findings were cited by different communities focussing on different risk-factors; communities established by either research foci title terms or via cluster membership as established via modularity maximisation. The most frequently cited findings were the significant associations between heart disease; and serum cholesterol (n=85), blood pressure (n=57), and coffee consumption (n=54). The lack of association between diet and heart disease was cited in just 41 papers. Yet, no single empirical finding was referred to in more than 25% of the citing papers.

Mindfulness practices are beginning to be integrated into social work curricula globally to enhance student self-care along with key social work practice skills and values. This mixed methods study examined the effects of a bespoke six-week online mindfulness-based social work and self-care (MBSWSC) programme on the stress, burnout, well-being, anxiety and depression levels of thirty social work students from two universities in the UK. This study also examined the effects of MBSWSC on a number of mindfulness-based mediators of change in these outcomes. Participant perceptions of the benefits of the MBSWSC programme on their well-being and social work practice are further explored via a thematic analysis of an open-ended questionnaire. Statistically significant changes in all variables were found post-programme except for depression and loss of empathy/depersonalisation, a facet of burnout.

Little is known about the roles of habitus, capital, and social topographies in shaping under-age access to tobacco. This article draws on Bourdieu's theory of practice and data generated from 56 focus groups with 14- to 19-year-olds across seven European cities to answer the question ""via what sources and by what means do adolescents obtain tobacco?"" We find that adolescents use a range of personal capitals (social, cultural, and economic) to access tobacco, with the specific constitution and deployment of these capitals varying according to the regularities of different fields. Since adolescents access tobacco via culturally embedded practices, attempts to curtail this access are more likely to be effective if they are multi-pronged, culturally informed, and attuned to the lived experiences of adolescent smokers.","[0.0174329, 0.00207887, 0.0, 0.00140618, 0.00847135, 0.04755678, 0.04484693, 0.0, 0.0127564, 0.00155238, 0.02471954, 0.00305586]",education,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

The distinctiveness of this new book, resides in bringing together canonical sociological figures in a text that is designed to tackle fundamental questions about the social character of ordered and extremely disordered conduct, and which is aimed primarily at undergraduates. The book offers an innovative perspective on how individual behavior is socially patterned. It draws in part on the massive recent explosion of self-help manuals, television shows, and internet sites designed to produce and sanction particular forms of behavior. It also taps into the enduring fascination with situations in which extreme and violent conduct is widespread.

Systems-level analysis of how flaviviruses hijack cellular processes through virus-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs) provides information about their replication and pathogenic mechanisms. We used affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to compare flavivirus-host interactions for two viruses (DENV and ZIKV) in two hosts (human and mosquito). Conserved virus-host PPIs revealed that the flavivirus NS5 protein suppresses interferon stimulated genes by inhibiting recruitment of the transcription complex PAF1C and that chemical modulation of SEC61 inhibits DENV and ZIKV replication in human and mosquito cells. Finally, we identified a ZIKV-specific interaction between NS4A and ANKLE2, a gene linked to hereditary microcephaly, and showed that ZIKV NS4A causes microcephaly in Drosophila in an ANKLE2-dependent manner. Thus, comparative flavivirus-host PPI mapping provides biological insights and, when coupled with in vivo models, can be used to unravel pathogenic mechanisms.

Surprisingly, both loss of p53, which is activated by RP haploinsufficiency, and augmented protein synthesis rescue these phenotypes. These findings are explained by the finding that p53 functions as a master regulator of protein synthesis, at least in part, through transcriptional activation of 4E-BP1. 4E-BP1, a key translational regulator, in turn, facilitates selective changes in the translatome downstream of p53, and this thereby explains how RP haploinsufficiency may elicit specificity to gene expression.

A CBA approach seeks to speak with participants, not for them. They learned about the research process, why research is needed, and how we can produce it together. Using a critical-hope framework, that is, a pedagogical tool that uses a critical theory lens to address unjust systems through meaningful dialogue and empathic responses, we co-led 30 psychosocial peace-building education (PBBE) courses in Kakuma and Nairobi, Kenya. Data were collected from the researcher and co-researchers’ reflective logs on our own observations in the PBBE courses.

There has been very limited previous research comparing approaches to MHSW in Europe and so the aim of the study was to develop a better understanding of the similarities and differences between and, where relevant, within countries (referred to as jurisdictions). An online survey was distributed mainly through existing European networks and social media to seek information on the role, nature, extent and context of MHSW in a range of European jurisdictions. Conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, there were 158 responses from 10 jurisdictions. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. From this analysis, four main themes were identified, relating to: role; law, policy and education; the distinctive contribution made by MHSW; and the key challenges for MHSW. The study demonstrates that MHSW, although it is described and provided in different ways and is confined by a range of factors, plays an important role in mental health services across jurisdictions. There are also interesting differences between contexts, especially in the balance of therapeutic, legal and specialist/generic approaches, some of which reflect the World Health Organisation’s vision and objectives for mental health. Lastly, the study illustrates a need and provides a valuable basis for further comparative and collaborative work to define MHSW and enhance the contributions it makes.","[0.0300545796, 0.0, 0.115406157, 0.0, 2.03204552e-05, 0.014091618, 0.0, 0.0014998634, 0.0, 0.0137940832, 0.0454874668, 0.00241455205]",covid,"[1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01

Annual vaccination of at least 70% of dogs has been shown to eliminate rabies in both human and canine populations. However, delivery of large-scale mass dog vaccination campaigns remains a challenge in many rabies-endemic countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, where the vast majority of dogs are owned, mass vaccination campaigns have typically depended on a combination of static point (SP) and door-to-door (D2D) approaches since SP-only campaigns often fail to achieve 70% vaccination coverage. However, D2D approaches are expensive, labor-intensive, and logistically challenging, raising the need to develop approaches that increase attendance at SPs. Here, we report a real-time, data-driven approach to improve efficiency of an urban dog vaccination campaign. Historically, we vaccinated ∼35,000 dogs in Blantyre city, Malawi, every year over a 20-d period each year using combined fixed SP (FSP) and D2D approaches. To enhance cost effectiveness, we used our historical vaccination dataset to define the barriers to FSP attendance. Guided by these insights, we redesigned our vaccination campaign by increasing the number of FSPs and eliminating the expensive and labor-intensive D2D component. Combined with roaming SPs, whose locations were defined through the real-time analysis of vaccination coverage data, this approach resulted in the vaccination of near-identical numbers of dogs in only 11 d. This approach has the potential to act as a template for successful and sustainable future urban SP-only dog vaccination campaigns.","[0.02023103, 0.0, 0.00494968, 0.0, 0.00959999, 0.0, 0.0512538, 0.0, 0.00190459, 0.0, 0.01340382, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

The vast majority of human rabies cases are attributable to bites from infected domestic dogs and consequently control of rabies in the dog population through mass vaccination campaigns is considered the most effective method of eliminating the disease. Achieving the WHO target of 70% vaccination coverage has proven challenging in low-resource settings such as Sub Saharan Africa, and lack of public awareness about rabies vaccination campaigns is a major barrier to their success. In this study we surveyed communities in three districts in Southern Malawi to assess the extent of and socio-economic factors associated with mobile phone ownership and explore the attitudes of communities towards the use of short message service (SMS) to inform them of upcoming rabies vaccination clinics. Methods: This study was carried out between 1 October-3 December 2018 during the post-vaccination assessment of the annual dog rabies campaign in Blantyre, Zomba and Chiradzulu districts, Malawi. 1882 questionnaires were administered to households in 90 vaccination zones. The surveys gathered data on mobile phone ownership and use, and barriers to mobile phone access. A multivariable regression model was used to understand factors related to mobile phone ownership. Results: Most survey respondents owned or had use of a mobile phone, however there was evidence of an inequality of access, with higher education level, living in Blantyre district and being male positively associated with mobile phone ownership.

Adopting more restrictive policies is a possible way forward, but this is likely to lead to electorally costly intra-party conflict. This article illuminates the conditions under which social democratic parties can unite behind more restrictive immigration policies and promote them consistently. Employing a most-similar systems design, it presents a comparative case study of the Austrian and Danish social democrats, from the 2015 ‘refugee crisis’ to 2020. The article argues that low levels of territorial decentralisation enabled the Danish social democrats to promote a restrictive stance on immigration top-down, while the Austrian social democrats’ federal party structure exacerbated internal disagreements between urban and rural leaders. These findings highlight the importance of internal party characteristics in explaining how parties respond to strategic trade-offs.

Empirical evidence routinely indicates that jurors change their minds throughout the process. What is less clear is when and why this occurs and whether the causes are consistent across juries that consider the same topic but are situated within different contexts. We present evidence of opinion change in citizens’ juries through a natural experiment, contrasting three local contexts of onshore windfarm development in Scotland; viz. existing, planned, and absent. Jurors’ individual opinions of climate change, wind energy, and windfarms were measured through questionnaires at four time points: the start, following information-giving, reflection, and deliberation. Statistical examination of jurors’ responses, through paired sample t-tests, Wilcoxon sign-tests, and Generalised Least Squares regression, reveals to what extent substantive changes were associated with different phases and locational contexts. In all three juries, opinion change occurs throughout the process, on different topics, and to different degrees. While the information phase consistently influences jurors’ opinions the most, jury composition affects the magnitude and direction of opinion change, with outcomes contingent on contexts. Our findings are important for informing how mini-publics are designed and used to inform environmental policy-making at different scales.","[0.04174154, 0.00313545, 0.00923164, 0.0, 0.06726826, 0.0, 0.0405937, 0.00391942, 0.0, 0.00592462, 0.0, 0.0]",politics,"[1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Alcohol and drug use have increased during recent decades in many low- and middle-income countries, with South Africa, where this study was conducted, having among the highest rates in the world. Despite existing evidence on the effectiveness of family-based interventions in reducing substance use among parents and caregivers in low- and middle-income countries, little is known about the mechanism of change that contributes to the reduction. This study investigated mediators of change in a parenting programme (Parenting for Lifelong Health [PLH]) on reducing substance use among parents and caregivers of adolescents through three potential mediators: parental depression, parenting stress and family poverty. Methods The current study used a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial design. The total sample comprised 552 parent and caregiver of adolescents M = 49.37(SD = 14.69) who were recruited from 40 communities in South Africa’s Eastern Cape. Participants completed a structured confidential self-report questionnaire at baseline and a follow-up test 5 to 9 months after the intervention. Structural equation modeling was conducted to investigate direct and indirect effects. Results Analyses indicated that the effect of the PLH intervention on reducing parental substance use was mediated in one indirect pathway: improvement in parental mental health (reduction in parental depression levels). No mediation pathways from the PLH intervention on parental substance use could be associated with parenting stress or family poverty.

This article explores the practical and theoretical dilemmas posed for academic feminists who enter such positions in the age of the rise of the ‘neoliberal academy’. These are familiar dilemmas for feminist bureaucrats – femocrats – working inside political, governmental, judicial and economic institutions but have been less explored with respect to the academy. What can academic feminists do when they take on middle or senior management roles? How do they experience being simultaneously the embodiment of institutional authority (to manage, regulate, quantify, monetise) as managers, as well as a source of oppositional knowledge as feminists? To what extent are there opportunities to work with the grain of an institution to challenge the gendered status quo from within? Or are academic feminists who manage inevitably co-opted and compromised?

It is a pre-emptive intervention, especially targeted at structurally weak economies with rising Euroscepticism, to avoid costly ex-post bailouts as in the Great Recession. We demonstrate, using quantitative analysis, that pre-existing vulnerabilities, rather than the impact of the pandemic, drove the allocation of NGEU resources: per capita grants largely correspond to past economic vulnerabilities, as well as to political ones. Countries most vulnerable to another adjustment by austerity after the Covid-19 economic crisis receive most resources. Also, countries with strong anti-EU sentiments are entitled to larger NGEU grants per capita. In contrast, grants are not correlated with the severity of the health crisis. Then we show the domestic relevance of economic and political vulnerabilities through qualitative case studies of national political debates and domestic positions on NGEU in Italy, Germany and the Netherlands. Despite its innovative traits, NGEU is a politically constrained solution to address the mess from the previous decade, and as such, it is a Janus solution: promising a fresh start, but haunted by the past.","[0.05445248, 0.0, 0.06544958, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00547637, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01078994]",covid,"[9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

We aimed to investigate long-term outcomes of the adalimumab (ADA) biosimilar SB5 in IBD patients following a switch from the ADA originator (SB5-switch cohort) or after start of SB5 (SB5-start cohort). Methods: We performed an observational cohort study in a tertiary IBD referral centre. All IBD patients treated with Humira® underwent an elective switch to SB5. We identified all these patients in a biologic prescription database that prospectively registered all ADA start and stop dates including brand names. Data on IBD phenotype, CRP, drug persistence, ADA drug and antibody levels, and faecal calprotectin were collected. Results: 481 patients were treated with SB5, 256 in the SB5-switch cohort (median follow-up: 13.7 months [8.6-15.2]) and 225 in the SB5-start cohort (median follow-up: 8.3 months [4.2-12.8]). 70.8% of the SB5-switch cohort remained on SB5 beyond one year; 90/256 discontinued SB5, mainly due to adverse events (46/90) or secondary loss of response (37/90). In the SB5-start cohort, 81/225 discontinued SB5 resulting in SB5-drug persistence of 60.3% beyond one year. No differences in clinical remission (p=0.53), CRP (p=0.80), faecal calprotectin (p=0.40) and ADA trough levels (p=0.55) were found between baseline, week 26 and week 52 following switch.

Participants and setting A total of 1,189 mother-infant dyads residing in eight diverse low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) were recruited. Methods Latent class analysis using the Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars (BCH) 3-step method with auxiliary multilevel logistic regressions with distal outcomes were performed. Results The LCA identified three high-risk classes and one low-risk class, namely: (1) highly maltreated (7%, n = 89), (2) emotionally and physically abused with intra-familial violence exposure (13%, n = 152), (3), emotionally abused (40%, n = 474), and (4) low household dysfunction and abuse (40%, n = 474). Overall, across all latent classes, there were low probabilities of prenatal substance use and poor infant outcomes. However, pairwise comparisons between classes indicate that class 1 and 3 had higher probabilities of prenatal illicit drug use compared to class 4. Additionally, class 2 had higher probability of low birth weight compared to the three remaining classes. Conclusion The results further our understanding of the dynamic and multifaceted nature of ACEs.

Using a meta-ethnographic approach, we identified a spectrum of descriptive and injunctive norms of vaping across the themes of addiction; perceptions of comparative harm; parental perceptions and peer perceptions. We found addiction and perceptions of comparative harm to reflect descriptive norms, while we found clearer evidence explaining the use and non-use of e-cigarettes through parental and peer approval of vaping.

On this basis, first we show that new instruments—the Six-Pack, Fiscal Compact and Two-Pack—have been layered onto the existing institutional framework governing the European Monetary Union (EMU). Furthermore, we show that the instruments strengthening budgetary discipline to improve the functioning of the EMU have become more explicit in terms of policy objectives, particularly specifying new benchmarks to obtain fiscal discipline. They are also stricter in terms of surveillance and enforcement. Secondly, we show that there are initiatives to address and improve the social dimension of the EU—Europe 2020, the Social Investment Package and the Youth Guarantee—and that these have also emerged through a process of institutional layering.

The Guide tells people about their legal rights, but it also symbolises a mid-twentieth-century enthusiasm for the welfare state. Making a model of the Guide for a socio-legal workshop helped to consider the physicality of the booklet and to think about how it might have been received by its readers. This article explores the meaning of the booklet, considering its form and its content but also its reception by the public. A survey conducted in 1948 concluded that the Guide had been unsuccessful in reaching those who could most benefit from it, particularly women. This article uses the findings of this survey to consider the booklet as a piece of public legal information and the role of legal consciousness in legal information provision.","[0.02769527, 0.00574989, 0.00378143, 0.03525182, 0.00809842, 0.00101677, 0.0, 0.01271144, 0.00038902, 0.00741588, 0.01918798, 0.00990649]",women,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

There was regional variation in the status of migrants prior to migrating, motivations for migration, remittance transfer options, proportion of migrants engaged in internal and external migration, and gender dynamics. Equally, for natural resource management use and risk, results also varied regionally.

Besides a public health crisis, Brazil has been facing a political crisis. In less than two months, two health ministers resigned under a president who publicly discredits science. Numbers of contaminations and deaths show an exponential growth day by day, having already passed the glooming mark of 9 million cases and 230 thousand deaths. As Tedros Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), alerted for an “infodemic”, predicting the viral spread of misleading content about coronavirus in a pandemic scenario, we argue that covid-19 disinformation becomes a useful political tool, particularly for the far-right. Information plays a crucial role in decision-making processes and ways of living, alongside political positioning. Preliminary research in this area suggests a relation between misleading content and news cases of the disease (Singha et al., 2020; Moreno et al., 2020). This paper aims to map the flow of disinformation related to the pandemic in Brazil and discuss its main themes, examining possible connections with political issues and actors in the country. We employed a quantitative approach to publications that circulated on social media in 2020. First, we constructed a sample of 255 high engagement disinformation pieces using document analysis (Bowen, 2009). The previously stored material was accessed through the reports from the Brazilian leading fact-checking agency Aos Fatos. Then, we conducted a content analysis of the original disinformation pieces. Categories and variables were built by inductive-deductive method (Elo & Kyngas, 2018; Mayring, 2000). Our find

However, despite decades of research on RDTs and a relatively permissive regulatory environment in the UK, few devices are in commercial use. Challenges discussed by RDT developers included identifying commercially-viable targets, and management of the innovation ecosystem, e.g. to create clear pathways to market supporting positive interactions between farmers, vets, and other actors along the value chain. Future support for RDT development could be provided through incorporation in: assured food systems; business service packages provided by centralised laboratories; or animal health monitoring packages related to the spread of AMR. Breeding stock sales could require an accompanying health package including RDTs, vaccines and/or antibiotics, linking to precision agriculture approaches. Unlike the example of RDT development for COVID-19, it seems that the urgency of the issue and the clarity of links between animal and human health outcomes are not yet sufficient to support a fast-tracking programme for the development of RDTs to combat AMR.","[0.0112788894, 0.0157082724, 0.0646231426, 0.0, 0.00496074053, 0.0, 0.0106854443, 2.34420537e-05, 0.0392111445, 0.0, 0.0360612657, 0.0]",covid,"[5.77981385e-05 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

In Europe those concerns grew after reporting of disinformation campaigns in the Brexit (Cadwalladr, 2017), Cataluña (Marino et. al, 2019) and French elections (Chesney & Citron, 2019). Since then, interference of “fake news” in the political discourse has been thoroughly analysed (Fletcher et al., 2018; Jack, 2017; Bennett & Livingstone, 2018). Research that covers disinformation with an anti-European discourse focuses mostly on possible Russian interference, Twitter and big data sets (Golovchenko, et. al., 2018; Gorrell et. al., 2019, Pierri et. al., 2019) and there is not a lot of understanding about how anti-EU online communities interact, share and produce disinformation. More importantly, the current project tried to demonstrate the relevance of adapting methodologies to study not only disinformation but digital phenomena in general in an closed API environment (Bruns, 2019; Perriam et. al., 2019). The more hands-on approach of manually fact-checking, categorizing and analysing a smaller number of posts in an ever more closed platform like Facebook contradicts general research focusing on AI, big data, Twitter-based data collection and analysis. However, as translated in this current report and previous findings using the same methodology (Cardoso et. al. 2019), it contributes with valid issues for the knowledge base. https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/WinterSchool2020DisinformationEU#A_1","[0.04663776, 0.0, 0.01318298, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01592208, 0.00495218, 0.0, 0.00446127, 0.00407088, 0.0, 0.00064773]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

A closer review of the EU’s health governance, however, reveals it to have performed exactly as expected and intended. An initial phase of disorganization and national egotism, unavoidable given that member states have historically restricted the EU’s health capacities, has been followed by a substantial new health policy agenda and a reinforcement of the EU’s market- and fiscal-based health influence.

First, the literature of comparative political economy on the multi-dimensionality of welfare politics can contribute to a clearer understanding of both the welfare-related causes and consequences of radical right support.

Less-invasive and cost-effective field procedures have become top-priority tomitigate the destructive effects on our cultural heritage from intensified land use, climatechange and the current conflict panorama. At a time when many organisations are investing in advanced geophysical equipment, amajor problem is that our ability to fully interpret the information available from geophysical datasets is still very limited. This deficiency prevents geophysical survey moving beyond basic prospection and becoming a significant tool for answering nuanced questions about archaeology and their host landscapes. This limitation arises from an incomplete understanding of the relationship between soil properties and geophysical measurements. Bridging this gap requires multi-disciplinary teams, testing novel methods, plus scholarly discussion to collate the outcomes of projects on this topic. Overcoming these challenges is a prerequisite for maximising the costeffectiveness of geophysical methods, realising the expected benefits of technological investment and allowing broader utility of geophysical methods in the cultural heritage sector.

To address all these problems simultaneously, we propose a novel graph neural network FDGATII, inspired by attention mechanism's ability to focus on selective information supplemented with two feature preserving mechanisms. FDGATII combines Initial Residuals and Identity Mapping with the more expressive dynamic self-attention to handle noise prevalent from the neighbourhoods in heterophilic data sets. By using sparse dynamic attention, FDGATII is inherently parallelizable in design, whist efficient in operation; thus theoretically able to scale to arbitrary graphs with ease. Our approach has been extensively evaluated on 7 datasets.

We analysed the mollusc remains from late prehistoric windward and leeward coastal midden sites from Moloka'i, Hawaiian Islands, to understand exploitation strategies in differing environmental contexts. Analysis of molluscan remains and their associated habitats, through a patch-choice framework, indicated that, instead of practicing different foraging regimes relative to their location, windward and leeward groups targeted small Neritidae gastropods from habitats adjacent to their home site. Despite the broad environmental differences, similar subsistence strategies may have been adopted for multiple reasons. In our windward-leeward assemblages, we suggest that mollusc size is not the paramount driver of forager decision making. Through a foraging theory lens, mollusc rank is reinterpreted beyond body size in response to prey-specific biological and ecological factors, such as aggregation and predictability. We also consider that targeted exploitation of stable, reliable, and resilient prey populations may instead be indicative of a risk management strategy in marginal, high variance environments. The best explanation may be a combination of both interpretations where the risk sensitive forager ranks prey by a different set of optimality criteria that includes targeting high-density clusters of small gastropods.","[0.0254107477, 0.00303440037, 0.0, 0.00118371095, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0564948696, 4.0996756e-05, 0.00232410841, 0.00177800537, 0.0, 0.00557887239]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

By 2000 and popularity of web 1.0, we started the new decade of web 2.0 and social web. All these evolutions in information technology have had inevitable effect on medical information systems. 2010 and the current decade is the time for web 3.0 and semantics. Effective pass through web 3.0 will, hopefully, guide us toward web 4.0; we can call it intelligent web and subsequently intelligent medical information systems. The basic components of semantics are ontology and the knowledgebase that support the required interactions. Ontology includes lexicon and a wide variety of relationships between concepts. Internationally accepted standard ontology will be an important achievement in launching global semantics for information system. This is an ongoing project with a well-known product in medicine called “SNOMED-CT” from International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization. Around this ontological core there are different knowledgebase standards and technologies for implementation. Knowledge engineers and informaticians have different challenges in this area. There’s a wide held belief that almost all of medical data will be managed in medical information systems in less than a decade, as we can find it out in the health care provider centers around many developed and developing countries, but the next challenge will be optimum usage of this huge repository of information for the best health-care services, education and research. Although already semantics has been utilized in different levels in various electronic medical records, we have long way to use it as an applied part of our e-health system. There is a need for a gen

Bone surface modifications (BSM) are used to infer past lifeways and behaviours through site formation processes, subsistence patterns and adaptations and how they influenced human evolution, as well as patterns of economic and social evolutions. The study of BSM first appeared in palaeontology in the mid-19th Century, before gaining traction in archaeology during the processual boom of the 1960s. By identifying BSM from ethnographic studies of BSM created by people in the present day and comparing them to marks found in the archaeological record, archaeologists were able to tie traces to specific bone modifying actions (e.g. Binford 1978; Brain 1981; White 1954). However, traces left by non-human modifiers can mimic those produced by humans (e.g. Blumenschine et al. 1996; Olsen and Shipman 1988; Selvaggio 1994a; Shipman and Rose 1984). Experimental taphonomic studies in zooarchaeology have been largely conducted with the goal of confidently tying traces to known actors and effectors (Gifford-Gonzalez 1989b, 1991). However, variation in experimental design, experimental bone subjects, and how the resultant BSM are classified and analysed has contributed to a lack of consensus between researchers. For example, cut marked bones found in deposits dating to 3.39 million-years-ago (Ma) challenged the current paradigm that butchery, meat-eating behaviours and, subsequently, stone tool use were present in pre-Homo hominins (Domínguez-Rodrigo et al. 2011; McPherron et al. 2011).

We both work on practices of care and control related to seeds, from seed banking and agricultural development projects to everyday practices of keeping, saving, and tinkering with seeds. As a term, seed evokes gendered ideas about human reproduction that center masculinity and virility, even though the botanical seeds are in fact already‐fertilized embryos. This entry takes up the gendered dimension of seeds (and the elisions it produces) as a lens to interrogate ideas of use, usefulness, and uselessness (Ahmed 2019) in the world of biodiversity banking and plant genetic resources. With examples from seed banking and farming in West Africa, and with inspiration from feminist philosophers and anthropologists Sylvia Wynter, Marilyn Strathern, and Sara Ahmed, this provocation contributes to the vocabularies of feminist anthropology and science studies.

Notably, in the NP, a PROCR ⁺ resident progenitor population showed enriched colony-forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) activity and trilineage differentiation capacity. Finally, intercellular crosstalk based on signaling network analysis uncovered that the PDGF and TGF-β cascades are important cues in the NP microenvironment. In conclusion, a single-cell transcriptomic atlas that resolves spatially regulated cellular heterogeneity together with the critical signaling that underlies homeostasis will help to establish new therapeutic strategies for IVD degeneration in the clinic.","[0.00929653, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00060111, 0.0, 0.05972822, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01026681, 0.00494761]",health_medicine,"[9.9999900e-01 1.0000000e-06 1.0000000e-06 1.0000000e-06 1.0000000e-06

This unique characteristic, expressed during bone development, maintenance and injury (fracture) healing, is performed by the reparative cells including skeletal stem cells (SSCs) and their descendants.

Moreover, for many years, there has been a biased view that bone marrow is the main cell source for bone repair. Together, these limitations have greatly hampered our understanding of these important cell populations and their potential applications in the treatment of fractures and skeletal diseases. Here, we reanalyse and summarize current understanding of the reparative cells in bone regeneration and repair and outline recent progress in this area, with a particular emphasis on the temporal and spatial process of fracture healing, the sources of reparative cells, an updated definition of SSCs, and markers of skeletal stem/progenitor cells contributing to the repair of craniofacial and long bones, as well as the debate between SSCs and pericytes.

However, existing studies tend towards high‐level comparisons of crime versus total aggregate welfare spend, overlooking sub‐national contextual differences between and within countries. There are also few studies that deeply explore this link in the Antipodes, including in Australia: a settler colony and (neo)liberal welfare state with a recent strong coupling of punitive social and penal policies that disproportionately impact Indigenous populations. This paper attends to these gaps by examining the welfare‐crime link in remote Indigenous Queensland (Australia). We use crime‐report data and an interrupted time series design to explore the effects of dynamic social welfare policies during 2020–2021: a period that saw a temporary shift away from a strict neoliberal welfare model (i.e., heavy conditionality, low benefit rates) to more supportive and decommodifying social welfare in response to the COVID‐19 induced economic recession. Our findings align with previous studies that suggest more supportive and decommodifying policies are associated with lower crime. We also bring greater nuance to how the crime‐welfare link is understood within the ‘structural complexity of [Australian] settler colonialism’ (Wolfe. Journal of Genocide Research. 2006;8:392), by illuminating how a politics of race animates social policies that can either produce or reduce criminogenic strains and, thus, socially construct crime in the image of the Indigenous ‘Other’.","[0.03007, 0.0, 0.02557498, 0.0286615, 0.00912163, 0.0, 0.015719, 0.00380313, 0.01027594, 0.09232083, 0.00889483, 0.01375177]",criminology,"[9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 3.51402228e-05

Malaysia is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention or its related 1967 Protocol and therefore does not provide legal recognition to those who claim refugee status. Nonetheless, Malaysia is host to hundreds of thousands of refugees who live not in camp settings but in the community, most in urban environments. Refugees from Myanmar form the vast majority of Malaysia’s refugee population while smaller, though still substantial, communities are made up of refugees who originate from Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Yemen, Somalia, Iraq and Syria. This chapter interrogates key discourses around what a refugee is in Malaysia and how the dominant discourses, or what Michel Foucault calls ‘regimes of truth’, construct refugees and link them above all to the pervasive notion of ‘illegality’. The prevailing discourses pertaining to the refugee population are reiterated and shaped by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Malaysian state and its institutions, civil society, the traditional media and other consumable information systems. Here, these depictions are challenged through an exploration of alternative narratives and readings. In recent years stories of Malaysia’s refugee population have begun to emerge in the mainstream media and elsewhere. These accounts have played an important role in developing the refugee as a figure in the national consciousness. Personal stories recorded with refugees living in Malaysia are explored to demonstrate how refugee narratives are shaped by and speak back to the public discourse.

The relationship between these two technologies has been identified in the archaeological record, however a study to investigate how these two technologies function in tandem has not yet been explored systematically in Australia. This thesis will use replicative and experimental methods to heat treat a sample of silcrete sourced in Queensland and produce an assemblage of backed artefacts. The performance of heat treated silcrete, both in flake production and successful backed artefact production, will be compared against matching raw (untreated) silcrete cores from the same nodule. Analysis will seek to identify the effect of heat treatment within the reduction sequence, and the extent of variation in backed artefact size to establish the level of standardisation achieved. Results suggest that silcrete responds variably to heat treatment. Some source nodules significantly increased the volume of backed artefacts produced per core, as well as improved standardisation of backed artefacts produced to fit an ‘Ideal Backed Artefact’ prototype. However, other source nodules may have reduced backed artefact production qualities. Since heat treatment has varying effects within the reduction sequence, cultural knowledge surrounding source quality would have been a key component of prehistoric technological knowledge. This interpretation advances the argument that silcrete is not monolithic in it response to heat treatment, and therefore may have variation in its use in prehistory.","[0.0117304, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00496237, 0.0, 0.00255462, 0.04655215, 0.00250352, 0.00535814, 0.00417821, 0.00439157, 0.00419282]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Thus all drugs could be enhancement drugs if deemed to be, for the def- inition of enhancement depends on the meaning we, as a society, give to the drugs’ effects. If a drugs’ effects are deemed to be detrimental that drug may be considered a ‘poison’ or ‘toxin’. If the effects of a drug are deemed valuable or beneficial, and the drug is used to restore or sustain ‘health’ or ‘normality’, the drug may be deemed ‘therapeutic’ or a ‘medicine’. If the effects of the drugs are experienced as beneficial but those benefits are not seen as necessary to restore or sustain health, these drugs may be deemed ‘recreational’ (if the drug is used primarily for ‘pleasure’) or ‘enhancing’. Whether or not drug use is considered en- hancement depends in large part on our definition of ‘normality’, and on what we, as a society, value. The term ‘enhancement’ refers to changes that are considered to be in a positive direction, that is, they are ‘im- provements’ or changes that are viewed as increasing value, and that alter an individual to a state which society has deemed above ‘normal’. Enhancement is commonly defined by bioethicists as “interventions that are used to improve human form or functioning beyond what is necessary to restore or sustain health” (Juengst & Moseley, 2019).

This assemblage of crania (n=45) was acquired by one Richard Heinrich Robert Parkinson (1844‐1909), a Danish explorer and anthropologist initially in the employ of the Hamburg based J. C Goddefroy & Sohn in Samoa trading firm. In 1897, after independently settling on the Gazelle Peninsula of New Britain with his family and beginning to make collecting trips to local communities and those on neighboring islands, this collection of crania eventually came to reside at its present location. This article provides the first in‐depth analysis of the osteology of this collection contextualized within what is known and knowable about its ownership history and movement between collection and arrival in Stockholm. This includes translation of previously untranslated German documents that provide heretofore undisclosed information about Parkinson’s collecting activities. Osteological analysis includes age and sex estimation, taphonomic modification as an indicator of initial depositional environment, discussion of select examples of pathology and trauma, and the comparative analysis of decorative motifs (where present). Results indicate a primarily young adult male assemblage, but with all major age classes and both sexes present. Incidents of trauma and pathology are low, but some unique examples are highlighted.

However, brief emotions, such as surprise, have received limited analytic attention in cancer illness narratives. Drawing on 20 interviews with 11 participants with diverse cancer diagnoses, along with the 455 photographs they produced for this study, we address the complex interactions between discourse, societal expectations, and perceptions in moral-affective economies. Tracing the emergence, deployment, and silencing of surprise provided an avenue to explore connections between affect, morality, advocacy, and philanthropy. We show how surprise works to deny uncertainties couched in individual risk, and situate cancer causation within the logics of anticipation, (re)producing socio-cultural etiology narratives. Attending to surprise reveals how some cancers are situated as individual responsibilities, with restricted access to compassion and collective resources. Thus, we interrogate the affective-moral economy underpinning cancer illness narratives, and surprise’s pivotal role in its analysis.","[0.0310929197, 0.0, 0.00664387214, 5.60660466e-05, 0.0030531214, 0.0011549667, 0.0455233121, 0.00308146428, 0.00765617582, 0.00032733257, 0.00805707819, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

This is case for many developed countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States of America, and member states of the European Union. Older cohorts will comprise a larger proportion of overall populations, driven in part by our increases in life expectancy. An ageing population poses challenges for governments; notably, older people tend to have multiple, chronic health conditions which can place a burden of health budgets. At the same time, we are witnessing a shift in how we respond to the health needs of our populations, with global drug policy acknowledging that some substances are contributing to increased morbidity and mortality (e.g. opioids) while others may have beneficial therapeutic effects (e.g. psylocibin, cannabis). There is general agreement that as men age their levels of testosterone decrease, and there is some evidence to suggest that there have been population-level declines in testosterone which are not associated with age. Anecdotally, testosterone is accessed by men seeking to self-medicate in the belief that they are experiencing low testosterone levels. There has also been a rise in anti-ageing clinics in the United States, providing access to testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). The non-medical use of testosterone can result in a number of adverse health events, including complications from the use of black market or underground products. Placing testosterone under a new prescribing regime may address some of these concerns, but is society ready for this change, and if so, what would this regime loo

Non-prescribed testosterone use is typically illegal, described as ‘enhancement’ or ‘doping’, and considered a problem. However, research has found that some non-prescribed testosterone use may be therapeutic (i.e. self-medication). Little is known about testosterone self- medication. It has been noted among individuals who use image and performance enhancing drugs (IPEDs), but never systematically explored. Approach: This paper describes the findings of a 4-year ethnographic study in online forums and social media groups frequented by people who use IPEDs. It focusses on 31 men who used enhancement doses of testosterone, but who described some of their testosterone use as ‘testosterone replacement therapy’ (TRT). In particular, it focuses on the 26 (84%) of these individuals who self-medicated TRT. Data was analysed thematically (using NVivo) in order to answer the question: ‘how and why is testosterone self-medicated?’. Using Bacchi’s (2016) prob- lematization approach to policy analysis, this paper also asks, ‘what happens to the ‘problem’ of non-prescribed testosterone use if such use is therapeutic?’. Findings: Self-medicated TRT was found to be very similar to TRT as practised in medical contexts. Self- medication was often practised because of an inability to access testosterone through health practitioners (who were either reluctant or unable to prescribe). However, some individuals were found to prefer self-medication because of price, ease of access, reliability of supply, and because health practitioners were perceived as lacking expertise regarding testosterone use. Conclusion: By documenting the therapeutic use of test

Our inquiry was ‘supra-disciplinary’ involving public health, sociology, allied health and consumer collaborators. Specifically, we considered relationality – the feelings circulating between bodies/objects and implicated in MyBackPain’s affective practices; impressions – the marks, images or beliefs MyBackPain makes on bodies/objects; and directionality – how these intra-actions pushed in some directions and away from others. Although Ahmed would likely not consider herself ‘post-humanist’, we argue that her socio-political theories of how objects and emotions entangle are of great interest to furthering critical post-human understandings of health. Rather than threatening decision-making, we suggest that feelings (and their affects) are central to it. The article demonstrates the productive potential of critical post-human inquiry in identifying/countering ‘othering’ possibilities, and catalysing a ‘nomadic shift’ towards new human-non-human formations.","[0.04935719, 0.02521482, 0.04580575, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00839288, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.03188953, 0.02079142]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 3.08563183e-06 9.99999000e-01

In line with the DSM–5 changes, an updated version of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS–5) was released. The CAPS–5 is considered to be the gold-standard measure of PTSD; however, examinations of the psychometric properties and optimal factor structure of this scale are underrepresented in PTSD studies. Methods: This study used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to assess the factor structure of the CAPS–5 using a sample of 267 male Australian Vietnam Veterans. Models drawn from the PTSD CFA literature were used to test the underlying dimensions of PTSD: the four-factor DSM–5 model, six-factor externalizing behaviour and anhedonia models, and seven-factor hybrid model. Results: The results found that the DSM–5 model showed slightly less than adequate fit (comparative fit index [CFI] = 0.90, Tucker–Lewis index [TLI] = 0.88, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.064), however, other models showed acceptable fit. The anhedonia model provided a significantly better fit than the other models (CFI = 0.92, TLI = 0.90, RMSEA = 0.059). Discussion: Overall, the results supported the anhedonia model.

The exponential increase in the volume of CyberTips of CAM offending is placing information processing and decision-making strains on law enforcement. This paper presents the outcomes of a project that reviewed an existing risk assessment tool and then developed a new tool for CAM triaging and investigative prioritisation. Design/methodology/approach Using a mixed method approach, the authors first explored the capacity of an existing risk assessment tool for predicting a police action. The authors then used these findings to design and implement a replacement CAM decision support tool. Using a random sample of CyberTip alert cases from 2018, the authors then tested the efficiency of the new tool. Findings The existing risk assessment tool was not fit for CAM triaging purposes. Just six questions from the old tool were found to be statistically and significantly associated with law enforcement agents achieving a police action. The authors found that an immediate threat of abuse/endangering a child, potential case solvability, CAM image assessment, chat assessment, criticality and some weighting for professional judgement were significant in being associated with a police action. The new decision support tool is more efficient to complete and achieved a 93.6% convergence of risk ratings with the old tool using 2018 case data.

Renewed research and re-dating efforts in Botswana, Zimbabwe, and along the Swahili Coast are transforming models for how inter-regional interaction spheres contributed to these patterns. While societies in present-day Zambia played an important role in the trade of copper, ivory, gold, and other resources between central and southern Africa, little is known about lifeways during the rise of social complexity in this region. This paper reports the results of re-excavation at Kalundu Mound on the Batoka Plateau of southern Zambia, one of the iconic mound sites of the Iron Age “Kalomo Culture.” New radiocarbon dates were combined with the original dates in a series of Bayesian models, indicating that previous chronologies for the site are not reliable and that the mound site likely developed rapidly from AD 1190 to 1410. Archaeobotanical, zooarchaeological, and paleo-proteomic analyses of excavated materials suggests a broad subsistence base combining wild and domesticated species, including the first reported evidence for finger millet (Eleusine coracana) in the region. Considering these findings, it is necessary to re-evaluate the temporal context of the Kalomo site-group, and to also systematically reinvestigate the systems of exchange and subsistence that supported Later Iron Age complexity.","[0.03400197, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04801575, 0.0017242, 0.04392638, 0.00177559, 0.0, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

It has become increasingly apparent in global archaeological studies that the timing, characteristics, and trajectories of coastal resource use are highly variable. Within Africa, discussions of these issues have largely been based on the archaeological record from the south and northeast of the continent, with little evidence from eastern coastal areas leaving significant spatial and temporal gaps in our knowledge. Here, we present data from Panga ya Saidi, a limestone cave complex located 15 km from the modern Kenyan coast, which represents the first long-term sequence of coastal engagement from eastern Africa. Rather than attempting to distinguish between coastal resource use and coastal adaptations, we focus on coastal engagement as a means of characterising human relationships with marine environments and resources from this inland location. We use aquatic mollusc data spanning the past 67,000 years to document shifts in the acquisition, transportation, and discard of these materials, to better understand long-term trends in coastal engagement. Our results show pulses of coastal engagement beginning with low-intensity symbolism, and culminating in the consistent low-level transport of marine and freshwater food resources, emphasising a diverse relationship through time. Panga ya Saidi has the oldest stratified evidence of marine engagement in eastern Africa, and is the only site in Africa which documents coastal resources from the Late Pleistocene through the Holocene, highlighting the potential archaeological importance of peri-coastal sites to debates abou

Modern New Guineans inherited a unique genetic diversity tracing back 50,000 years, and yet there is currently no model reconstructing their past population dynamics. We generated 58 new whole genome sequences from Papua New Guinea, filling geographical gaps in previous sampling, specifically to address alternative scenarios of the initial migration to Sahul and the settlement of New Guinea. Here, we present the first genomic models for the settlement of northeast Sahul considering one or two migrations from Wallacea. Both models fit our dataset, reinforcing the idea that ancestral groups to New Guinean and Indigenous Australians split early, potentially during their migration in Wallacea where the northern route could have been favored. The earliest period of human presence in Sahul was an era of interactions and gene flow between related but already differentiated groups, from whom all modern New Guineans, Bismarck islanders and Indigenous Australians descend. The settlement of New Guinea was probably initiated from its southeast region, where the oldest archaeological sites have been found. This was followed by two migrations into the south and north lowlands that ultimately reached the west and east highlands. We also identify ancient gene flows between populations in New Guinea, Australia, East Indonesia and the Bismarck Archipelago, emphasizing the fact that the anthropological landscape during the early period of Sahul settlement was highly dynamic rather than the traditional view of extensive isolation.","[0.04903064, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00483081, 0.00297689, 0.0, 0.03010046, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0059798, 0.0, 0.02315264]",politics,"[1.14260799e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Consisting largely of deeply abraded or pecked barred ovals and cupules, the rock art of this region does not fit comfortably into any regional models for rock art previously described. It does, however, exhibit some similarity to art in regions to the east and the west of the plateau. Subject to further archaeological testing, we present a number of exploratory hypotheses with which to explain the presence of the engravings; as part of the ethnographic and contemporary Kasua's cultural suite; as part of a relatively recent (late Holocene) migration of peoples from the Gulf to the plateau; or as part of an earlier movement of people from the west, possibly as part of the movement of people into the Sahul continent in the Late Pleistocene. We conclude that the Great Papuan Plateau is not a late and marginally occupied ‘backwater’ but rather part of a possible corridor of human movement across northern Sahul and a region that could allow us to better understand modern humans as they reached the Sahul continent.

Burglary and robbery offenders and victims who agreed to participate in the trial were randomly assigned to either a face to face conference (experimental) in addition to normal court processing or to a control condition where their case proceeded as usual through London's Crown Courts. Restorative justice has been shown to be effective at reducing reoffending in some contexts. More research is needed, however, to determine why some individuals taking part in restorative justice desist from offending whilst others reoffend quickly. Research suggests that individual characteristics such as gender, race and age, criminal history features such as frequency, seriousness, and custody, and ancillary factors such as drug use and victimization can have an impact on offending, and this thesis investigates the extent to which these variables predict time to reoffending. Using survival analysis, this thesis also explores whether, in a sample of serious adult offenders, the effects of restorative justice on time to reoffending are different at different values of these variables. Key findings include: o In the burglary experiment, female offenders reoffended significantly faster than males, and females in the control condition reoffended twice as fast as females in the experimental condition. o The higher the frequency of arrests or convictions, and/or the greater the seriousness of offending prior to random assignment, the faster project offenders reoffended. This effect was significant in the burglary experiment. o Highly frequent and highly serious offenders (based on criminal history prior to random a

To better understand the timing and nature of the introduction of domesticated caprines (sheep and goat) to these islands, this study applied collagen peptide fingerprinting (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry or ZooMS) to archaeological remains from eight Iron Age sites, dating between ca 300 and 1000 CE, in the Zanzibar, Mafia and Comoros archipelagos. Where previous zooarchaeological analyses had identified caprine remains at four of these sites, this study identified goat at seven sites and sheep at three, demonstrating that caprines were more widespread than previously known. The ZooMS results support an introduction of goats to island eastern Africa from at least the seventh century CE, while sheep in our sample arrived one–two centuries later. Goats may have been preferred because, as browsers, they were better adapted to the islands' environments. The results allow for a more accurate understanding of early caprine husbandry in the study region and provide a critical archaeological baseli

Most pastoralists are financed by bank credit, which is an important tool for managing business development plans and responding to situations of drought and changes in market conditions. This credit is serviced by a small group of professional agri-finance bankers who often reside in the region and develop long-term relationships with their clients. In this chapter, we explore the role of these relationships between pastoral landholders and bankers in shaping and moderating credit markets. We show that these relationships are not only symptomatic but also generative of moral economies in agricultural credit markets. Our evidence suggests that relationship lending may not only increase access to credit during economic contractions, as has been previously reported, but may also decrease access to credit during economic expansions. These relationships mediate the effects of global capital markets on Northern Australian pastoralism, influencing patterns of financing in the region. This contributes to understandings of financialisation as assembled by a diverse range of work by both financial and non-financial actors, whose interactions contribute to and resist financialising patterns in often unpredictable ways. https://www.routledge.com/Markets-in-their-Place-Context-Culture-Finance/Prince-Henry-Morris-Gallagher-FitzHerbert/p/book/9780367273408","[0.0367825, 0.01047645, 0.01449551, 0.01189425, 0.01506053, 0.0118103, 0.0148515, 0.0, 0.01553513, 0.00013882, 0.01173455, 0.00751952]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Highlanders from Asia, America and Africa have been shown to exhibit different biological adaptations, but Oceanian populations remain understudied [Woolcock et al., 1972; Cotes et al., 1974; Senn et al., 2010]. We tested the hypothesis that highlanders phenotypically differ from lowlanders in Papua New Guinea, as a result of inhabiting the highest mountains in Oceania for at least 20,000 years. Materials and methods: We collected data for 13 different phenotypes related to altitude for 162 Papua New Guineans living at high altitude (Mont Wilhelm, 2,300-2,700 m above sea level (a.s.l.) and low altitude (Daru, <100m a.s.l.). Multilinear regressions were performed to detect differences between highlanders and lowlanders for phenotypic measurements related to body proportions, pulmonary function, and the circulatory system. Results: Six phenotypes were significantly different between Papua New Guinean highlanders and lowlanders. Highlanders show shorter height (p-value = 0.001), smaller waist circumference (p-value = 0.002), larger Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) (p-value = 0.008), larger maximal (p-value = 3.20e -4) and minimal chest depth (p-value = 2.37e -5) and higher haemoglobin concentration (p-value = 3.36e -4).

Despite the efficacy of procedural justice, however, some have argued that procedural justice scholarship is too narrowly focussed on how police treat citizens. Citizens’ concerns about police acting within the limits of appropriate power (i.e., “bounded-authority” concerns), as well as representativeness in policing (i.e., “representative bureaucracy”), can also influence citizens’ judgments of police legitimacy. This study explores how, when, and why procedural justice, bounded authority, and representation concerns shape Muslims’ perceptions of police CT measures and police legitimacy. Using focus group data from 104 Australian-Muslims, results revealed that CT measures that include Muslims as partners in terrorism prevention and those that draw on principles of procedural justice were perceived most favourably, and were seen to promote police legitimacy.

This is the first rock art site to be recorded in Mithaka Country, which is in a part of Australia's sandy deserts where rock art is uncommon. Gilparrka Almira is placed within a broader social context by exploring its possible cultural connections with other sites and regions. Regional comparisons of the main motif type found that proportions decreased in all directions away from the site. Possible meanings for crescent imagery are then examined from ethnohistorical sources, indicating that crescent motifs may bear a range of “discontinuous” meanings that can be used in different contexts. It is suggested that crescent motifs may have moved/diffused across vast areas of the continent, following the north-south Lake Eyre Basin trade network, with Mithaka Country lying at its approximate centre, and other (east-west) trade routes, along the Dreaming tracks with which the trade routes are frequently associated. Motifs with “discontinuous” meaning ranges, like crescents, would have been particularly suitable for use in this scenario because of their ability to be readily incorporated into different social contexts.

Our archaeological research revealed unknown aspects, such as the scale of Mithaka quarrying, which could stimulate re-evaluation of Aboriginal socio-economic systems in parts of ancient Australia.","[0.00392529, 0.0, 0.0035564, 0.00209528, 0.00803613, 0.00947981, 0.01320735, 0.0, 0.07469092, 0.0, 0.05778513, 0.00745167]",economy,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

We demonstrate that marsupial remains form a significant component of Australian zooarchaeological assemblages, yet high resolution taxonomic identification of these remains continues to prove challenging, owing to a combination of high species diversity and few resources which provide diagnostic criteria for discriminating morphologically similar, but ecologically variable taxa. The lack of robust protocols for discriminating marsupial taxa significantly impacts our ability to effectively integrate zooarchaeological data into broader narratives of Aboriginal colonisation, resilience and adaptation across Australia. Publication of identification protocols would help refine and standardise diagnostic criteria used between analysts, improve the methodological transparency of zooarchaeological analysis and provide resources for the training of a new generation of specialists. A range of opportunities currently exist, utilising qualitative and quantitative techniques, to significantly contribute towards the methodological robustness of zooarchaeological practice in Australia.

Repeated interactions at neighbourhood places over time lay the foundation for the development of social cohesion and collective efficacy. In this study, we examine the proposition that changes in the presence or arrangement of neighbourhood places can destabilise social cohesion and collective efficacy, which has implications for crime. Using spatially integrated crime, social survey and parcel-level land-use classification data, we estimate mixed effects panel models predicting changes in theft and nuisance crimes across 147 Australian neighbourhoods. The findings are consistent with neighbourhood social control and crime opportunity theories. Neighbourhood development – indicated by fewer vacant properties and fewer industrial and agricultural sites – is associated with higher collective efficacy and less crime over time. Conversely, introducing more restaurants, transit stations and cinemas is associated with higher theft and nuisance over time regardless of neighbourhood collective efficacy.

With rapid globalisation, and the global population forecast to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, this problem will only intensify. Fresh fish is the primary source of animal protein for many nations, and this is particularly true for equatorial nations in the Pacific. As fish stocks strain under climate change and increasing fishing pressure, their decline and collapse is becoming a common story. Predicted changes in fish populations indicate that equatorial nations will likely bear the brunt of nutritional insecurity, and this is particularly likely for Pacific nations where agricultural land is limited [1]. Given global threats to fisheries, and their importance to village diets in the Pacific, it is critical that fisheries resources are well managed to ensure food security for future generations. We interviewed 87 women across three villages in Marovo Lagoon, Western Province, Solomon Islands about their role in fisheries and fishery-related activities within their communities.. Of the women interviewed, 80.7% indicated that they do fish or harvest invertebrates. 84.5% of fisherwomen were primarily targeting finfish, not invertebrates, and most women (59.4%) indicated that they harvested seafood solely to feed their families. Results from this study contribute to a growing body of literature highlighting the high involvement of women in small-scale fisheries, and their contributions to household food security.

However, there has been little focus on potential predictors of change and analysis of mechanisms of change. This study aims to identify mediators and moderators of change in a pragmatic, multisite, randomised controlled trial of the Parents under Pressure (PuP) program, a family-focused intervention for parents with substance use and other problems, and treatment-as-usual (TAU). Design Secondary analysis of data: multilevel modelling was used to investigate moderators of treatment outcome; mediation was tested with cross-lagged models. Setting Community-based family support services in the United Kingdom. Participants Parents (N=100) attending community-based addiction services with children aged 2.5 years or younger. Measurements Predictors of the primary outcome, child abuse potential, were: baseline child age and gender, composite family risk score, parental substance use, and parental emotional dysregulation. Mediation was tested across three time-points with the observed variables parental emotion dysregulation and child abuse potential. Findings Increased child age (z = 2.14, CI95% 0.01, 0.33) at baseline was associated with greater reductions in child abuse potential for PuP program participants, compared with TAU. Poorer parental emotional regulation (z = 2.48, CI95% -2.76, -0.32) was associated with greater reductions in child abuse potential for all participants.

Assaults occur significantly less frequently in summer than in spring and there is a greater propensity for assaults to occur on weekends compared to weekdays. Neighborhood disadvantage, ethnic diversity, and the presence of risky facilities such bars, schools, or shops increased the propensity for assault above and beyond the effect of temperature.

Here we describe the partial skeleton of a roughly 2.5- to 3.0-year-old child dating to 78.3 ± 4.1 thousand years ago, which was recovered in the MSA layers of Panga ya Saidi (PYS), a cave site in the tropical upland coast of Kenya7,8. Recent excavations have revealed a pit feature containing a child in a flexed position. Geochemical, granulometric and micromorphological analyses of the burial pit content and encasing archaeological layers indicate that the pit was deliberately excavated. Taphonomical evidence, such as the strict articulation or good anatomical association of the skeletal elements and histological evidence of putrefaction, support the in-place decomposition of the fresh body. The presence of little or no displacement of the unstable joints during decomposition points to an interment in a filled space (grave earth), making the PYS finding the oldest known human burial in Africa. The morphological assessment of the partial skeleton is consistent with its assignment to Homo sapiens, although the preservation of some primitive features in the dentition supports increasing evidence for non-gradual assembly of modern traits during the emergence of our species.

This growing economic divide has driven housing prices up and left lower-income families unable to access the housing market in inner-city locations. In contrast to other countries, Australia’s socioeconomic segregation does not overlap with ethnic segregation. Australia’s highly regulated immigration program has resulted in a relatively well-educated and employable foreign-born population who largely reside in middle-income neighbourhoods. These particularities make Australia an interesting context to explore patterns of socioeconomic segregation over time. In this chapter, we will utilise both traditional measures of segregation (such as the dissimilarity index) as well more spatialised measures (such as location quotients and Local Morans I ) to assess socioeconomic segregation at the local level. Drawing on four waves of census data (2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016), we explore how socioeconomic segregation has changed over time across nearly 500 neighbourhoods in Melbourne. We further examine the degree to which socioeconomic segregation aligns with ethnic segregation patterns and levels in this city. We find patterns of socioeconomic segregation remain relatively unchanging over time in Melbourne. Additionally, our findings highlight important differences in patterns and levels of socioeconomic and ethnic segregation in the Australian context.","[0.02498326, 0.0, 0.01124048, 0.01335583, 0.00241254, 0.01307994, 0.02669282, 0.01358412, 0.02462092, 0.00748323, 0.0, 0.00440941]",health_medicine,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.08485825e-06

This article examines the work being done to prepare land for external investment. It provides an example of emergent assetization processes being undertaken outside the financial sector, driven by social outcomes seemingly beyond the domain of shareholder value. Paradoxically, individuals engaged in these asset‐making processes may oppose the withdrawal of direct funding for community development associated with a financialization of development, yet they are left with few options but to further these efforts by seeking private finance themselves — facilitating financialization for development.

More broadly, our methods and approaches can readily inform other global migration debates, with results supporting an exit of anatomically modern humans from Africa 63,000–90,000 years ago, and the peopling of Eurasia in as little as 12,000–15,000 years via inland routes.","[0.04644405, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05007243, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00037714, 0.0, 0.02162437]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

FGM is practiced in different parts of the world. With globalisation and the increased movement of people across the globe, FGM is now a global problem. While ending FGM remains a priority, the approaches and strategies being used have generated contested views across the social divide. The purpose of this study is to explore the challenges in combatting FGM as experienced by Black Sub-Saharan African (BSSA) women in Diaspora. Design/methodology/approach This qualitative study used a phenomenological approach. Narratives were collected from 40 BSSA women from 20 Sub-Saharan African countries living in the English West Midlands region. A thematic approach underpinned by the four phases of data analysis in the Silences Framework were used to analyse the data. Findings The research study found that stigmatisation of survivors, utilisation of graphic images in FGM awareness, exclusion of practising communities’ gatekeepers in FGM interventions, conflation of religion and FGM practice and obsession with securing a conviction were obstacles in combating FGM. Diaspora community-driven studies exploring FGM and contested notions in addressing it from women perspectives are scarce. Originality/value This study pulls together the experiences of BSSA women and their perspectives on contested notions in combating FGM in the UK. The debate asserts the growing need to consider gender sensitive radical interventions, which involves educating perpetrators and gatekeepers among FGM practising communities.","[0.00877958, 0.00038222, 0.00169651, 0.10570865, 0.0, 0.00345458, 0.00449886, 0.0, 0.01021705, 0.0016027, 0.04005353, 0.0]",women,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

Yet, there is a long history of productive dialogue and interconnection between these fields. Arts-based research represents a particularly fertile form of arts/science interaction. This paper interweaves poetry, theoretical discussion and empirical research to make the case for spoken word poetry as an arts-based method of inquiry that can provide a radically different way of doing, being and collaborating in and through research. With reference to the innovative method of ‘collaborative poetics’ and to the work of youth slam/spoken word educators, I argue that social scientists and spoken word practitioners can learn much from one another’s tools, techniques and ways of thinking, creating new forms of knowledge, redefining the audience/author relationship, and facilitating a ‘critical resilience’ which enables both individual fortitude in the face of adversity and a means through which to challenge the conditions that give rise to this adversity. The paper thus considers how spoken word as participatory poetic inquiry enables participants, researchers and poets to address the critical complexities and challenges of contemporary life.","[0.04175714, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00302124, 0.00604468, 0.02715264, 0.00446689, 0.00113225, 0.0, 0.0, 0.03585906, 0.0]",politics,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

The experiences of refugees are linked to impaired mental health yet, this population faces barriers to accessing mental health support (Shannon et al., 2016). Digital mental health interventions are increasingly recognised as an avenue for overcoming these barriers (WHO, 2017). The present paper begins by introducing the area of digital approaches to mental health and developments in this area targeted at refugee populations specifically. We then take a step back to look at the wider picture of refugee mental health and technology. Drawing on Toyama’s Law of Amplification (2011; 2015) - that successful technical interventions amplify the intent and the capacity of the people involved - we discuss the importance of context, exploring the assumptions, possibilities and potential pitfalls in the use of digital technologies for addressing refugee mental health. We conclude that by collaborating with refugee populations, placing them at the centre of the design process for digital mental health interventions, we stand the greatest chance of creating the most useful tools.","[0.0, 0.01304245, 0.14837686, 0.02007815, 0.0, 0.01291254, 0.0, 0.00532814, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07746832, 0.03137467]",covid,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

We analyse quantitative data on language proficiency four or more years after resettlement to identify the key characteristics of those who are most likely to have low language proficiency and to be at risk of long-term dependency and exclusion. Qualitative interviews on experiences of language learning suggest that English-language policy and provision serve to exacerbate and compound the risk of social exclusion, rather than ameliorate the risk. Our findings draw attention to the lack of recognition and understanding of the diversity of resettled refugees and their differential capacities, needs and opportunities for learning.

Taking Pakistan's ethno nationalist Mohajir party, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) as a case study, it explores how certain men from the ethnic community of Mohajirs are recruited to the roles and statuses of political killers, and sustain violence as a primary social identity and lifestyle over a period of some years. By drawing on detailed fieldwork in areas involved in the Karachi conflict, the author contributes to understandings of violence, tracing the development of violent aspects of Mohajir nationalism via an exploration of political and cultural contexts of Pakistan's history, and highlighting the repetitive homology of the conflict with the earlier violence of Partition. Through a local comparison of ethnic and religious militancy she also updates the current situation of social and cultural change in Karachi, which is dominantly framed in terms of Islamist radicalization and modernization. In her examination, governance and civil society issues are integrated with the political and psychological dimensions of mobilization processes and violence at micro-, meso- and macro- levels.

However, 3SF remained a purely abstracted philosophical concept until 1994 when a group of anarchists, architects and artists decided to play the game for the first time. Since these early experiments, 3SF has been played and developed across the globe, from anti-racist football festivals in Germany, contemporary art installations in France, through to youth outreach programs in Colombia. Far beyond its emergent context, the game continues to resonate for a myriad of social actors in search of bottom-up ways to enact transformational change in contemporary culture. Drawing from forty-four semi-structured interviews with players, coaches, curators and activists, this paper provides the first ethnography into 3SF and privileges much needed perspectives into how ‘DIY Football’ initiatives are actively redefining individual and collective relationships to sport and politics in informal volunteer settings. Utilising the work of Bourdieu as a useful conceptual heuristic, it details how participants reflect upon, and negotiate, the challenges of reaching beyond the ‘doxic logics’ of binary competitive team sport. Moreover, how the democratic ‘desportised’ spaces of 3SF transcend quotidian sporting contexts and offer distinct forms of political renewal, social inclusion and practical education. This study further contends that the horizontalist non-hierarchical nature of the game develops critical consciousness and community leadership for those involved in the play.","[0.05301032, 0.00950084, 0.0, 0.0046227, 0.00368903, 0.01571006, 0.00387061, 0.00030196, 0.0, 0.0067067, 0.0155701, 0.00573134]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01

Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a case study approach, including interviews observations and reflections from facilitators and members of a service user group for people living with dementia in a recovery-based older adult service in East Kent, UK. In total, 11 people were involved in this study: five people are living with a diagnosis of dementia, two are clinical psychologists, two are trainee clinical psychologists and two are placement year psychology undergraduates. Findings – The paper shows how service user involvement groups can enable people with dementia to train a wide range of healthcare professionals in different areas, from the perspective of people living with dementia and healthcare professionals. It also reflects on the challenges that can arise through working with patients in a more collegiate way. Originality/value – This paper demonstrates that people with dementia can be involved in the training of healthcare professionals in innovative ways.

It explores particularly the co-constructional nature of transnational learning, reflecting on issues of power and trust, from masters to doctoral research in education practice. Rachel and Mark worked together in a student-supervisor relationship, firstly on the MA Education and then on the Doctorate in Education (EdD) programmes, jointly offered by the Mauritius Institute of Education and the University of Brighton, UK. Rachel's research considers narrative and autoethnographic inquiry into educational professionalism, agency and becoming and parallels Mark's own research interest and experience. Our reflections were developed through a series of email exchanges and online discussions, theorised through meta-reflection and analysis. Informed by postcolonial perspectives, the paper notes that the complexity and inequalities of power distribution in such a transnational supervisory relationship are likely to be compounded through shifts to online only encounters. A call for a more rigorous exploration into this aspect of postgraduate research supervision is made, particularly in the context of international and transnational provision.","[0.03301622, 0.0, 0.0161546, 0.0, 0.0, 0.17771231, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",education,"[9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01 8.08667324e-06

Design in this former sense has historically drawn on both arts and engineering to give form to garments, products and visual communication. This article presents a case study, followed by a reflective discussion, of a research project in which research through design methods were used to construct two focus groups involving lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people and police liaison officers as part of a hate crime project. Participants were asked to design reporting devices that would respond to hateful behaviour. Through the design process, participants materialised their own experiences of hate and embodied emotional responses to those experiences. The authors argue that there are methodological, ideological and practical benefits for incorporating research through design methods within qualitative research on crime and victimisation. Design offers a way of critically and creatively reimagining how research methods are understood and utilised, challenging how criminological methodologies traditionally operate.","[0.01099465, 0.00996867, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01153321, 0.0, 0.03344371, 0.00926402, 0.12516688, 0.05919023, 0.0]",criminology,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01

Whilst a pilot for future research, the purpose of this Dissertation is to bring forward the mounting evidence in favour of full legalisation of psychoactive substances. Full legalisation can seem extreme in many disciplines but from a harm reductionist perspective, as well as a critical criminological one, it is the most progressive. Done with the right guidance, care and educated expert input we can understand everyone's subjective reasons for medicating; be it self-medicating in the form of recreational use or access to indispensable medicines for medicinal use. In doing so, we can aim to increase the health and freedom of humankind and reduce the criminalisation of otherwise law abiding citizens.","[0.02405539, 0.04682617, 0.01983238, 0.0, 0.00824715, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00102454, 0.00558468, 0.00427199, 0.03587669, 0.00356383]",sexuality,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01

Hardly a day goes by without further news of brutal stabbings and tragic violence. Yet despite the current preoccupation with ‘knife crime’, stretching back some two decades, a peak in knife violence around 2007, and a resurgence in the problem ten years later, with relatively few exceptions, there has been surprisingly little detailed criminological attention given to it. Although the problem is treated as a matter of fact, a largely self-explanatory label, many commentators have repeatedly acknowledged the difficulty in establishing a consistent, workable and evidence-based definition of ‘knife crime’. What we call ‘knife crime’ consists of a range of different offences and, as our timeline shows, a ‘knife enabled’ code first entered police crime recording in 2001 but it was only in 2011 that year on year comparable knife crime data became available. Subsequently, the inclusion of ‘aggravated’ knife possession offences in the knife crime figures (themselves subject to police activity rates), has further complicated attempts to clarify ‘knife crime’ trends. Yet fears and concerns about knife crime have always been driven by more than just the numbers, such as: the state of youth, urban safety, ‘dangerous others’, even though more than half of contemporary knife violence is inflicted by adults and much of it occurs in more ‘domestic’ contexts. In this chapter we examine both the scale and nature of contemporary knife-enabled violence, and ask to what extent ‘knife crime’ can be defined and understood as a distinct category of offending. In recognising the contradictions and challenges here we begin to outline a framework for a new understanding of knife crime, i

Since then, there has been a great deal of innovation in the sector and it is now possible to find companies providing anti-knife crime posters, t-shirts, stickers, magnets, educational packs, assemblies, teaching resources, knife deposit boxes and much more. Sometimes these are sponsored or associated with particularly fashionable market brands, celebrities or sports stars. The scale of services and products marketed through this crime label accumulate to what we define, following critiques developed around ‘gang interventions’ as a ‘knife crime industry’, with a cross-sector network of influential professionals who benefit from an individualistic and fetishised commodification of the label. Analysing online discourse within this industry, this chapter considers how the meaning of knife crime is constituted and constitutive of this market and profoundly self-fulfilling. We explore the implications of these developments in our broader response to child-on-child violence.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00959813, 0.0011722, 0.0, 0.04020809, 0.0, 0.24685635, 0.00246168, 0.0]",criminology,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.20200203e-06 9.99999000e-01

Contextualising this moment within the politics of a New Labour government from 1997, we consider how the contradictions of an authoritarian social democracy re-articulated the law and order society through a focus on ‘youth crime’ and anti-social behaviour. The publication of the Macpherson report and the official recognition of institutional racism within the Metropolitan Police is a significant cultural moment—the ‘Macpherson effect’—that characterises this period. Existing racialised discourses of ‘gun culture’ and ‘gang culture’ already provided justifications for robust and proactive policing strategies at the turn of the twenty-first century, but the post-Macpherson mobilisation towards ‘knife crime’ (anticipated in the 1997 Knives Act) is a particular development that is often overlooked. The introduction of the ‘knife enabled’ crime recording feature code in 2001 fundamentally changed the way crimes were categorised and reported, culminating in the problematic public definition of ‘knife crime’ as we understand it today. The interaction of events that lead to this moment will be analysed here to establish, again drawing upon Policing the Crisis, a pre-history of the label and its constitution.","[0.01907465, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2864953, 0.0, 0.0]",criminology,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01

More than this, the impact of proactive policing upon youth and communities, especially BAME communities, with periodic roll-outs of stop and search policy, appeared to further alienate many, diminishing trust and confidence, and convincing many young people that knife carrying could offer a degree of protection. In response, especially following the much heralded success of the Strathclyde Community Initiative to Reduce Violence (CIRV) and Boston’s successful gang strategy ‘Operation Ceasefire’ in the USA, a range of international commentators have begun urging the adoption of more ‘joined up’ ‘public health’ approaches to violence. Such strategies have combined with recent WHO advocacy favouring public health, ecological or evidence-led and ‘epidemiological’, models of violence prevention, seeking to rebalance the strategies aimed at addressing knife-involved violence. But a public health violence strategy involves much more than just giving doctors and clinicians the lead, and in the chapter we raise some of the issues. Nevertheless the optimism and popularity of ‘public health’ in violence reduction has entailed a significant shift in knife crime discourse, although it has not been plain sailing—despite much talk, there is little apparent agreement on what a sustainable violence reduction strategy might actually look like as well as questions about the willingness of government—especially in austerity—to adequately fund it. The issue of mandatory A&E reporting of weapon assault injuries to the police has also divided opinion.","[0.00817106, 0.0667288, 0.03390094, 0.0, 0.00037537, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1781802, 0.03571228, 0.0]",criminology,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

The culmination of public pressure and politicisation set the scene for a significant expansion of police powers and related enforcement activity, a renewed commitment to stop and search, a major roll-out of Tasers to front-line police, new legislation, new offences, enhanced sentencing, and new criminal orders. The persistent criminalisation and ‘othering’ of Black youth during this moment very much mirrors the response to ‘mugging’ in the 1970s; a politics of law and order used to re-establish political authority in the midst of economic crisis. This chapter considers how the uncertainties following the global banking crisis in the 2000s, and the contrived politics of austerity which followed, established the foundations for a more authoritarian and disciplinary public policy regime. Here we situate the political focus on ‘knife crime’ in this moment as one amongst a number of important political shifts during a temporary rupture in the maintenance of political authority. This chapter follows the ‘knife crime’ chronology and narrative up to the present, including its return to the headlines around 2015, finally drawing attention to the interaction between the extension of police powers and the political uncertainty during and after Britain’s Brexit referendum and the Covid ‘lockdowns’ which followed.","[0.05498168, 0.0, 0.02472271, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00277485, 0.0, 0.22140251, 0.0, 0.0]",criminology,"[9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

Taking a community psychological perspective to social policy, we aimed to understand lay citizens' lived experience of changes in healthcare commissioning and provision. Thematic analysis of 379 free‐text responses yielded two thematic clusters. Cluster 1 describes the lived experience of citizens considering reforms to the NHS, depicting grief, mortality and fear in uncertainty. Cluster 2 explores where these affective responses may derive from by detailing conceptualisations of the NHS in the lived experience, describing how the NHS was experienced as a complex and embodied phenomenological object. Findings suggest people relate affectively to local commissioning practices, feeling a sense of loss when facing the degradation of ‘their’ NHS.

Examples of these decisions are whether vaccination should be mandatory and, if so, whether to allow for non-medical exemptions. In this article we argue that these policy decisions go beyond typical public health mandates and therefore require democratic input. Methods We report on the design, implementation, and results of a deliberative public forum convened over four days in Ontario, Canada, on the topic of childhood vaccination. Results 25 participants completed all four days of deliberation and collectively developed 20 policy recommendations on issues relating to mandatory vaccinations and exemptions, communication about vaccines and vaccination, and AEFI (adverse events following immunization) compensation and reporting. Notable recommendations include unanimous support for mandatory childhood vaccination in Ontario, the need for broad educational communication about vaccination, and the development of a no-fault compensation scheme for AEFIs. There was persistent disagreement among deliberants about the form of exemptions from vaccination (conscience, religious beliefs) that should be permissible, as well as appropriate consequences if parents do not vaccinate their children. Conclusions We conclude that conducting deliberative democratic processes on topics that are polarizing and controversial is viable and should be further developed and implemented to support democratically legitimate and trustworthy policy about childhood vaccination.","[0.01873189, 0.0, 0.04155926, 0.003955, 0.01032992, 0.00243571, 0.01416248, 0.04538441, 0.0, 0.00161857, 0.01807736, 0.00227243]",child_family,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 7.27715387e-05

Comprised of eight chapters, this introductory text explores the historic development and contemporary thinking relating to gender and its relational components in different contexts across the globe. Whilst modelling the same layout as the third edition, this fourth edition provides new case studies to demonstrate everyday manifestations of gender and revises the analytical treatment of politics, environmental issues, and embodiment to bring all chapters up to date. This edition renews its efforts to be as diverse as possible, drawing on often overlooked gender research and theory from outside of Western Europe, to places such as Finland, Chile, Australia, South Africa, Indonesia, and Japan. Although touting itself as an introduction to academic perspectives on gender, this book is very comprehensive in its scope and covers the social, economic, political, relational, and global dimensions of gender theories. Due to the level of comprehension over such a short book it may be convoluted for lay audiences or those who are new to philosophies and social theories of gender. Indeed, this is no ‘easy-read’ overview of gender scholarship. Personally, I would recommend this to undergraduate students in their final years of university or postgraduate students who wish to specialise in gender research over those who are new to gender theory.

Nonetheless, there is only a relatively small body of research exploring what it is like to live with dementia from the perspectives of people who have this condition. This is partly because of the (implicit or explicit) belief that people with dementia lack insight into their condition and cannot talk about their experiences clearly. In this article, I argue that such beliefs are typically both erroneous and unhelpful, and that there is great value in seeking to illuminate the lived experiences of people with dementia. I present an interpretative phenomenological analysis of data from semi-structured interviews with six participants who had moderate dementia. I elicit five themes from this analytic process, and discuss the three most prominent here: Awareness and understanding of dementia, clarity and confusion, and social support and relationships. I mobilise these themes to narrate the lived experiences of people with dementia, demonstrating their awareness both of the difficulties presented by dementia and of the negative perceptions of others.","[0.0, 0.00698598, 0.0, 0.00033129, 0.00536592, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00262673, 0.0, 0.12809681, 0.00459973]",community_service,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

Rarely, however, has the literature on professions explored processes of professionalization in devoliping, post-colonial contexts. This article contributes to this body of literature in the study of professions in a number of ways. Firstly, it 'maps' the growth of social work in the Filippines, placing this account within a broader discussions of social work as an internationality activity (Harrison & Melville, 2010; Lyons, 2006) and identifying some of the key forms and features of social work in the Filippines. Consideration is given to the degree of professionalisation of social work within the country by exploring professional organisation, regulation and education. In doing this, the article offers a critical overview of the nature and preoccupations of social work in the Filippines and celebrates the invaluable contributions it makes to the country and its people. The article argue that the forms social work takes and the settings in wich it happens reflect both contemporay societal and environmental factors as well as the global development of social work. In this sense, the article considers the impact of Roman Catholicism as well as the orientation of social work in relation to some enduring tensions and debates around the profession's purpose and potential.

This article, the first of its kind as far as the authors are aware, reports on an ongoing qualitative exploration of an example of contemporary human–animal interaction on the fringes of a British city: volunteer shepherding (‘lookering’). Participants are part of a conservation grazing scheme, a growing phenomenon in recent years that relies on increasingly popular volunteer programmes. The primary volunteer role in such schemes is to spend time outdoors checking the welfare of livestock. The first section of the article summarises developments in more-than-human and multispecies research methodologies, and how the challenges of exploring the non- and more-than-human in particular are being addressed. In the second section, we frame our own approach to a human–animal relation against this emerging literature and detail the practicalities of the methods we used. The third section details some of our findings specifically in terms of what was derived from the peculiarities of our method.

This article, the first of its kind as far as the authors are aware, reports on an ongoing qualitative exploration of an example of contemporary human–animal interaction on the fringes of a British city: volunteer shepherding (‘lookering’). Participants are part of a conservation grazing scheme, a growing phenomenon in recent years that relies on increasingly popular volunteer programmes. The primary volunteer role in such schemes is to spend time outdoors checking the welfare of livestock. The first section of the article summarises developments in more-than-human and multispecies research methodologies, and how the challenges of exploring the non- and more-than-human in particular are being addressed. In the second section, we frame our own approach to a human–animal relation against this emerging literature and detail the practicalities of the methods we used. The third section details some of our findings specifically in terms of what was derived from the peculiarities of our method.

Interactive music provides one of the most effective psychosocial interventions for people with dementia; it can allay agitation and promote wellbeing. Since COVID-19 has halted the delivery of in-person musical activities, it is important for the welfare of people with dementia and their carers to investigate what alternatives to live music making exist, how these alternatives are delivered and how their accessibility can be expanded. This community case study examines recent practice in online music-making in response to COVID-19 restrictions for people with dementia and their supporters, focusing on a UK context. It documents current opportunities for digital music making, and assesses the barriers and facilitators to their delivery and accessibility. Online searches of video streaming sites and social media documented what music activities were available. Expert practitioners and providers collaborated on this study and supplied input about the sessions they had been delivering, the technological challenges and solutions they had found, and the responses of the participants. Recommendations for best practice were developed and refined in consultation with these collaborators. Over 50 examples of online music activities were identified. In addition to the challenges of digital inclusion and accessibility for some older people, delivering live music online has unique challenges due to audio latency and sound quality.

The authors largely draw on ethnographic data based on interviews with walkers in Estonia and participant observation of one way walks in England organised by the British Pilgrimage Trust. The contemporary proliferation of pilgrimage routes across northern Europe is remarkable given the destruction of shrines during the Protestant Reformation and the concomitant rapid decline in those walking to those shrines, except in Ireland and in one of Baltic States studied here, Lithuania. While pilgrimage revived as a religious practice in England during the early twentieth century , contemporary pilgrimage has become more inclusive, being bound up with the increasing popularity of walking as a leisure activity in Europe after the Second World War, the increasing degree of individual choice, the reinterpretation of pilgrimage as a ""spiritual"" journey and increasing interest in heritage.

Therefore, it is important to establish the characteristics and labour market performance of migrants from these countries who have subsequently entered the UK. We principally analyse Labour Force Survey data to compare the labour market outcomes of recent migrants from Poland and other accession countries to those of earlier migrant cohorts from these countries as well as to those of other recent migrants to the UK. We find that the majority of post-enlargement migrants from accession countries have found employment in low paying jobs, despite some (especially Poles) having relatively high levels of education. It follows that recent Polish migrants typically have lower returns to their education than other recent arrivals. Migrants from the new entrants who arrived immediately prior to enlargement possess similar characteristics and labour market outcomes, apart from having a higher propensity to be self-employed.

Latent infections by GTD pathogens in rootstock cuttings are a major source of the pathogens in grafted nursery vines and subsequently in new vineyards. The many pruning cuts made at the crowns of mother vines predispose them to infection which is transmitted to the new shoots via the xylem. Direct penetration by epiphytic inoculum on the bark of the shoots/canes can also occur. Mother vines with unprotected pruning wounds are typically heavily infected, particularly if they are not trellised. Availability of pruning wound treatments is limited in many countries. The spread of GTD pathogen inoculum can be reduced by avoiding sprinkler and flood irrigation, by trellising mother vines so that canopies are off the soil, and by spraying fungicides or painting wounds immediately after canes are harvested. Frequent trunk renewal aids in reducing inoculum. Cuts should be made to retain long internodes on the mother vines, cuttings should not contact the soil and pruning debris should be promptly destroyed. Cutting implements should be disinfested regularly and cuttings should be dipped in a registered fungicide or sterilant. Soaking cuttings increases fungal populations in the basal wounds and softens the bark, favouring penetration by pathogen inoculum. Dormant bench grafting in nurseries produces more GTD-symptomatic vines than field chip budding, so improved management for rootstock mother vines is more important where dormant cuttings are bench grafted.

The population-based incidence and risk factors of GDM, particularly in lower socio-economic populations, are not known. We conducted analyses on data from a population-based cohort of pregnant women in South Delhi, India, to determine the incidence of GDM, its risk factors and association with adverse pregnancy outcomes (stillbirth, preterm birth, large for gestational age babies) and need for caesarean section. Methods: We analyzed data from the intervention group of the Women and Infants Integrated Interventions for Growth Study (WINGS), an individually randomized factorial design trial. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at the time of confirmation of pregnancy, and for those who had a normal test (≤140 mg), it was repeated at 24-28 and at 34-36 weeks. Logistic regression was performed to ascertain risk factors associated with GDM. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated to find association between GDM and adverse pregnancy outcomes and need for caesarean section. Results: 19.2% (95% CI: 17.6 to 20.9) pregnant women who had at least one OGTT were diagnosed to have GDM. Women who had prediabetes at the time of confirmation of pregnancy had a significantly higher risk of developing GDM (RR 2.08, 95%CI 1.45 to 2.97). Other risk factors independently associated with GDM were woman’s age (adjusted OR (AOR) 1.10, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.15) and BMI (AOR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.07).

In 2017, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB)-a secessionist movement in the South-East of Nigeria, became the second conflict group or social movement to be proscribed by the anti-terror law. Unlike Boko Haram, IPOB’s struggle is underlined, to a large extent, by genuine grievance and its modi operandi is largely non-violent. Unsurprisingly, the proscription of IPOB did not generate the same worldwide recognition and support as that of Boko Haram. Rather, it attracted national and international condemnations. Yet, the Nigerian government has not reversed its action. This raises important questions regarding the motivation for proscribing IPOB and the impact on the group’s transformation as well as on other conflict groups and situations across Nigeria. Interestingly, the current government led by President Buhari, a Fulani, has been noticeably silent or at best expressed weak response to the ‘terrorist’ acts committed by the Fulani militia group. Also, the government’s reluctance to proscribe the militant groups in the oil rich Niger Delta region counteracts any argument regarding fairness in the application of the anti-terrorism law. This chapter therefore analyses the characteristics of each conflict group and why they attract the kind of labelling, and the implications of such on the transformation of the conflict group and the benefits or drawbacks to the government and the conflict actors.","[0.04497608, 0.0, 0.00156893, 0.0, 0.01233355, 0.0, 0.01542763, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01361918, 0.00824097, 0.0]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

Using an inductive analysis of in-depth interviews with 25 drag performers, alongside netnography of media and other public data, this article develops a sociological understanding of the mainstreaming of drag. There are two clear reasons for the success of drag. First, there is a pull towards drag: it is now seen as a viable career opportunity where performers receive fame rather than social stigma in a more inclusive social zeitgeist, even though the reality is more complex. Second, there is a push away from other creative and performing arts because heteronormative perspectives persist through typecasting and a continued professional stigma associated with drag. In calling for a sociology of drag, future avenues for research on contemporary drag are discussed, alongside the need for the sociology of cultural and creative industries to incorporate sexuality as both a subject and analytic lens.","[0.02257406, 0.00971003, 0.00144105, 0.00539715, 0.00013241, 0.00576192, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00548321, 0.00300533, 0.01490548, 0.00231445]",politics,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.94090645e-05

Aims: The present study sought to examine the perceived impact of social lockdown on sexual fantasy and solitary sexual behavior among UK young adults in various living situations. Methods: A convenience sample of 565 adults aged 18-32 and living in the UK completed anonymous, web-based, study-specific questionnaires between May 14 and 18, 2020, 7 weeks after social lockdown was initiated. Mixed-method analyses were conducted. Main outcome measures: The study presents qualitative and quantitative data. Criterion variables were measured dichotomously as increases (vs no change) in sexual fantasy and increases (vs no change) in pornography consumption. Predictor variables were living arrangement, relationship status, and postlockdown changes in masturbation and pornography consumption. Results: Of all, 34.3% engaged in more sexual fantasizing during lockdown; women were more likely than men to report this increase. Living context and relationship status were predictors of increased fantasizing. Of all, 30.44% reported an increase in at least one solitary sexual practice. This increase was associated with an increase in sexual fantasizing and also with increased pornography consumption. Nineteen percent of participants reported an increase in pornography use, with men being more likely than women to report this increase. Participants mostly attributed their increases to boredom, increased free time, and replacing partnered sex. Conclusion: Shifts in sexual fantasizing and solitary sexua

Significant focus has been placed on risky practices, yet the broader associations between drug use and sexual activities remain elusive outside such contexts. This is despite similar trends of liberalizing attitudes and practices being identified in each area, theorized as the normalization of recreational drug use and the liberalization of consensual sexual practice. In this article, we draw on convenience sample surveys of 966 festival-goers at an English music festival in 2016 and 2019 to assess prevalence of polydrug use and to examine whether people who consume illicit drugs are more likely to engage in sexual behaviors considered more liberal than the traditional norm. We show that people who reported polydrug use in the last 12 months were significantly more likely to engage in non-traditional sexual behaviors, including sex with a friend and anal sex, in that same time period. In combining and comparing two usually distinct discourses, this exploratory study suggests that the normalization of drugs and the liberalization of consensual sexual practices are related and can be conceptualized as part of a broader societal acceptance and cultural accommodation of illicit drug use and particular sexual practices as leisure activities, despite markedly different policy and legal contexts for each activity. We conclude that the concept of “normalization” may be more appropriate to understanding changes in sexuality than “liberalization” in the context of “leisure sex” and call for further cross-disciplinary research on drugs and sex using this approach.","[0.00507089, 0.3674583, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02082757, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00789973]",sexuality,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

The adoption of the declaration not only marks an important moment in terms of lawmaking; it also represents the achievement of long decades of lobbying and advocacy from indigenous peoples’ representatives. The UN declared the decade 1994–2004 as the First International Decade of the World’s Indigenous Peoples, and later 2005–2015 was declared the second such decade. The main objective was the strengthening of international cooperation for the solution of problems faced by indigenous people in such areas as human rights, the environment, education, and health. As a result, in 2002, the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues was established as an advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council. But it was only in 2007 that the UN General Assembly adopted the UNDRIP, which universally proclaims and consolidates a specific international legal corpus of rights for indigenous peoples. The adoption of the declaration is representative of the significant legal developments of the rights of indigenous peoples under international law. The international legal framework concerns general human rights such as nondiscrimination and equality, as well as very specific collective rights such as self-determination, cultural rights, land rights, and control over natural resources.

I begin with an historical overview of sacralising the landscape through Catholic pilgrimage and then introduce two theoretical approaches within pilgrimage studies (the phenomenological and relational) towards this process in the context of contemporary pilgrimage. This leads to a detailed case study of Lourdes, one of the most popular European pilgrimage shrines, where the landscape has been radically altered through the process of sacralisation where two types of water-the spring uncovered by St Bernadette during her visions in 1858 and associated with 'miraculous' healing and the river Gave-play an ever-present and potentially disruptive role. I focus particularly on the internal landscape of the baths where people engage intimately with the spring water and draw on my own experience of working as a helper between 1968 and 1992 and then again between 2013 and 2017. This enables me to explore the sensuous experience of bathing and issue of risk and trust by drawing on both discursive representations and the relational perspective. This eclectic approach also helps us to place Lourdes and its changing landscape within a wider environmental and political-economic context. Nature and Place Pilgrimage The subjugation of nature by human institutions to create an ordered, predictable and 'sacred' landscape has a long history. Machu Pichu, Stonehenge, Rome, Jerusalem, Mecca and Varanasi are just some of the most famous pilgrimage sites where landscapes reveal how the local habitat has been sacralised in the pursuit of religious interests.

Welfarisation constructs individuals or groups as needing social support or constitutes them as unworthy of it. How female drug users are targeted for welfarisation or ‘soft-policing’ through formal and informal social control mechanisms is explored. Interventions in the lives of female users presented as policies and practices of welfare (concerned with their well-being) are often experienced as intrusive, coercive and punitive. This chapter investigates the surveillance and regulation of drug using women through welfare and social work policies and practices. Some contextual background including neoliberal policies focusing on risk and responsibility is provided. How welfarisation policies such as the denial of social security benefits and social work interventions impact on female users and their children is discussed. According to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) in Hidden harm, the children of drug-using parents are likely to be exposed to a range of hazards ‘as a result of parental problem drug use’ (ACMD, 2011, p 10, emphasis added). These include physical and emotional abuse or neglect, dangerously inadequate supervision, toxic substances in the home and exposure to criminal or other inappropriate adult behaviour. However, also included in the list of problems apparently caused by drug use are poverty, inadequate accommodation and unsatisfactory education (ACMD, 2011). Drug-using parents are therefore responsibilised for a range of social problems they may experience, which are constituted as in their control and as an outcome of their behaviour. The

In this article, we draw on a year-long ethnography of elite sport and 48 in-depth interviews with elite male and female athletes at a British university to explore the impact of various forms of gender mixing during training, which we call ‘gender-collaborative training’. While men’s and women’s teams competing against each other in practice matches resulted in gender-essentialist narratives attributing difference to biology, gender-integrated practices and workouts provided opportunities for men and women to train together without the gendered sport-specific associations that can reproduce sexism. We call for gender-collaborative training to be adopted by gender-segregated teams, and suggest that where there is resistance to any integration, teams start with mixed physical workouts and progress to mixed sport-specific training and then mixed competitive training.","[0.00382438, 0.09001611, 0.0, 0.14272431, 0.0002155, 0.03435574, 0.00043084, 0.0, 0.0017385, 0.0018645, 0.0, 0.0]",women,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01

In order to address this occlusion, this article draws on life history interviews with 30 older Muslim women living in Tehran and Karaj. Adopting a biographical life course approach, and examining pivotal moments related to sexuality in their lives, we discuss how cultural meanings and symbols of sexuality have emerged and been negotiated by these women at the life stages of puberty, first sex at marriage, and menopause.

Starting with an analysis of the dominant dichotomies underlying the literature on labour transnationalism, I suggest that stepping outside these dichotomies can provide a different way of assessing the role of transnational labour solidarity within broader struggles for workers’ justice. In this article, drawing upon the case of transnational political solidarities built by workers inside Canadian unions in the 1980s and 1990s, I argue that assessing transnational practices with a longer view to class formation and the goals of workers’ emancipation can help to expand conceptions of what constitutes successful transnational practice. Such a reassessment of the role of labour transnationalism is particularly timely in the current context of right-wing populism.","[0.04622593, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01938412, 0.02322831, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02848483, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07338843]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

In the introduction to this special issue, we briefly chart the intellectual genealogy of political ecology, identify vital challenges faced today, and present a new set of studies that respond to these concerns. We conceptualize power as a social relation built on the asymmetrical distribution of resources and risks and locate power in the interactions among, and the processes that constitute, people, places, and resources. Politics, then, are found in the practices and mechanisms through which such power is circulated. The focus here is on politics related to the environment, understood as biophysical phenomena, together with human knowledge and practice. To apply these concepts, we promote multiscale research models that articulate selected ecological phenomena and local social processes, together with regional and global forces and ideas. We also advocate methods for research and practice that are sensitive to relations of difference and power among and within social groups. Rather than dilute ecological dimensions of study, this approach aims to strengthen our ability to account for the dialectical processes through which humans appropriate, contest, and manipulate the world around them.","[0.15117648, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00353778, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",politics,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

These samples were assessed for population genetic parameters that impact forensic statistical calculations. All population samples were highly polymorphic for the 16 Y STR markers with the marker DYS385 being the most polymorphic, because it is comprised of two loci. Most (2677 out of a total of 2806 distinct haplotypes) of the 16 marker haplotypes observed in the sample populations were represented only once in the data set. Haplotype diversities were greater than 99.57% for the Chinese, Malay, Thai, Japanese, and Indian sample populations. For the Y STR markers, population substructure correction was considered when calculating the rarity of a Y STR profile. An F(ST) value, rather than a R(ST) value, is more appropriate under a forensic model. Because the F(ST) values are very small within the Asian populations, the estimate of the rarity of a haplotype comprised of 10-16 markers does not need substructure correction. However haplotypes with fewer markers may require F(ST) corrections when calculating the rarity of the profile.","[0.0005668, 0.0011426, 0.00240534, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04794072, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Despite improvements in the subnational disclosure of royalty payments, a significant problem is the failure of these efforts to improve accountability and benefits to mining communities. Purpose The article asks how institutions of local governance affect national efforts to improve accountability to mining communities in Ghana on the use of mineral revenues for development. It contributes to the broader theoretical literature on EITI by clarifying what outcomes, if any, can be directly attributed to the disclosure of royalty payments. Methods and approach This qualitative study employs a case-study analysis of EITI adoption in Ghana, one of the first countries to join the initiative. The article contextualizes local governance institutions and dynamics in relation to the royalty disbursement process. It draws on original field research to analyse their role in impeding the expected benefits of royalty disbursements to mining-affected communities. Findings The research identifies deficiencies in local governance structures and processes as they relate to the use of mineral royalties, but also instances of variation in how officials react to EITI. The range of individual actors, institutions and complex processes on which the subnational disbursement of royalties depends, makes it problematic to attribute the absence of improvements directly to Ghana’s EITI. The findings demonstrate that EITI’s role in participating countries is best understood as facilitative and indirect when addressing development outcomes for mining commu

The global pandemic has not only put global health inequality on display; it has also done the same for food security: nearly one out of five Africans experienced hunger in 2020 – more than double the proportion of any other region. This policy brief highlights the current situation, noting countries with a high prevalence of food insecurity as well as countries where large numbers of people experience hunger. We note the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food security as well as the negative consequences of food insecurity from a nutritional perspective. Before looking forward, this policy brief examines the historical context of social policies and safety nets, using a selection of contemporary case studies. It concludes with recommendations for protecting the right to food for all people at all times (e.g., investing in better data, best fit design, expanding coverage, moving beyond quantity to quality, nutritional diversity and food safety) as well as enabling food system change (e.g., enhancing resilience, transforming systems).","[0.0, 0.0, 0.05403107, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.47758886, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00065411]",economy,"[1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

Climate Justice Communication: This theme consists of two chapters, one largely theoretical piece, drawing on previous studies to suggest future directions for research, and one applied case study. Both chapters discuss the situations of Indigenous peoples and illuminate challenges of communicating climate justice across diverse communicational and geographical contexts. Roosvall and Tegelberg (Chapter 22) detail how attention to economic, cultural, and political justice must be combined with attention to geographical scope, suggesting that future research consider how geographical scales are combined or disconnected in climate change reporting for diverse types of media. In Chapter 23, Yagodin applies a pluralistic climate justice approach, which includes justice for nature, and zooms in on Russian climate change reporting. He examines how calls for climate justice were largely excluded from journalistic, but not NGO, framings of the 2016 anthrax outbreak on the Yamal peninsula.

Central to the SIB model is the question of evaluation and the method to be used in determining program outcomes and investor returns. In the United States, the randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been the dominant method. However, this has not been without controversy. Some SIB practitioners and investors have argued that, while this may be the perfect tool, the need to grow the SIB market demands a more pragmatic approach. Drawing from a three-year study of SIBs, and informed by Science and Technology Studies (STS)-inspired work on valuation and the social life of methods, the article explores RCTs as both a valuation technology central to SIB design and the object of a micropolitics of valuation which has impeded market growth. It is the relationship between, and the politics of, evaluation and valuation that is a key lesson of the SIB experiment and an important insight for future research on “social investment” and other settings where methods are constitutive of financial value.","[0.0226807, 0.0, 0.00629232, 0.00207371, 0.04334537, 0.02166478, 0.0237667, 0.01123765, 0.0, 0.02708284, 0.01169773, 0.00695693]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 7.64747297e-06

However, empirical analysis of the reintegration outcomes for survivors remains limited in the African context. Hence, this paper aims to examine the challenges and opportunities of reintegration assistance programs for survivors of human trafficking in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on qualitative methods of data collection and analysis, this study conducted semi-structured interviews with repatriated women who have accessed reintegration assistance in Nigeria, and data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings The findings suggest that while the reintegration programs might address the procedural aspect of reintegration, the achievement of substantive reintegration remains incomplete. This is because of the structural conditions of the context within which reintegration is supposed to occur. Practical implications There is a need to take seriously the distinction between the reintegration of survivors into a new community or a former community in the design of a regime of care for survivors of human trafficking in Africa. Crucially, the focus on procedural reintegration should not also divert attention away from the structural conditions and reforms needed to ensure survivors achieve substantive reintegration. Originality/value This paper contributes to the limited literature on life after trafficking and demonstrates the strengths and limitations of reintegration programs as a regime of care for survivors of human trafficking.

The paper adopts a strategic-relational approach that recognises the variability in state capacities over time and space. Empirically, it draws upon secondary sources and interviews with stakeholder groups. Our findings reveal the complex nature of CSR and the dynamic, yet resilient, role of state actors in a context of strong state–business interdependence, institutional incompatibility, and fragmented powers across diverse state branches.

However well-intentioned these interventions might be, they nonetheless remain subject to a host of limitations and complications. Recent efforts to combat contemporary slavery are too often sensationalist, self-serving, and superficial and, therefore, end up failing the crucial test of speaking truth to power. The widely held notion that antislavery is one of those rare issues that ""transcends"" politics or ideology is only sustainable because the underlying issues at stake have been constructed and demarcated in a way that minimizes direct challenges to dominant political and economic interests. This must change. By providing an original approach to the underlying issues at stake, Contemporary Slavery will help readers understand the political practices that have been concealed beneath the popular rhetoric and establishes new conversations between scholars of slavery and trafficking and scholars of human rights and social movements.","[0.09832782, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",politics,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

This gave rise to “symbolic efforts … to preserve a sense of meaning and coherence in the face of social changes that they found threatening and confusing. Residents sought to “recall and reaffirm an untainted world that existed nowhere but in their imaginations. These conclusions are fascinating and prescient, and have led many of us since then to probe legal perceptions in the face of growing normative pluralism. Much like the study of residents of Sander County in Engel’s “Oven Bird’s Song, Carole Greenhouse writes about perceptions of disputes and litigation in a small town she calls Hopewell in Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town (1986). In Greenhouse’s preface, she discusses her own assumptions going into her study. She writes: I went to Hopewell in September 1973 to study dispute settlement in an American community, and my assumption, or hope, was that the role of the court in the social fabric of a town would be thrown into relief if the community was in the process of change. The rest of the book should make it clear why such a legal study was not possible in this community and also how it is that one can begin a study of an American community by looking for conflict and end by considering a person’s relationship to God.

Recently a number of humanitarian and activist organizations, including Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Sea-Watch, and WatchTheMed, have organized to aid migrants in distress at sea using surveillance technologies, ranging from drones to GPS. By doing so, they presented a challenge to the European border surveillance regime. In dialogue with the concept of countersurveillance, this paper introduces the concepts of humanitarian surveillance and human rights surveillance and deploys them to examine and categorize the activities of MOAS, MSF, Sea-Watch, and WatchTheMed. Humanitarian surveillance narrowly focuses on aiding victims of surveillance without problematizing the logic and hierarchies of surveillance, while human rights surveillance operates as a form of countersurveillance; it aims to protect and advance the human rights of victims of surveillance and expose human rights violations committed by authorities through opposing the hierarchies of surveillance. The paper shows how civilian groups incorporate elements of humanitarian and human rights surveillance in their activities at varying levels and discusses the extent to which they challenge the European border surveillance regime.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.47066114]",politics,"[9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01

It identifies three elements that played determinant roles in the articulation of the event: the politics of equality enacted by migrants, the ethics of hospitality and witnessing enacted by the Greek activists and host populations and the sacredness of the event. Critically engaging with the theories of Rancière, Derrida, Agamben and Durkheim, this paper demonstrates how these elements encountered and how their encounter helped migrants to achieve rights, albeit limited and temporary. Moving beyond the particularity of the event, this paper also highlights the event’s importance for migrant politics in times of austerity, and increased surveillance and racism against migrants. Despite its limited and temporary success, the event demonstrates how a politics of equality, ethical openness and respect for human life can form the basis of true cosmopolitan universality. The event also demonstrates how cosmopolitan universality is constructed from below by the migrants, who despite their undocumented status, engaged in an act of citizenship to demand equality.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.41045526]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Alt- hough borders have always been the spaces where individuals are sorted from each other, the database technologies extend this process of sorting to every- where within the EU. The developments in the database and biometrics technology have made it possible to identify people automatically and to reach their records even long after they have entered the EU. Digitization and diffusion of the borders will affect the already disadvantaged segments of the population, such as undocumented migrants, asylum seekers and ordinary travellers, in a negative way. These categories are now put under continual surveillance as if they are potential criminals or terrorists. Yet, the diffusion of the borders with digital technologies should not mean that the localized controls at the external borders have lost their significance. In fact, with the EUROSUR, now the territorial controls have also intensified. The EUROSUR will survey the external EU borders with sophisticated surveillance systems, including manned and un- manned aerial vehicles and satellites, in order prevent irregular migrants from reaching the EU. This paper is divided into three main sections. In the discussion that follows, the paper draws on the surveillance and border studies literature to develop a con- ceptual framework for understanding the digital borders. Second, the paper ex- amines the new EU surveillance mechanisms in detail and their effects on dif- ferent groups. The final section concludes by summarizing the arguments of the paper and discussing the consequences of digital sorting on European citizenship.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00867149, 0.0, 0.00099139, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.44833827]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

Both campaigns are examples of grassroots international labor solidarity, where organizers sought to build international solidarity through member mobilization and a focus on the power of workers to engage in solidarity actions. I examine how these union activists organized within their unions, and how their organizational differences and the ideological and political contexts they organized within shaped their successes and limitations.

Of the 440 TB patients (62.5% men, 51% foreign born, 9.6% with HIV infection) 65% were initially hospitalized. The total treatment duration was 210 (+/-108) days on average. Only 75% of the patients who were treated by a total of 410 hospital and primary care physicians were treated with standard regimens according to guidelines. 3 patients were treatment failures; 13 relapsed (5.1% of the 257 patients reexamined in 1995). Possible causes for relapses were poor patient compliance due to alcoholism, homelessness, drug addiction, psychiatric disorders; prescription errors with inadequate treatment durations, concurrent AIDS disease, or use of a three-drug combination despite primary drug resistance. In 4 of the relapse patients and in all 3 treatment failures, secondary drug resistance developed under treatment. 5 of these 7 patients were treated initially only with a fixed three-drug regimen (Rifater). The relatively high INH resistance rate (8.6%) and relapse rate (5.1%) in the Canton of Zurich renders the use of a four-drug combination therapy necessary. In the outpatient maintenance phase, more effort must be devoted to ensuring patient compliance and adherence to a proper treatment duration. This should be documented by a standardized questionnaire at 6 or 12 months after initiation of therapy. In high risk patients in particular, home care visits by a TB nurse in addition to consultations by primary care physicians are ne

So, how do forms of social difference shape the adoption of SHSs in sub-Saharan Africa? To address this question, this study conducts a systematic review of the academic literature on SHSs in sub-Saharan Africa. Our findings indicate that gender intersects with age, geographical location, and other inequalities to shape the adoption of SHSs. The adoption of SHSs may reproduce the structures that determine power and resource allocation at the local level. Because of various factors, including decision-making power, control over resources, gendered division of labour, and gendered domestic space, the uptake of SHSs has implications for how and when women perform household chores. From a Weberian perspective, the adoption of SHSs in several communities in sub-Saharan Africa is also grounded in class-based and status-based explanations. SHSs are powerful forces for the reproduction of power relations as well as vehicles for the reconfiguration of social hierarchies. Culture is a double-edged sword that both fosters the adoption of SHSs and hinders that adoption. Based on our analysis, we suggest opportunities for future research.","[0.03054276, 0.00083086, 0.0, 0.03397695, 0.00260244, 0.0, 0.01750924, 0.00430127, 0.00909518, 0.0, 0.00540677, 0.00554044]",women,"[4.70639470e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01

M. Coetzee’s oeuvre that makes explicit references to the context of late-apartheid South Africa. Strictly speaking, the novel is about the challenges of overcoming the iron logic of the age, i.e. the very rationality of the apartheid regime. Thus, the novel has important implications not only for the context within which it is situated but also for the struggles that have since shaped South Africa. This paper attempts to provide a dialectical alternative to poststructuralist and Levinasian readings of the novel. It examines the ethics and politics of love and freedom in the novel and follows the itinerary of these concepts to the question of forgiveness. Specifically, I argue that Mrs. Curren, the narrator and heroine of the story, can be understood through the lens of the Hegelian Unhappy Consciousness, that is, as the “dual” consciousness of mastery and slavery. As such, she is obsessed with questions of freedom (mastery and slavery), forgiveness, love, evil, and salvation, among others. Through the mediation of its Unhappy Consciousness, in fact, the novel renders possible the transition from the nightmarish real of late-apartheid to a real figuration of a different future.","[0.0433334, 0.00058068, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01453651, 0.00021173, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00335045]",politics,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

It examines these conditions in relation to governance challenges faced by indigenous peoples, for whom access to fisheries and tenure rights to land and waters are critical components of their livelihoods. The titling of large swaths of land under a collective property regime, combined with uncontrolled immigration by non-indigenous, campesino settlers, and the weakening of traditional forms of authority have generated a scenario where conflicts are frequent, while negotiation—when it occurs—often expresses historical injustice and power imbalances between the state and indigenous peoples. What institutional impediments currently affect the governability of indigenous, small-scale fisheries along the Caribbean Coast, and how can they be addressed? In order to answer this question, the paper examines three factors that influence the structural position of indigenous peoples with regard to fisheries: changes in tenure regimes, tensions between hierarchical versus decentralized governance modes, and the consequences of legally fragmented, “mosaic” governance patterns. The paper draws theoretical insights from the literature on interactive governance and legal pluralism to propose that in a scenario of contested entitlements, actions for improving self-governance and mobilizing agency offer potential for improving governability and respect for indigenous human rights.","[0.02860861, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07857062, 0.0, 0.00385483, 0.0, 0.02991232, 0.0, 0.02963159, 0.0364422]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

The first was characterized by a cultural consciousness enabled by Enlightenment thought but articulated as ""Eastern"" culture; the second, nationalism's power in mobilizing the population, based on a notion of the nonpassive ""Oriental""; and the final, the hegemonic resolution of the non-Western nation with the liberal state and the postcolonial state's entry into Western modernity. Chatterjee claimed general relevance for his theoretical framework and this is what generates this analysis. The theme of this essay is a dual one: it is, one, an account of Jagan's nationalist discourse during the initial period of Guyana's trek from colonial territory to postcolonial state through, two, a critical adaptation of Chatterjee's framework. One of the most important aspects of the critique of Nationalist Thought and the Colonial World involves the ontology of culture, an element that is central to Chatterjee's argument. What I hope to produce is a way of reading the difference between the general framework of Nationalist Thought, which takes India as its case study, and the particular manifestation of Guyanese nationalist thought. That is, by way of metaphor, the difference between a title like Towards Freedom and Forbidden Freedom. One of the tasks of postcolonial theory is to locate agency on the part of the colonial subjects, to find a way for those figures to make visible their subjectivity.

In 1998, for instance, the Turkish Constitutional Court dissolved an AKP predecessor, the Welfare Party, and annulled its coalition government with a far-right party, on the grounds that Welfare threatened secularism.

Therefore, this study was intended to investigate water, sanitation and hygienic (WASH) behaviour, protective equipment use and their disposal practices among Bangladeshi residents amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the study aims, data were collected mainly via an online survey and analysed through a set of statistical tools including T test, one-way ANOVA and principal component analysis (PCA). This study found that almost 89.80% of the respondents reported to know about the COVID-19 and its preventive measures. WASH status of the respondents is found quite good, where 94.60% stated to have available potable water, 99% have improved toilet facilities, 95% wash their hands via soap, and 79.80% clean their house and toilets by antiseptic solutions properly. Moreover, nearly 94.50% and 54.80% people reported to use face mask and hand gloves, respectively, but the disposal practice of these protective equipment is inappropriate. More than 50% of people reported disposing of their used mask, gloves and tissue with other household wastes, which is alarming for public health and environmental perspective.

In this paper,we argue that these border agreements have increasingly resulted in a changing experience of sovereign power for those crossing the border. This is demonstrated through a discussion of: the major border policies between Canada and the US since 11 September 2001, developed under the influence of US hegemony; how these policies perpetrate a generalised state of exception; and how these policies affect refugees,migrants, and citizens. Reading Agamben’s insights from a sociological perspective, we argue that the presumption of security-through-surveillance erodes border crossers’ human rights, and that some people – those from disadvantaged race/class backgrounds – aremore affected than others by the implementation of the evolving border regime.

Our findings indicate that the origins of current militarization and deportation efforts in the Eastern Mediterranean (such as the EUROSUR system and the 'Hot Spots' approach) can be traced back to the Western Mediterranean and that they have been gradually expanded eastwards. Finally, the paper also demonstrates how militarization and deportation initiatives were implemented jointly by sovereign entities (the EU and member states), and by doing so it addresses the recent debates on the status of sovereignty.

This inner city community, like communities worldwide, has experienced a reduction or closure in access to education, support services, and in some cases, a change in or loss of income, job, and food security. Using quantitative survey items ( N = 992), we examined what differences in family circumstances, for mothers and fathers of young children aged 0–5 living in Tower Hamlets, during March 2020 to November 2020, were associated with their mental health status. We measure parental mental health using symptoms of depression (self-report: Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale: PHQ-8), symptoms of anxiety levels (self-report: General Anxiety Disorder: GAD-7), and perceptions of direct loneliness. We find parental mental health difficulties are associated with low material assets (financial security, food security, and children having access to outside space), familial assets (parents time for themselves and parent status: lone vs. cohabiting), and community assets (receiving support from friends and family outside the household). South Asian parents and fathers across ethnicities were significantly more likely to experience mental health difficulties, once all other predictors were accounted for.

For accuracy, we implemented a stacking regression for the clinical data and web search queries. The stacked regression of ARIMA (1,0,8) for clinical data and boost with support vector machine for web data formed the best model for forecasting vaccination speed in the US. The stacked regression provided a more accurate forecast. These results can help governments and policymakers predict vaccine demand and finance relevant programs.","[0.00263677, 0.0, 0.05591259, 0.0, 0.00400079, 0.0049185, 0.05046778, 0.00061518, 0.0, 0.00055747, 0.01667953, 0.0]",covid,"[1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06

Some studies also suggest that there are ethnic inequalities in healthcare use and care quality among people with multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs). The aims of this review are to (1) identify and describe the literature that reports on ethnicity and healthcare use and care quality among people with MLTCs in the UK and (2) examine how healthcare use and/or care quality for people with MLTCs compares across ethnic groups. We registered the protocol on PROSPERO (CRD42020220702). We searched the following databases up to December 2020: ASSIA, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science core collection. Reference lists of key articles were also hand-searched for relevant studies. The outcomes of interest were patterns of healthcare use and care quality among people with MLTCs for at least one minoritised ethnic group, compared to the White majority population in the UK. Two reviewers, L.B. and B.H., screened and extracted data from a random sample of studies (10%). B.H. independently screened and extracted data from the remaining studies.

This has raised concern about the importance of widening participation (WP) for care-experienced young people (CEYP). However, CEYP are often institutionally stigmatised and this could be worsened by WP interventions that are framed by deficit discourses. Weaving together social pedagogies and social justice theories, the article aims to reframe WP away from deficit discourses through recognition of the systemic, structural and cultural inequalities that most CEYP must navigate to access formal education. We introduce the concept of the relational navigator , in which a pedagogical relationship enables the navigator to ‘pilot’ through complex systems and transitional processes in collaboration with, and through ‘walking alongside’, the CEYP with respect to their lived contexts and experiences. This article draws from the reflections of WP navigators situated in two small-scale WP projects, one in an English museum and the other in an Australian university. Our analysis of the reflections of the WP project navigators is offered as a preliminary exploration of the potential the relational navigator as a way to shift deficit discourses and work towards a reframing of WP through a social pedagogical perspective.","[0.01032418, 0.00086753, 0.0, 0.00187347, 0.02607196, 0.03902788, 0.0, 0.00183287, 0.0, 0.0, 0.08559626, 0.0]",community_service,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

Background: Little is known about the place based impacts of the pandemic on families with young children. We describe the living circumstances of families with children under five or expecting a baby living in Tower Hamlets during the Coronavirus pandemic in 2020, and then examine the relative importance of household characteristics such as ethnicity and household income for adverse impacts on survey respondents, as seen in mental health outcomes. Method: a community survey sample recruited with support from the local council comprised 75% mothers/pregnant women, 25% fathers/partners of pregnant women. Reflecting the borough population, 35 percent were White British or Irish and 36 percent were Bangladeshi, and the remainder were from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. Adopting an assets based approach, we describe material, familial and community assets using three household income bands and seven ethnic groups. We then use regressions to identify which assets were most important in mitigating adversity. Results: We find that material assets (income, employment, food insecurity, housing quality) were often insecure and in decline but familial assets (home caring practices, couple relationships) were largely sustained. Community assets (informal support, service provision) were less available or means of access had changed.

These experiences likely differ by the type of stakeholder involved (women, their support persons, birth attendants, policy-makers), the experience itself (low-risk birth, transfer to hospital, previous deliveries), and by the health system within which home birth occurs (e.g., high-resource versus low- and middle-resource countries). Research evidence of stakeholders’ perspectives of home birth could usefully inform personal and policy decisions about choosing and providing home birth, but the current literature is fragmented and its breadth is not fully understood. We conducted a systematic scoping review to understand how the research literature on stakeholders’ perspectives of home birth is characterized in terms of populations, settings and identified issues, and what potential gaps exist in the research evidence. A range of electronic, web-based and key informant sources of evidence were searched. Located references were assessed, data extracted, and descriptively analyzed using robust methods. Our analysis included 460 full reports. Findings from 210 reports of studies in high-resource countries suggested that research with fathers and same-sex partners, midwives, and vulnerable populations and perspectives of freebirth and transfer to hospital could be synthesized. Gaps in primary research exist with respect to family members, policy makers, and those living in rural and remote locations. A further 250 reports of studies in low- and middle-resource countries suggested evidence for syntheses related to fathers and other family members, policy makers, and other health care providers and examination of issues related to emergency transfer t

The importance of sociohistorical context when examining sexual orientations and identity development is considered in explaining why emerging adults increasingly question binary constructs of both sexuality and gender, and more often adopt fluid and shifting identities, compared to older generations. New psychological frameworks accounting for these more diverse ways of approaching sexual identity and gender identity are reviewed. Nevertheless, health disparities among sexual minority emerging adults still prevail, and the minority stress framework is utilized to explain and understand the underlying reasons.

Methods 9,789 adolescents (51% female) aged 17 years from the UK-wide Millennium Cohort Study, with data on self-identified sexual- and ethnic-identities. Adolescents were grouped into White-Heterosexual, White sexual minority (White-SM), ethnic minority (EM)-heterosexual, and ethnic- and sexual minority (EM-SM). Mental health (e.g., self-reported psychological distress, doctor-diagnosed depression, attempted suicide, victimisation), general health (self-rated health, chronic illness, BMI) and a range of health-related behaviours (e.g., smoking, substance use) were assessed by questionnaires. Associations between dual identities and outcomes were analysed using logistic and linear regression (adjusted for sex and parental income). Results Sexual minorities (White:18% and ethnic minority:3%) had increased odds for mental ill-health and attempted suicide, with higher odds in White-SM than EM-SM. Compared to White-heterosexuals, White-SM and EM-SM had higher odds for psychological distress (OR 3.47/2.24 for White-SM/EM-SM respectively), and emotional problems (OR 3.17/1.65). White-SM and EM-SM had higher odds for attempted suicide (OR 2.78/2.02), self-harm (OR 3.06/1.52), and poor sleep quality (OR 1.88/1.67).

A questionnaire was administered to a sample of 103 cohabiting couples ( N = 206) in the United States, who were randomly selected from a nationally representative survey panel. Dyadic analysis using actor–partner interdependence models with latent outcomes revealed that internal discrepancies between actual and idealized closeness were associated with poorer relationship quality for both individuals and their partners.

Objective We summarize existing studies on the well-being and development of children conceived through MAR. Materials and methods Review of existing studies. Results Children conceived through MAR are at increased risk of adverse birth outcomes such as low birthweight and preterm delivery compared to naturally conceived children. The higher rates of multiple births amongst MAR-conceived children continue to represent an important driving factor behind these disparities. Reassuringly, elective single embryo transfer (eSET)—which is associated with more favourable pregnancy outcomes among MAR-conceived children—is becoming more common. Despite the early life health disadvantages, the evidence on later life outcomes such as physical, cognitive and psychosocial development is generally reassuring. On average, MAR-conceived children show similar or better outcomes than naturally conceived children. The selected and advantaged socioeconomic characteristics of parents who conceive through MAR are likely to play an important role in explaining why, on average, MAR-conceived children perform better than naturally conceived children—particularly in terms of cognitive outcomes. In contrast, there is some evidence pointing to potentially increased risks of mental health problems among MAR-conceived children.

This research utilizes the second wave of the ‘Sexual and Emotional Life of Youths’ (SELFY) data set to compare the health behaviors of sexual minority (SM) and heterosexual college students in Italy. Results showed that bisexual women were more likely than heterosexual women to smoke both 1–7 and 8+ cigarettes per day, get drunk sometimes and often/very often, and use marijuana and/or ecstasy sometimes and often/very often.

This article addresses the discordances between lived temporalities and existing theorisations of participatory methodologies. It takes participatory research with lone child migrants as a particularly rich case to think with, given the proliferation of contradictory and often punitive applications of time these young people encounter in their interactions with migration and welfare regimes. The core argument developed is that unless temporality is given due theoretical and methodological attention, aims of contesting and unsettling inequities through participatory research will have limited success and can wind up reproducing exclusions and oppressions. In response to these critiques, the paper temporalizes participatory research through three reconstructions: working with and against time, de-centring shared time and collectivising the time of participatory research.","[0.01690881, 0.0, 0.00138333, 0.00161376, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00194497, 0.03582372, 0.0, 0.0, 0.03444438, 0.07685116]",politics,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

Time-use diary surveys are unique in providing a complete chronicle of daily behavior: 24-h continuous records of the populations’ activities, their social context, and their location. We present results from four such surveys, collected in real time from representative UK samples, both before and at three points over the course of the current pandemic. Comparing across the four waves, we find evidence of substantial changes in the UK population’s behavior relating to activities, locations, and social context. We assign different levels of risk to combinations of activities, locations, and copresence to compare risk-related behavior across successive “lockdowns.” We find evidence that during the second lockdown (November 2020), there was an increase in high-risk behaviors relative to the first (starting March 2020). This increase is shown to be associated with more paid work time in the workplace. At a time when capacity is still limited both in respect of immunization and track–trace technology, governments must continue to rely on changes in people’s daily behaviors to contain the spread of COVID-19 and similar viruses.

It employed an iterative mixed-methods approach, conducted in four phases. Using data from Understanding Society: the UK Household Longitudinal Study, Phase 1 explored ethnic variations in the friendship networks of older people using logistic regression analyses. Compared to older white people, older minoritised people’s friendship networks were found to be restricted in size and accessibility. These findings were explored further in Phase 2 using in-depth interviews with older people from minoritised ethnic groups. Community groups were identified as important for protecting against social isolation and loneliness. A mixed-methods systematic review was subsequently conducted to assess whether community-based group interventions reduced social isolation and loneliness in older people, and to uncover their underlying mechanisms. The evidence of effectiveness based on the meta-analyses was unclear, and qualitative comparative analysis was used to understand (non)effective interventions. The most effective interventions were found to adopt cognitive approaches to reducing loneliness, recruit participants with shared characteristics and provide participants with opportunities to connect. In Phase 4, the interviews conducted in Phase 2 were analysed using dialogic/performance analysis to gain an understanding of what older minoritised people consider their needs to be. The findings were used to assess the extent to which the interventions identified as most effective in Phase 3 matched what older people from minoritised ethnic g

Methods The Millennium Cohort Study is a longitudinal study of 19 243 families who had a child born between 2000 and 2002 in the UK. Multilevel growth curve models were applied to examine change in fat mass index (FMI), fat free mass index (FFMI; using the Benn index), and fat mass to fat free mass ratio (FM:FFM), measured using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis, from ages 7 years to 17 years by the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) and household income at baseline. Findings Inequalities in FMI and FM:FFM ratio are evident at age 7 years and widen with age. At age 17 years, adolescents in the most disadvantaged IMD group had FMI 0·57 kg/mB (B=Benn parameter; 95% CI 0·43 to 0·70) higher and FM:FFM ratio 0·037 (95% CI 0·026 to 0·047) higher compared with the most advantaged group.

Fat mass (FM), a more accurate measure of adiposity, and fat-free mass (FFM) are not captured by BMI, but have been shown to track from childhood to adulthood, and be important for cardiovascular health and functional outcomes in later life. It is not clear whether body composition is associated with SEP. We systematically reviewed the association between SEP and body composition in childhood.

We therefore systematically reviewed the literature on the association between life course SEP and body composition in adulthood. A protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42019119937), and the review followed PRISMA guidelines.

Outcomes for LS included symptom duration lasting 4+ weeks (long COVID) and 12+ weeks. Association with of age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, smoking, general and mental health, overweight/obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and asthma was assessed. Results In LS, symptoms impacted normal functioning for 12+ weeks in 1.2% (mean age 20 years) to 4.8% (mean age 63 y) of COVID-19 cases. Between 7.8% (mean age 28 y) and 17% (mean age 58 y) reported any symptoms for 12+ weeks, and greater proportions for 4+ weeks.

These studies did not address whether and, if so, how this effect varies according to the mode of conception. This represents an important knowledge gap, given that conceptions through medically assisted reproduction (MAR) have been increasing rapidly in recent decades, exceeding 5% of live births in some European countries. Drawing on nine waves (2009/2010–2017/2018) of the UK Household Longitudinal Study, we use distributed fixed-effects linear regression models to examine changes in women's mental health before, during, and after natural and MAR conceptions. The results show that the mental health of women who conceived naturally improved around the time of conception and then gradually returned to baseline levels; comparatively, the mental health of women who conceived through MAR declined in the year before pregnancy and then gradually recovered. The findings also indicate that women's happiness decreased both two years and one year before an MAR conception and then increased above the baseline in the year of pregnancy. We further show that the deterioration in mental health and subjective well-being before an MAR conception affects both partners, which could be part of a longer process in which the partners potentially suffer from stress related not solely to the MAR treatments themselves but also to the experience of subfertility.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.08747956, 0.15486403, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02573323, 0.06160107, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",women,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06

An increasing body of research has demonstrated that LGBTI+ people face health inequalities, which are due to the pernicious effects of social stigma. A more accurate understanding of the quality of care received and perceived by this population represents a fundamental social issue and a central focus for reducing health inequalities. Indeed, many LGBTI+ people still avoid healthcare contexts for fear of discrimination from healthcare providers. On the other hand, many healthcare providers still have little knowledge about the specific health needs of this population. A further issue concerns the structural/institutional stigma embedded within some health organizations due to the existence of laws and regulations that not guarantee full equality for LGBTI+ populations. The focus of this thematic issue is the experience of LGBTI+ people within healthcare contexts.

This paper explores a diverse range of adult stakeholders' understandings of the care of SCMs, filling an important gap in understanding how care is conceptualized by those working in often complex and contradictory positions. Drawing on the care literature, this study focuses on 15 qualitative semistructured interviews with state and nonstate adult stakeholders in England (e.g., social work, law, police, and NGO workers). We argue that stringent immigration practices, policies, and bureaucratic and structural challenges undoubtedly present personal tensions and professional constraints for those whose role is meant to foreground “care.” Importantly, when taking into account a range of different perspectives, roles, and responsibilities across professions and sectors, our respondents were constrained in varying ways or had varying room to maneuver within their institutional contexts. Our analysis suggests that amid a hostile immigration environment, care connections with and between SCMs are treated with mistrust and are unstable over space and time. We argue that how care is conceptualized and experienced is mutually constituted by hostile policies and procedures, adult stakeholders' roles within or out-with those systems, and their personal values and perspectives. It is within this space where constraints, enablers, and resistances play out. Care is subjectively experienced, and care relationships are open to potential (dis)connection across space and time.","[0.01926374, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00171935, 0.0, 0.01200435, 0.18755336, 0.03140771]",community_service,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01

We wanted to know what remotely delivered befriending, social support and low intensity psychosocial interventions may help to alleviate social isolation and loneliness and how they work. Methods : We followed a systematic ‘review of reviews’ approach. Searches of 11 databases from the fields of health, social care, psychology and social science were undertaken during April 2020. Reviews meeting our PICOS criteria were included if they focussed on the evaluation of remote interventions to reduce levels of social isolation or loneliness in adults aged 50+ and were critically appraised using AMSTAR2. Narrative synthesis was used at a review and study level to develop a typology of intervention types and their effectiveness. Intervention Component Analysis (ICA) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) were used at a study level to explore the characteristics of successful interventions. Results : We synthesised evidence from five systematic reviews and 18 primary studies. Remote befriending, social support and low intensity psychosocial interventions took the form of: (i) supported video-communication; (ii) online discussion groups and forums; (iii) telephone befriending; (iv) social networking sites; and (v) multi-tool interventions.

Despite autism being stereotypically associated with lack of social motivation, an autistic community has been described briefly in the literature but is not well understood. Autistic community connectedness (ACC) may play a role in promoting wellbeing for autistic people. This qualitative study involved interviewing autistic individuals (N = 20) in-person, via a video-based platform, a text-based platform, or over email to investigate ACC. Critical grounded theory tools were used to collect and analyse the data. There were three elements of ACC: belongingness, social connectedness, and political connectedness. Belongingness referred to the sense of similarity that autistic people experienced with each other. Social connectedness referred to specific friendship participants formed with other autistic people. Political connectedness referred to a connectedness to the political or social equality goals of the autistic community. Participants described the benefits of ACC as being increased self-esteem, a sense of direction, and a sense of community not experienced elsewhere. Lack of connectedness involved ambivalence with an autism identity and/or feelings of internalised stigma.

I show that in trying to convince their partners to take leave, both women draw on gendered scripts, either in how the interaction is managed, or by the discourses that are drawn on. Moreover, fathers’ work context strongly mediates negotiations, as all participants judge this to trump other considerations regarding leave, reinforcing men’s attachment to the workplace.

This article surveys the kinds of dynamic simulation models that have been used as decision support tools and to forecast the potential impacts of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). We developed the Values in Viral Dispersion model, which emphasizes the role of human factors and social networks in viral spread and presents scenarios to guide policy responses. Methods: An agent-based model of COVID-19 was developed with individual agents able to move between 3 states (susceptible, infectious, or recovered), with each agent placed in 1 of 7 social network types and assigned a propensity to comply with NPIs (quarantine, contact tracing, and physical distancing). A series of policy questions were tested to illustrate the impact of social networks and NPI compliance on viral spread among (1) populations, (2) specific at-risk subgroups, and (3) individual trajectories. Results: Simulation outcomes showed large impacts of physical distancing policies on number of infections, with substantial modification by type of social network and level of compliance. In addition, outcomes on metrics that sought to maximize those never infected (or recovered) and minimize infections and deaths showed significantly different epidemic trajectories by social network type and among higher or lower at-risk age cohorts. Conclusions: Although dynamic simulation models have important limitations, which are discussed, these decision support tools should be a key resource for navigating the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and can help local and national decision makers determine where, when, and how to invest resources.","[0.03557004, 0.0, 0.10967409, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07843194, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",covid,"[9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06

Yet the success glosses over the diversity of the Cuban diaspora, not only in Miami, but in the United States more widely, as well as internationally. The first wave of emigres, who are known as “exiles, “ have for decades campaigned for a watertight embargo against Cuba and have on principle refused to visit their homeland. By contrast, more recent Cuban emigres, who have left the island since the economic crisis of the 1990s and who are less affluent and have less political clout, have forged cross-border transnational links with kin and friends on the island. In this article, building on Mannheim’s thesis about the long-lasting impact that early-life experiences may have, we show that diasporic Cubans who left Cuba with shared experiences and then settled in the United States or Spain adapted similarly, and relate to Cuba in similar ways, and differently from Cubans who emigrated at other points in time with different pre-migration lived experiences. Specifically, we compare and contrast two historically grounded generations in the United States and in Spain in terms of labor market insertion, political incorporation, and linguistic and cultural acculturation in the two host countries. We thereby illustrate the explanatory power of our historically grounded thesis of diasporic generation formations that we elucidated in the Introduction. The article shows how historically grounded pre-migration experiences continue to shape and mold the ways in which immigrants relate to their homeland from abroad, in ways that neither the assimilationist nor the transnational framework can account for.

We investigate whether externalising and internalising problems are associated with problematic drinking in mid-adulthood, and whether potential associations are modified by age, sex and cohort. Methods The National Child Development Study (NCDS58, n = 17,633) and 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70, n = 17,568) recruited new-borns in Great Britain in a single week in 1958 and 1970. Mental health was assessed with the Rutter Behaviour Questionnaire at ages 7, 11, and 16 in NCDS58 and ages 5, 10 and 16 in BCS70. Problematic drinking was measured with the CAGE questionnaire at age 33 in NCDS58 and age 34 in BCS70, and the AUDIT scale at age 44/45 in NCDS58 and age 46 in BCS70. Latent scores of externalising and internalising problems were added chronologically into lagged logistic regression models. Results Externalising and internalising problems were associated in opposite directions with problematic drinking in mid-adulthood. Externalising was a risk factor (OR [95% CI] ranging from 1.06 [1.03, 1.10] to 1.11 [1.07, 1.15] for different ages), and internalising was a protective factor (OR [95% CI] ranging from 0.95 [0.92, 0.99] to 0.90 [0.86, 0.94] for different ages). Associations between early life mental health and mid-adulthood problematic drinking did not differ by developmental timing but were stronger in males. Conclusion Our study provides new insights on links of externalising and internalising difficulties with alcohol use and has implications for public policy in the UK.","[0.00116422, 0.00353382, 0.01813745, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.11208062, 0.02953074, 0.0, 0.00174063, 0.0, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[1.0000000e-06 1.0000000e-06 1.0000000e-06 4.0302293e-06 9.9999900e-01

For LBGTQ+ research, there are similar barriers, with the need for health research projects that support community-led projects and centre LGBTQ+ voices through their methods. This presentation frames research methods as a social justice issue, addressing the value of community members as academic researchers; it seeks to highlight additional ways in which community involvement increases trust in both research processes and outcomes. The included examples are sub-projects and methods that are part of two distinct LGBTQ+/community-led PhD projects using either a multi-study or mixed methods approach; as such the discussion is focused on their use of qualitative methods. Coming from a social psychology perspective, themes are related to plurisexual emerging adults’ parenthood desires and plans and a biomedical study on LGBTQ+ pregnancy and parenthood, with recommendations that are transferable to other health topics. Focusing on the primary example, the presentation discusses the benefits of engaging LGBTQ+ community members assist on data processing and meaning-making while building qualitative research skills. A case study based on this postgraduate-undergraduate mentoring scheme, proposes a purposeful approach to encouraging community-led research as part of capacity building efforts for undergraduates, within and beyond academia.

These experiences likely differ by the type of stakeholder involved (women, their support persons, birth attendants, policy-makers), the experience itself (low-risk birth, transfer to hospital, previous deliveries), and by the health system within which home birth occurs (e.g. high-resource versus low- and middle-resource countries). Research evidence of stakeholders’ perspectives of home birth could usefully inform personal and policy decisions about choosing and providing home birth, but the current literature is fragmented and its breadth is not fully understood. We conducted a systematic scoping review to understand how the research literature on stakeholders’ perspectives of home birth is characterized in terms of populations, settings and identified issues, and what potential gaps exist in the research evidence. A range of electronic, web-based and key informant sources of evidence were searched. Located references were assessed, data extracted and analysed using robust methods. Our analysis included 387 full reports. Findings from 181 reports of studies in high-resource countries suggested that research with fathers, midwives and vulnerable populations and perspectives of freebirth and transfer to hospital could be synthesized, but gaps in primary research exist with respect to family members, policy makers, and those living in rural and remote locations. A further 206 reports of studies in low- and middle-resource countries suggested evidence for syntheses related to fathers and other family members, policy makers and other health care providers, and examination of issues related to emergency transfer to hospital, rural and remote home b

However, parents who undergo MAR to conceive have, on average, advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds which could compensate for the negative effects of being born LBW. Previous studies have not analysed whether the negative effects of LBW are attenuated among MAR conceived children. Methods We draw on the UK Millennium Cohort Study (sweeps 1–6) which contains a sub-sample of (N = 396) MAR-conceived children. The dependent variable measures cognitive ability at around ages 3, 5, 7, 11 and 14. We examine the cognitive development of four groups of children: MAR-conceived low birthweight (MAR LBW); MAR-conceived non-low birthweight (MAR NLBW); naturally conceived low birthweight (NC LBW); naturally conceived non-low birthweight (NC NLBW). We estimate the two following linear regression models for each sweep: (i) a baseline model to examine the unadjusted association between cognitive development and low birthweight by mode of conception; and (ii) a model adjusted by socio-demographic family characteristics.

Most hospitals depend on time-consuming manual audits to monitor clinicians’ prescribing. But much of the information needed could be sourced from electronic health records (EHRs). Objectives To develop an informatics methodology to analyse characteristics of hospital AMS practice using routine electronic prescribing and laboratory records. Methods Feasibility study using electronic prescribing, laboratory and clinical coding records from adult patients admitted to six specialities at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK (September 2017–August 2018). The study involved: (i) a review of AMS standards of care; (ii) their translation into concepts measurable from commonly available EHRs; and (iii) a pilot application in an EHR cohort study (n = 61679 admissions). Results We developed data modelling methods to characterize antimicrobial use (antimicrobial therapy episode linkage methods, therapy table, therapy changes). Prescriptions were linked into antimicrobial therapy episodes (mean 2.4 prescriptions/episode; mean length of therapy 5.8 days), enabling several actionable findings. For example, 22% of therapy episodes for low-severity community-acquired pneumonia were congruent with prescribing guidelines, with a tendency to use broader-spectrum antibiotics.

Minority stress theory predicts that health of sexual minorities is predicated on the social environment. As the social environment improves, exposure to stress would decline and health outcomes would improve. We assessed how stress, identity, connectedness with the LGBT community, and psychological distress and suicide behavior varied across three distinct cohorts of sexual minority people in the United States. Using a national probability sample recruited in 2016 and 2017, we assessed three a priori defined cohorts of sexual minorities we labeled the pride (born 1956-1963), visibility (born 1974-1981), and equality (born 1990-1997) cohorts. We found significant and impressive cohort differences in coming out milestones, with members of the younger cohort coming out much earlier than members of the two older cohorts. But we found no signs that the improved social environment attenuated their exposure to minority stressors-both distal stressors, such as violence and discrimination, and proximal stressors, such as internalized homophobia and expectations of rejection. Psychological distress and suicide behavior also were not improved, and indeed were worse for the younger than the older cohorts. These findings suggest that changes in the social environment had limited impact on stress processes and mental health for sexual minority people.

In this study, we analyse national survey data to interrogate the role Britain’s best-known celebrity scientists David Attenborough, Brian Cox, Richard Dawkins and Stephen Hawking may have played in changing public views of evolution, as well as the role of two creationists: Ken Ham and Harun Yahya. We investigate how well known these public figures are, what their views of religion are perceived to be and, drawing on social identity theory, whether they exert different effects on attitudinal change to evolution among different religious and non-religious publics. Binary logistic regression analysis shows that among Muslim and Pentecostal Christian publics, those familiar with Dawkins as both a scientist and as someone who holds negative views of religion are more likely to have become less accepting of evolution. Conversely, among non-religious publics, Dawkins was the only celebrity scientist associated with higher odds of becoming more accepting of evolution. We suggest that engaging certain religious audiences with the science of evolutionary biology may be more effective when their religious identities are not threatened.","[0.05075669, 0.01468844, 0.01578666, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0232908, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",politics,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

Effective commissioning requires information to indicate which interventions may, or may not, be cost-effective. However, current UK guidance and recent research on the cost-effectiveness of sexual health services provides patchy and fragmented evidence. This study aims systematically to review the evidence available on the cost-effectiveness of OECD-based interventions relevant to UK local authority-commissioned sexual health services. Methods Key informants, bibliographic database searches and reference lists of guidance documents and included studies were searched for potentially relevant research. Guided by key stakeholders, we sought economic evaluations of sexual health interventions within the responsibility of local authorities, and focused in the UK, on contraception and on health promotion, published between 2010 and 2015 in English. Eligible studies were full economic evaluations based in an OECD country. Studies were classified using a specifically developed tool and assessed for methodological risk of bias using one of three design-specific assessment tools. Descriptive frequencies of codes were analysed to provide a ‘map’ of research that informed stakeholder discussions to focus the subsequent synthesis.

Following Sen’s definition of Development as Freedom (Sen 1999), economic empowerment is an essential capability to live the life one has reason to value and can therefore be seen as an outcome of development in its own right. Gender empowerment is also one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and four of the nine targets of this goal relate directly to women’s economic empowerment (UN 2015). As a mechanism for development, there is strong longitudinal evidence that increased inclusion and participation of women in the labour market supports economic growth and development (World Bank 2012; IGC 2015; Kabeer 2012). Full participation of women in labour forces for example is estimated to add multiple percentage points to most national economic growth rates, thus increasing aggregate socio-economic development (UN 2015). Similarly, the McKinsey Global Institute estimates that if all women were able to participate fully in the economy, it would contribute up to US$ 28 trillion or 26 percent of annual global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025 (McKinsey Global Institute 2015). The potential benefits of women’s participation in the labour market underlines that the economic empowerment of women is by no means a zero-sum game: society as a whole stands to gain from it. Investing in women’s economic empowerment is smart economics (Revenga & Shetty 2012). Increasing women’s income leads to greater household spending on education and health (World Bank 2012). It also increases women’s self-esteem, aspirations, and domestic bargaining powers while reducing do

We show changes in behavioral response to social restrictions at three time-points during the pandemic, including across two nationwide lockdowns. Comparing samples across the four waves, we find evidence of substantial changes in the population’s activities, locations and social interactions, which may be interpreted as direct responses to changes in regulations. One of our main motivations was to compare risk-related behavior across the first and second lockdowns. We find suggestive evidence that the second lockdown (recorded late November 2020) was less strictly adhered to than the first (recorded May- June 2020). Holding constant gender, age and social grade, the population spent on average 32 more minutes per day in high risk activities in late November 2020 than in first lockdown. Disaggregating by gender and age group, the difference was found to be statistically significant for all groups, with the exception of those aged 55 and over. Significance statement What do people do during lockdown? This set of data is unique in providing time use diary information in real time on changing behavior in the UK in response to each major change in social restrictions.

In Study 1 (N = 363), heterosexual participants believed voice was a better cue to SO for men than for women, and participants’ belief in the discreteness, immutability, and controllability of ‘gay‐sounding’ voices was correlated with higher avoidant discrimination towards gay‐sounding men. In Study 2 (N = 147), endorsement of essentialist beliefs about voice as a SO cue was associated with self‐perceptions of sounding gay amongst gay men and lesbians.

A sample of sexual minority Dutch emerging adults (N = 675; ages 18–29, M = 21.93 years, SD = 3.20) were recruited through online platforms and flyers. Homophobic violence was expected to be positively associated with suicidal ideation and entrapment. The association between homophobic violence and suicidal ideation was expected to be indirectly linked through entrapment. We explored whether various sources of social belongingness moderated the path between entrapment and suicidal ideation and whether those sources of social belongingness moderated the indirect effect of homophobic violence on suicidal ideation through entrapment. Results showed that homophobic violence and entrapment were positively associated with suicidal ideation and that family belongingness was negatively associated with suicidal ideation. Homophobic violence and suicidal ideation were not indirectly linked through entrapment. The interaction effect between entrapment and family belongingness was significant, suggesting that, on average, the effect of entrapment on suicidal ideation decreased when family belongingness was high.

In drawing out the implications of our argument, we point to time, destitution, and debt as core technologies of the UK’s migration regime, alongside everyday bordering, detention, and deportability. Denying support through NRPF serves to exclude putatively included migrants while normalising conditional approaches to social support.

PrEP is one of the most effective biomedical HIV prevention strategies; however, use among gay and bisexual men remains low within the United States. This study used a national probability sample of gay and bisexual men from three age cohorts of men (18–25, 34–41, and 52–59 years at wave 1) who completed three annual surveys between March 2016 and March 2018 (N at wave 1 = 624). Recruitment occurred through a Gallup dual-frame sampling procedure; results for this study came from eligible individuals who consented to be part of the self-administered online or mailed survey questionnaire. We used descriptive data with sampling weights to understand trends in PrEP familiarity, PrEP attitudes and PrEP use across all three time points. Next, PrEP uptake and discontinuation were assessed among men completing all three surveys and who remained eligible for PrEP at all three time points (N = 181). PrEP familiarity increased considerably between 2016 and 2018 among those eligible for PrEP (from 59.8% from wave 1 to 92.0% at wave 3). Favorable attitudes toward PrEP increased more modestly (from 68.3% at wave 1 to 72.7% at wave 3). While PrEP use increased by 90% between the two time points (from 4.1% in 2016 to 7.8% in 2018), this represented a small percentage of overall uptake among eligible participants across time (6.6%). Among respondents who reported PrEP use at wave 1 or wave 2, 33.3% subsequently discontinued PrEP use at a later wave. Findings indicate modest increases in PrEP use between 2016 and 2018 in a national probability sa

This chapter analyses data from a unique sample of essays written by members of the National Child Development Study (NCDS), the 1958 British birth cohort study, when they were eleven years old in 1969, on the topic of ‘Imagine you are twenty-five…’. It explores girls’ accounts of their imagined future family lives, focusing in particular how they imagined combining paid and domestic work. It aims to highlight children’s writing as a resource for research, and demonstrates that however cursory the task children are asked to undertake, they are creative, constructive and innovative in their responses, and that what they create may tell us something about their current circumstances and social context, and about their capacity for keen, perceptive observation.

Unfortunately, the wrong lessons have been learned from the Uprisings: Europe’s Union and its most powerful states have returned to focusing ‘stability’ understood as a mere lack of change, and to believing that supporting violently authoritarian regimes is an acceptable ‘cost of doing business’ to keep migration in check and to counter terrorism in Europe’s ‘heartland’. After a brief review of the historical context within which Egypt’s current regime emerged, this contribution criticizes the orthodox analytical and policy narratives which represent Egypt as a ‘beacon of stability’ in a turbulent MENA Region, outlining an alternative view which highlights the structural causes of instability in regimes like Egypt’s.

The earliest domesticated alpacas and llamas probably resembled vicuñas and guanacos, their wild counterparts. By 3000 years ago, differences were beginning to emerge in the coats of alpacas and llamas. Dyers, spinners, and weavers learned to exploit these variations to complement and extend the range of possibilities offered through the use of dyed yarns. The evidence from the Siguas and Nasca cultural traditions considered here is both direct and indirect, taking into account textile remains and the depiction of camelids on ceramics. It indicates that all white camelids had emerged before c. AD 500. With Tiwanaku and Wari cultural expansion in the South-Central Andes and Central Andes, requirements for certain fleece types resulted in the production of greater quantities of white and black fleece. Tiwanaku tapestries typically have a dark ground against which reds, blues and blues resonate, with white and yellows providing accents. While some Wari textiles share this use of a dark ground, a considerable number of tapestries and tie-dyed textiles depended on the availability of white and beige to enable pinks, yellows, and other bright hues to shine. Flamingo pink, like millennial pink, became a Wari cultural signifier. To understand this phenomenon, the properties of fleece, including its undyed affordances, must be taken into account as well as the dyestuffs used to enhance the color range.","[0.02142619, 0.00807601, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00853198, 0.00298722, 0.00219938, 0.00784062, 0.003017, 0.0]",politics,"[1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

The rewilding movement contrasts with traditional conservationism in asserting that environmental revitalisation is best achieved through returning designated rural areas to a state broadly approximating that which existed prior to large scale human intervention, as opposed to merely conserving existing plants and fauna. Moreover, a key aspect of this process involves the reintroduction of 'missing species', in the form of apex predators such as Lynx, Boar and Wolf, where the latter are suggested to play a critical role in restoring 'natural' environments, largely through predation to control the activities and numbers of ungulate species whose grazing inhibits the growth of woodland and, hence, the restoration of ecosystems. The paper addresses various political and socio-economic issues raised by proposals for rewilding in the Scottish Highlands, in terms of tensions with traditional conservationism and, not least, the challenges presented to policymakers and publics with respect to predatory species reintroduction, including perceptions of risk to livestock and, indeed, humans. With respect to the latter, more fundamental theoretical questions are also addressed, including the way in which discourses around rewilding have been constructed by both advocates and critics of this phenomenon.","[0.06326598, 0.00065731, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00593222, 0.0, 0.00980913, 0.0, 0.00057999, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00433235]",politics,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01

This piece asserts that overcoming remaining sociological reservations regarding the biological offers considerable potential, in terms of enhancing our theoretical models and understanding of aspects of the social world, potentially offering fresh insights with respect to some perennial issues and concepts.

This condition of mental and emotional fugue, it is argued, has also rendered growing numbers more susceptible to marginal and radicalizing discourses, largely extended and amplified via social media, and not least the emotionally charged overtures of populist politicians.

The first is the relationship between the living and the dead in Andean communities, illustrated through the ritual waki. In San Pablo de Lípez, the dead are associated with fertility and with the coming of the rains, but also require help from the living in the form of offerings of liquids and food. The term waki derives from the Andean vocabulary of reciprocal exchange, which is the second theme of the article. On the basis of historical, linguistic, and ethnographic evidence, it is argued that exchanges are of two types, one involving long-term relationships with an expectation of return, and the other short-term transactions in which a payment completes the deal. These do not coincide with nonmonetary and monetary exchanges. It is also argued that the vocabulary deriving from symmetrical reciprocal exchanges can be employed ideologically to mask the nature of unequal exchange relationships.","[0.01236265, 0.00034945, 0.0011585, 0.00065807, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00730066, 0.00075326, 0.05058306, 0.0094436, 0.01677948, 0.0]",economy,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

Many studies examine electioneering through a framework that distinguishes between programmatic, clientelist and charismatic appeals. Few politicians appeal to people by adopting particular policy positions, the strict sense of ‘programmatic appeals’. However, almost all solicit peoples’ support by stressing their sincere intentions and their abilities to pursue uncontroversial aspects of government, otherwise known as ‘valence appeals’. Parties’ historic records and their locations in government or opposition affect which issues they can claim to own and which they stress in their campaigns. While public policy is all but ubiquitous in African electoral politics, so too is clientelism. Many politicians give voters gifts, in the form of favourable distributions of public service delivery, in-kind goods, and cash. However, few of these gifts constitute contingent exchanges of goods for votes. Instead, political largesse is used to flatter, to impress and to convince voters of politicians’ virtue. In this respect, public policy and clientelism frequently appear in African elections side-by-side. Studies of appeals order studies of political messages, and shed light on how electoral politics affects public policy. However, it also obscures. A separate canon of work studies political discourses in sub-Saharan Africa. One of the most-studied subjects in this strain of the literature is populism. African populisms have been conceived of by some as discourses that unite disparate groups against an elite, and as an electoral strategy that draws together particular constituencies by others.

I revisit the typology proposed by Pippa Norris, which distinguishes between premodern, modern, and postmodern campaigns. This typology, and others like it, homogenizes ground campaigns. Ground campaigns only feature by virtue of their centrality in premodern campaigns and their peripherality in modern and postmodern campaigns. I argue that the prominence of the rally varies across ground campaigns. By trivializing rallies, current typologies obscure this variation between African campaigns and between campaigns in sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world. To accommodate these differences, I propose a schema of campaign ecologies, adapted from Norris’ own, which incorporates a distinct ideal-type: the rally-intensive campaign. This revision internationalizes this hitherto Western-bound typology and may illuminate the features of campaigns in other middle- and low-income countries too. Equally, it throws into relief differences between historic premodern campaigns in Western countries. I contend that rally-intensiveness is a definitive feature of election campaigns from which other features stem. To illuminate such typical features, I study Tanzania, which has the most rally-intensive campaigns in Africa. I draw on ethnographic research and original survey data to identify the four following typical features of the rally-intensive campaign. Local as well as national leaders hold rallies frequently. Local rallies are better attended in aggregate than national ones, and accordingly, campaign contact is direct. Mass meetings dwarf the canvass as a means of campaign contact, and local party networks concentrate their efforts on “producing” rallies.","[0.03329585, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00023645, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02331811, 0.0, 0.00516377, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",politics,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

It argues that Chadema’s extensive party-building enabled it to mobilize on the ground. These organizational developments, as much as elite action, underpinned recent changes in the party system and the opposition’s improved showing in recent elections. Chadema established branches even though many of the prerequisite circumstances typically recognized in the literature were absent. This makes Chadema a deviant case and this deviance has implications for the historical institutionalist literature on party-building. This article complicates Rachel Riedl’s account of state substitution. She links the incorporation or substitution of social actors to different paths of party system institutionalization. This article demonstrates that the character and consequences of state substitution depend upon the balance of power between state and social actors. It also builds on accounts by Adrienne LeBas and others that when social actors are strong, they can endow opposition parties with resources which make branch establishment possible, and when they are weak, they can only act as surrogate party branches. This article illustrates that when social actors are absent from partisan politics, parties have no way to organize except by founding green-site branches.","[0.05447121, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0588252, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",women,"[9.9999900e-01 1.0000000e-06 1.0000000e-06 1.0000000e-06 1.0000000e-06

The literature argues that liberation nationalists discursively construct “liberation” as an ongoing struggle and justify their authoritarian rule until its completion. By recurrently postponing liberation, they extend this justification of authoritarianism. Nonetheless, their claim that the nation is part-way through liberation becomes less plausible over time. Liberation nationalism shares a discursive structure with a parallel class of developmental nationalisms. I analyse the ideology of President Magufuli and CCM in Tanzania. Instead of claiming that the nation is mid-transformation, they constructed the status quo as a corrupt deviation from a past order: “Nyerere’s Tanzania”. They conceived of this past order as a nation dedicated to industrial development which would lead to a transformed future. They advocated rupture with the present, the restoration of the past and the resumption of this transformative journey. Restorationism relieves liberation and developmental nationalisms of the rising rhetorical challenge of claiming that the nation has been on a transformative path since liberation. Therefore, Magufuli and CCM developed a variant upon liberation and developmental nationalisms, which also justifies authoritarianism. Unlike them, it remains rhetorically viable as the moment of liberation or development becomes distant.

For the authors of Stereotypes and Prejudice in Conflict: Representations of Arabs in Israeli Jewish Society, years of research have culminated in a publication that unflinchingly explores such diverse topics as delegitimization tactics and unity as well as the development of perceptions among pre-schoolers. Daniel Bar-Tal, a professor in Tel Aviv University’s Psychology Department, is the author of several notable works on the issue, including Social Psychology of Intergroup Conflict (Springer-Verlag: 1998) and How Children Understand War and Peace (Jossey Bass: 1999). Likewise, Yona Teichman, a clinical psychologist at Tel Aviv University, brings a level of expertise honed from extensive research on the development and application of an implicit, free-response measure of social representations based on the systematic analysis of human figure drawings. Through this dynamic, they strive to contribute to future peace endeavors by prompting the critical analysis of one’s own society and the processes that impede conflict resolution, while encouraging new perspectives that will end the violent cycles that sustain conflict. From a strong opening chapter, the authors negotiate through twelve chapters adeptly, the most notable of which include chapter 4, “Representation of Arabs in Public Discourse”; chapter 5, “Representation of Arabs in School Textbooks”; and chapter 10, “Studies with Schoolchildren, Adolescents, and Young Adults.” All of these chapters are supported by a plethora of tables comprising generali

As the region underwent significant change after World War II, the Holy City increasingly became contested. While the Palestinians nurtured concerns regarding land sales and the escalating influx of Jewish settlers, their apprehension became lost amidst the tussle for authority between Transjordan, which sought to affirm its role as custodian of the holy places, and the nascent state of Israel, which strove to strengthen its presence in the city. Charting the endeavors of KingAbdullah and KingHussein to assert Transjordan’s authority over Jerusalemdespite international and Israeli rivalry, Katz affords a unique insight into the multifarious means used to court its residents through events, banknotes, and stamps between 1948 and 1967. Over the course of seven chapters, the author imbues the text with illuminating figures and maps. Most notable is the 1946 “Palestinian Aid” stamp series initiated during the Bludan Conference in June 1946, during which Abdullah directed member states of the Arab League “to issue a Palestinian stamp whose revenue would be earmarked for Palestine” (p. 56). Yet Abdullah’s pro-active stance – the Jordanian Parliament implemented the Arab League resolution on 22 July 1946, followed by the “Additional Stamps Law” Temporary Law 20 of the same year – was ultimately marred by his series of surreptitious meetings with the JewishAgency. Despite this duplicity, the merit of stamps in preserving stable relations with the Palestinians is

We consider the extent to which the sociology of religion has conflated the necessary elements of narrative structure for the stages of conversion. Taking into consideration more recent research, the paper makes a case for careful and comparative sociological study of conversion narratives-considered as narrative accounts.

After examining the progress of transitional justice in Sri Lanka it is clear that there continues to be significant barriers to the implementation of transitional justice initiatives in Sri Lanka originating substantially from the reluctance of the Sinhala-Buddhist majoritarian state to affect institutional change or acknowledge its role in past abuses.

The prominence of Hamas and the process of Islamization in the West Bank and Gaza are having repercussions on both a local and a regional level, while politics, faith, and nationalism have created a mélange of ideologies.As secularist squares up to Islamist, andHamas and Islamic Jihad vie with the Palestinian Liberation Organization, the objective of the Palestinian struggle becomes trampled in the haste to draw support to either political group. In the midst of this turmoil, Palestinian secular-nationalists are defying their ideological background and turning to religion for support, hope, and survival. The Palestinian political identity is in a state of flux, and Islam’s dominant role in Palestinian society can no longer be ignored or dismissed. The emergence of Loren D. Lybarger’s Identity and Religion in Palestine is, then, a timely publication, as it provides a perceptive analysis of political identities in the Occupied Territories. Through his debut publication, Lybarger draws on interviews and experiences gathered during volunteer work with the Mennonite Central Committee in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. Conducted over a period of six years – three in the 1980s in theWest Bank, two in Gaza in the early 1990s, and one in the West Bank and Gaza from 1999 to 2000 – the author breathes life into accounts of the evolving Palestinian political identity by rendering his respondents’ dilemmas, vulnerabilities, hopes, and fears with startling clarity.

Nadia Taysir Dabbagh approaches the issue with a dexterity honed by medical experience, and her insightful analysis of the two concepts reveals that suicide is perceived as a private act condemned by society and religion, while martyrdom is a public act exalted for the greater good. The fusion of theories plucked from psychiatry, anthropology, and psychology and then coupled with compelling case studies conducted in Ramallah and Gaza creates a coverage that treads the line between objective analysis and morbid fascination, as her research contributes a reasoned account of a startling trend largely lost in a region immersed in its tumultuous past and present and uncertain future. This book is the product of an intercalated M.B.–Ph.D. program submitted to the Psychiatry Department at University College London. The introductory chapter incorporates an elucidated methodology that identifies biological, social, and psychological study approaches, with the primary system of analysis resting on the latter. This person-centred technique perceives suicide as an individual phenomenon linked to risk factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, and stressful life events) and associations. Likewise, the social approach favors a broader angle and associates suicide with such social conditions as unemployment, domestic violence, and sociopolitical protest. The biological approach draws a correlation between affective disorders, such as bipolar disorder, and suicide. Eminent suicidologists, such as Michael Kral, Silvia S. Canetto, and David Lester, who assert that suicidal behavior should be placed in it

As the authors of A Concise History of the Middle East indicate from the outset, the challenge of conveying the relevance of past events to contemporary affairs is both complex yet essential. For Arthur Goldschmidt Jr. and Lawrence Davidson, the course is well-worn, as their publication enters its eighth edition since 1979.With a plethora of maps depicting the transitory regional borders dating from the Byzantine period to the present day, alongside cogent depictions of the Hashemite lineage and the Ottoman sultans and a piquant narrative, Goldschmidt and Davidson provide an account that proves – although directed toward undergraduate students and neophytes to the Middle East – a satisfying meander through regional triumphs and despairs over the course of twenty-one chapters. Consigned as “a dreary bore, a dead subject suited only to cranks, antique-lovers, or perhaps a few students seeking bits of small talk with which to impress their peers” (p. 2), the authors grapple with the waning allure of history in contemporary society in their introduction. Aware of the limitations, the opening chapter strives to rouse the reader with a swift assessment of the Middle East’s global contributions to language, religion, philosophy, mathematics, and science.Avoiding the plaintive plea to comprehend the origins of the current conflicts, the authors combine drollness with facts to ensure that the narrative does not falter and reiterate poignant questions throughout the publication, such as: “AsAmericans, who may at times ...","[0.04143824, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07021218, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01411072]",education,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06

Since 1948, internecine conflict has flared in Israel/Palestine, Lebanon, and Iraq, with neighboring states sustaining the consequences of the tensions.Applying interfaith dialogue (IFD) as ameans to promote peaceful relations is thus, by its very nature, fraught with controversy and uncertainty. Yet this unique approach draws on peace-building mechanisms that bear such religious nuances as reconciliation, mercy, and forgiveness. By eschewing secular concepts for religious resources, IFD provides a point from which individuals can transcend the religious divide in search of further understanding and peace.Accordingly, following the activities of IFD organizations in Israel/Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, and Lebanon is a complex undertaking for the authors of Unity in Diversity. Having previously addressed Nonviolence and Peacebuilding in Islam: Theory and Practice (University Press of Florida: 2003) and Dialogue, Conflict Resolution, and Change: Arab-Jewish Encounters in Israel (State University of New York Press: 1999), Abu-Nimer, an associate professor with the International Peace and Conflict Resolution Program, lends a revealing insight into faith-based resolution.

Finally, the essay evaluates how far the political tensions of the past continue to mark the present through the subsequent generation of religious movements emerging from the revolution.","[0.0536121, 0.00374202, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00025438]",politics,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

In Palestine–Israel, demarcation is enacted through the separation wall, the Green Line and the smart fence along the Gaza Strip. To the established boundaries, informal demarcations are added, running through the land and communities physically, in the case of Firing Zone 918, and ideologically through Othering and transactions in the zones of transition. This article considers Othering and the negotiation of space in the context of (un)official boundaries in the West Bank and deconstructs the intersection of culture, politics and place, as well as the boundary practices enacted by the state, community and the individual. First, the article distinguishes between the types of borders and boundaries in the West Bank, before considering the manner in which Otherness is practiced in the context of movement and the separation wall, as residents negotiate the transition through and around the barrier. From Othering in the transition zone, the study questions how far the experiences of Palestinians and Israelis correlate with the broader border/boundary discourse, the extent to which negative reciprocity is practiced at the checkpoints, and whether subliminal boundaries and (re)naming influences stability in the region.","[0.0420203, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00252719, 0.00201506, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00685701, 0.07008028]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

As social trust is re-evaluated, social spaces have become sites of tension where divisions re-emerge along political, ideological, and economic lines. By focusing on the Libyan diaspora, the article presents an insight into the ways that conflict trauma shapes trust-building, and considers the challenges faced by civil society organisations and government bodies in their efforts to facilitate support and community-building on the island. The article is based on 14 interviews conducted in 2015 with members of the Libyan diaspora, and Maltese civil society organisations and government bodies. The interviewees discussed the multifaceted aspects of trust-building, including the legacy of 42 years of political distrust during the regime of the former Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, regional affiliations and divisions, and the continuum of trauma that unfolds in the Maltese Open Centres and in the host community. The findings of the study indicate that there are additional structural impediments that extend beyond the ongoing conflict, including the Maltese detention process, the redrawing of political boundaries around social spaces in the towns, and the role of identity, which present determining factors in the building of social trust. Collectively, these aspects hold implications for integration into the diaspora community on the island, while in the long term, individual recovery from conflict trauma is dependent on the trust-networks that are constructed, or joined, by the refugees.","[0.07052733, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04851223, 0.00210087]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

He wrote, ‘this country wants nostalgia. They want to go back as far as they can. Even if it’s only as far as last week. Not to face now or tomorrow, but to face backwards’ (ibid.). Reagan ran under the slogan ‘Let’s make America great again’, which was later revived by Donald Trump, albeit truncated into the shorter ‘MAGA’. As we are increasingly seeing, ‘they’ are still waiting for a greater future to be imported from the imagined past, and not only in America.

It is generally accepted that identification with traditional worship declined over the middle of the twentieth century as identification with Islam and Christianity increased, leaving these the two dominant religious groups in the country. The current relative proportions of Christians and Muslims has often been the subject of conjecture, guesswork and assertion, as have trajectories of growth or decline. Purpose Where researchers have used sound data to address this question, they have often drawn on a single survey, or, if on multiple data sources, it is unclear how the different estimates the data provides are reconciled. This paper seeks to address these gaps to construct a better picture of the religious composition of Nigeria, and to consider the trajectory of change. Methods This study presents data from 11 nationally representative surveys of adults conducted between 1990 and 2018. Surveys include four waves of the World Values Survey, five waves of the Afrobarometer survey, The Pew Tolerance and Tension survey, and the Nigerian General Household Survey of 2010. Results The results show that identification with Christianity is likely to have been the majority among Nigerian adults through this period. Evidence suggests that identification with Christianity was still growing in the first half of the 1990s, to a high point of 69% of the adult population. This growth was associated with the tail of the decline of identification with traditional worship. Thereafter identification with Christianity has declined in proportional terms as identification with Isla

It explores observed patterning in winds and rains as a product of more than a single generation’s understanding. New ethnographic fieldwork findings from Isluga, northern Chile, are juxtaposed with information from notes made during previous periods of fieldwork the authors have conducted since the late 1970s and the 1980s. Comparisons with other anthropologists’ findings, seventeenth-century dictionary entries, and meteorological explanations are used to deepen the historical context for how people talk about winds, rain, and weather disruptions. While their observations of rainfall patterns concur with meteorologically collected data in important aspects, their accounts of disruptions to weather patterns provide a vivid portrayal of the winds’ unpredictable power to prevent precipitation from falling during the rainy season. People’s sensorial experiences of the winds emphasize the nonvisual, audible character of the elements, and our research participants personify bitterly cold westerlies as unruly, disruptive cannibal brothers. The text of this report coalesces round the themes of living in an arid land shaped by winds and what happens when the seasons are disrupted in a ceaselessly wind-blown atmosphere.","[0.02137779, 0.00635573, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00051398, 0.0041496, 0.0055016, 0.0, 0.0150394, 0.0, 0.03608032, 0.0]",community_service,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

In the light of Foucauldian and Agambeian biopolitical theory about diminishing of life to bare existence and under the influence of Judith Butler and Guy Standing about vulnerability and precariousness of modern mobile refugee and migrant, I examine three relocation camps in Northern Greece and three squats in the city centre of Thessaloniki as to the opportunities they offer to refugees for political participation and representation, the power dynamics with non-government and civil society organizations and the effect that anti-systemic groups may have on their future political presence. I necessarily engage in a discussion about the role of care regimes in cases of humanitarian crises and I observe the power dynamics among all the various bodies in a camp as well as the relationships of refugees, activists and anarchists in a squat. It is a qualitative research that employs elements from ethnography as well as Glasser and Strauss’ grounded theory. The drawn conclusion affirm a tendency for the refugee to be silenced, often excluded from negotiation table and being treated as a child or victim in bigger relocation camps while in smaller settlements they are largely guided by civil society movements. In contrast, life in a squat, engagement in social activities and interaction with local activists appears to empower refugees significantly more than life in camps in addition to orienting them to claim their rights of political participation and self-management.

SPSS Version 26 was used to perform regression analyses to determine factors influencing financial behaviour, financial stress, and locus of control. The fitness of the financial well-being model indicated an R-square value of 0.386. The model explained 38.6 per cent of the variances in financial well-being.

Financial behaviour and internal locus of control were shown to positively impact financial well-being; whereby financial stress was negatively influencing financial well-being. Financial stress occurs when a person's financial resources are insufficient to meet basic financial needs.

Thus, this study will examine both objective and subjective qualities, or both subjectively or objectively traits, that contribute to the definition of financial well-being in three selected developed, developing, and underdeveloped countries. The authors conduct a systematic review of the literature (SLR) to inform future research on financial well-being. Identifying prior conceptualisations and definitions of financial well-being was the primary goal of this systemic literature review. Next, the second goal was ascertaining factors that influence financial well-being in three distinct nations. These countries were divided into three categories: developed, developing, and underdeveloped countries. A systematic review enables a researcher to identify the most pertinent papers to address the study issue while minimising errors. As a result of the findings, a subjective method is recognised as a more inclusive technique than an objective approach for defining and measuring a complex and personal phenomenon such as financial well-being. This study is intended to stimulate scholars to continue developing knowledge to enable financial institutions to adopt proactive measures to improve financial well-being.","[0.01958347, 0.0, 0.10267359, 0.0, 0.01883778, 0.0, 0.01571715, 0.00937188, 0.04453132, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",covid,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

This is because the older generation had more opportunities to cast partisan votes and developed stronger affiliations to the party for which they voted. However, with the ability to access information and engage online for everyone, this heterogeneous culture has given Malaysian youths a new and tangible existence in the scene of politics. Therefore, the purposes of this study is to explore the issues faced by youths in politics, how can aspiring politicians communicate effectively with youths today and to understand how does political communication work in youth circles. The study interviewed fifteen respondents, which all of them were university students between the ages of 18 and 35. The data collection strategy was an in-depth interview followed by a semi-structured interview protocol. Through the thematic analysis, this study found that there are still barriers surrounding politics, which are age, experience, and general perception between old and new politicians, including education, which seems to be a recurring topic. Furthermore, this research also spotted out that females do not have a significant share of voice in politics. This has concluded that the youth political environment remains an undeveloped area in Malaysia.","[0.05485871, 0.0, 0.0, 0.03038985, 0.0, 0.09043871, 0.01335524, 0.00160352, 0.0, 0.00447399, 0.00688918, 0.0]",education,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 5.25667891e-04

When mandating or forbidding a specific behaviour is not permissible, public health professionals may draw on behaviour change interventions to achieve socially beneficial policy objectives. Interventions can have two main effects: (i) a direct effect on people initially targeted by the intervention; and (ii) an indirect effect mediated by social influence and by the observation of other people's behaviour. However, people's attitudes and beliefs can differ markedly throughout the population, with the result that these two effects can interact to produce unexpected, unhelpful and counterintuitive consequences. Public health professionals need to understand this interaction better. This paper illustrates the key principles of this interaction by examining two important areas of public health policy: tobacco smoking and vaccination. The example of antismoking campaigns shows when and how public health professionals can amplify the effects of a behaviour change intervention by taking advantage of the indirect pathway. The example of vaccination campaigns illustrates how underlying incentive structures, particularly anticoordination incentives, can interfere with the indirect effect of an intervention and stall efforts to scale up its implementation. Recommendations are presented on how public health professionals can maximize the total effect of behaviour change interventions in heterogeneous populations based on these concepts and examples.","[0.00659331, 0.0244031, 0.08784837, 0.0, 0.01873896, 0.0, 0.03456322, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00281114, 0.09413464, 0.00501773]",community_service,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

People within every society have cultural brains—brains that have evolved to selectively seek out adaptive knowledge and socially transmit solutions. Innovations emerge at a population level through the transmission of serendipitous mistakes, incremental improvements and novel recombinations. The rate of innovation through these mechanisms is a function of (1) a society's size and interconnectedness (sociality), which affects the number of models available for learning; (2) fidelity of information transmission, which affects how much information is lost during social learning; and (3) cultural trait diversity, which affects the range of possible solutions available for recombination. In general, and perhaps surprisingly, all three levers can increase and harm innovation by creating challenges around coordination, conformity and communication. Here, we focus on the ‘paradox of diversity’—that cultural trait diversity offers the largest potential for empowering innovation, but also poses difficult challenges at both an organizational and societal level. We introduce ‘cultural evolvability’ as a framework for tackling these challenges, with implications for entrepreneurship, polarization and a nuanced understanding of the effects of diversity. This framework can guide researchers and practitioners in how to reap the benefits of diversity by reducing costs.

Many modern societies and even groups of societies cooperate on large-scale projects with relatively low levels of conflict, but the scale and intensity of cooperation varies dramatically between societies. Here we attempt to formalize dynamics that may be driving this rapid increase in cooperation and the differences we see between societies. Our model extends an N-person stag hunt to include population growth dynamics, ""stags"" with different sized payoffs, and competition for these stags. An increasing number of cooperators is required to access larger stags. The payoff from these stags in turn increases carrying capacity, which increases competition for the stag. As population size increases, new cooperative thresholds are attainable, and as population size shrinks, previously attainable thresholds fall out of reach. Among other predictions, we show that when a new threshold is accessible to a population, the level of cooperation will increase to reach this threshold. However, when the next threshold is out of reach, cooperation decreases as individuals refrain from costly cooperation, preferring a smaller stag. This model offers a framework for understanding the rapid increase in the scale of human cooperation and decline of violence, differences between societies, and challenges to future cooperation.","[0.02906014, 0.00686348, 0.00154106, 0.0, 0.00788412, 0.0, 0.05022866, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00805836, 0.0, 0.00585223]",health_medicine,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01

This dataset contains 172 unique CVR transcripts (with 21,626 lines of transcript: averaging: 106.001 conversational turns; SD = 51.727, range: 1-641), and capturing approximately 15% of historic aviation fatalities in commercial and corporate aviation between 1962 and 2018. CVR transcripts involved airlines registered across 42 countries, with accidents occurring across 50 countries. The dataset was compiled by extracting CVR transcripts from three primary data sources and excluding duplicate and non-English entries. The data contains variables describing the i) raw data, ii) content and characteristics of the CVR transcripts, and iii) behaviours coded by research assistants in support of the associated research article. The data existed of conversational turns amongst flight crew (total = 19,393; within transcripts: m = 112.750; SD = 124.829) and other data (n = 2213; within transcripts: m = 12.866; SD = 14.452; e.g., background sounds, transcriber notes). Conversational turns were uttered by junior (39.00%) and senior (35.44%) flight crew, and others (25.56%).

This device, called discrete mode (DM) laser, is basically a ridge waveguide Fabry-Perot (FP) laser, whose wavelength spectra has been modified to obtain a single mode operation. This is achieved by perturbing the effective refractive index of the guided mode along very small sections of the laser cavity, by etching features into the ridge waveguide. Suitable positioning of these interfaces allows the mirror loss spectrum of an FP laser to be manipulated in order to achieve single longitudinal mode emission. The waveguide structure requires only a single growth stage and uses optical lithography to realise the ridge. In addition, the fabrication process is re-growth free. Despite this simple and low cost fabrication process, the DM lasers portray many advantages over the distributed feedback and distributed Bragg reflector lasers, such as very high side mode suppression ratio, stable operation over a large temperature range, narrow linewidth and low sensitivity to optical feedback.","[0.01012255, 0.00240404, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00144993, 0.0, 0.04215923, 0.00100635, 0.00467508, 0.00191972, 0.0, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

We then investigate the relationship between competitive funding and public communication across levels of excellence.

Thus, the very destiny of any society is now entwined with its ability to develop a genuine science and technology culture, accessible for participation not only to the few who, by virtue of their training or trade, work in the science and technology fields, but to all, thereby creating occasions for society to debate and to foster a positive dialogue about the directions of change and future choices. This book organized on the theme of ‘knowing, sharing, caring: new insights for a diverse world’, which was derived from the observation that globalization rests upon diversity—diversity of contexts, publics, research, strategies and new innovating practices—and aims to stimulate exchanges, discussions and debates, to initiate a reflection conducive to decentring and to be an opportunity for enrichment by providing the reader with means to achieve the potentialities of that diversity through a comparison of the visions that underpin the attitudes of social actors, the challenges they perceive and the potential solutions they consider. Thus, this book aims first and foremost to raise questions in such a manner that readers so stimulated will feel compelled to contribute and will do so. In this spirit, however significant, the results presented and shared are less important than the questions they seek to answer: How are we to rethink the diffusion, the propagation and the sharing of scientific thought and knowledge in an ever more complex and diverse world?

Several theorists have suggested that the attachment system is closely connected to orientations and behaviors in social and political domains, such that the latter are grounded in the same set of familial experiences as are the different attachment styles. We use a large sample of Norwegian twins (N = 1987) to assess the relationship between attachment styles and two key ideological orientations, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO), and the role of genetic and environmental influences therein. We also consider the relationship of both sets of traits with the interpersonal orientations of trust and altruism. Results indicate no shared environmental overlap between attachment and ideology, nor even between the two attachment styles or between the two ideological traits, challenging conventional wisdom in developmental, social, and political psychology. Rather, evidence supports two functionally distinct systems, one for navigating intimate relationships and one for navigating social hierarchies, with genetic overlap between traits within each system, and two distinct genetic linkages to trust and altruism.

Space agencies such as NASA and ESA have ambitious long-term programmes of science and discovery that mark the beginning of a new era in space exploration where humans will be sent to Mars; An era that requires public support and, therefore, more consideration for public opinion. This study shows that the British public who come to outreach and engagement activities consider the advancement of UK space activities nationally to be of interest. In 2008, over 700 Britons were surveyed at two space outreach events in the UK, the Royal Society Summer Exhibition in London and the National Space Centre in Leicester, to determine their attitudes to space exploration. When asked about means to explore space, the majority agreed that space should be explored both by mankind and machines, scoring ""generating new scientific knowledge and advance human culture"" as the most important reason for keeping exploring space. Although the greater number of supporters said that more money should be allocated to civil space activities, there were some concerns about risk and value. This paper will investigate the views and attitudes towards space exploration of this segment of the population and how it may relate to support for space exploration.","[0.04667902, 0.00271405, 0.00497694, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00387636, 0.01706545, 0.00427357, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01205774, 0.03219376]",politics,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01

Its presence improves innovation and error prevention. This evidence synthesis had 3 objectives: explore the current literature regarding psychological safety, identify methods used in its assessment and investigate for evidence of consequences of a psychologically safe environment. Methods We searched multiple trial registries through December 2018. All studies addressing psychological safety within healthcare workers were included and reviewed for methodological limitations. A thematic analysis approach explored the presence of psychological safety. Content analysis was utilised to evaluate potential consequences. Results We included 62 papers from 19 countries. The thematic analysis demonstrated high and low levels of psychological safety both at the individual level in study participants and across the studies themselves. There was heterogeneity in responses across all studies, limiting generalisable conclusions about the overall presence of psychological safety. A wide range of methods were used. Twenty-five used qualitative methodology, predominantly semi-structured interviews. Thirty quantitative or mixed method studies used surveys. Ten studies inferred that low psychological safety negatively impacted patient safety. Nine demonstrated a significant relationship between psychological safety and team outcomes.

Studies therefore aim to prevent accidental harm through interventions for reducing safety silence. Yet, the behaviour remains poorly understood, obstructing effective safety management: it is unclear to what extent safety silence involves muted safety voice (the partial withholding of safety concerns), and how muted safety voice can be recognised in speech, may be measured based on the degrees and types of safety voice (speaking up about safety), progresses over time, and may be optimally reduced. To improve safety management, this study proposes a conceptual model for the manifestation of safety silence and muted safety voice using a laboratory experiment (N = 404) to evaluate the implications for the effectiveness of three interventions (salient hazards, clear responsibilities, encouragements) across stages of a hazard. Results indicated that safety silence and muted safety voice are measurable in terms of the degree to which concerned people engage in five types of safety voice at different points in time, and we revealed this is important for safety management: interventions only unmute safety voice at unique hazard stages and for knowledge-based speech when people are concerned. This indicates that safety silence and muted safety voice are situated and can be recognised in nuanced speech, with interventions being most effective when timed appropriately and people have safety concerns to speak up about.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00191377, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04358395, 0.0, 0.05591437, 0.04320402, 0.02484743, 0.0]",economy,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

Clinicians’ endorsement and uptake of these tests is crucial to maximise engagement; however, adoption may be impeded if users harbour unaddressed concerns or if device usage is incompatible with local practice. Accordingly, we strove to identify ICU clinicians’ beliefs about molecular diagnostic tests for pneumonias before implementation at the point-of-care. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with 35 critical care doctors working in four ICUs in the United Kingdom. A clinical vignette depicting a fictitious patient with signs of pneumonia was used to explore clinicians’ beliefs about the importance of molecular diagnostics and their concerns. Data were analysed thematically. Results Clinicians’ beliefs about molecular tests could be grouped into two categories: perceived potential of molecular diagnostics to improve antibiotic prescribing (Molecular Diagnostic Necessity) and concerns about how the test results could be implemented into practice (Molecular Diagnostic Concerns). Molecular Diagnostic Necessity stemmed from beliefs that positive results would facilitate targeted antimicrobial therapy; that negative results would signal the absence of a pathogen, and consequently that having the molecular diagnostic results would bolster clinicians’ prescribing confidence. Molecular Diagnostic Concerns included unfamiliarity with the device’s capabilities, worry that it would detect non-pathogenic bacteria, uncertainty whether it would fail to detect pathogens, and discomfort with withholding antibiotics until receiving mo

In a longitudinal ethnographic case study I investigated in real-time over a period of three years an incumbent organisation’s efforts to organise for disruptive innovation from an organisation-creation perspective. Using a processual, practice-based, engaged scholarship approach, I followed the situated development of six potentially disruptive innovation projects on-the-ground as they unfolded at Thales UK, a leading multinational technology company. As a full member of Thales UK Research, Technology and Innovation (RTI), I observed and contributed directly to the company’s efforts to organise for disruptive innovation from an insider account. I show how the company’s efforts to organise for disruptive innovation interrupted organisational members’ collectively held practical understandings of their work, illuminate how the established organisational arrangement is used in everyday performative efforts to organise for disruptive innovation, and illustrate how the entrepreneurial development of disruptive opportunities over time is both shaped by and impacts on the organisational context they develop within.

This paper examines the potential of combining insights from patient complaints and staff incident reports for a more comprehensive understanding of the causes and severity of harm. Methods Using five years of patient complaints and staff incident reporting data at a large multi-site hospital in London (in the United Kingdom), this study conducted retrospective patient-level data linkage to identify overlapping reports. Using a combination of quantitative coding and in-depth qualitative analysis, we then compared level of harm reported, identified descriptions of adjacent events missed by the other party and examined combined narratives of mutually identified events. Results Incidents where complaints and incident reports overlapped (n = 446, reported in 7.6%’ of all complaints and 0.6% of all incident reports) represented a small but critical area of investigation, with significantly higher rates of Serious Incidents and severe harm. Linked complaints described greater harm from safety incidents in 60% of cases, reported many surrounding safety events missed by staff (n = 582), and provided contesting stories of why problems occurred in 46% cases, and complementary accounts in 26% cases. Conclusions This study demonstrates the value of using patient complaints to supplement, test, and challenge staff reports, including to provide greater insight on the many potential factors that may give rise to unsafe care.

Research indicates power distance and poor listening to safety concerns (safety listening) suppresses safety voice. Yet, despite fruitful hypotheses and training programs, data is based on imagined and simulated scenarios and it remains unclear to what extent speaking-up poses a genuine problem for safety management, how negative responses shape the behaviour, or how this can be explained by power distance. Moreover, this means it remains unclear how the concept of safety voice is relevant for understanding accidents. To address this, 172 Cockpit Voice Recorder transcripts of historic aviation accidents were identified, integrated into a novel dataset (n = 14,128 conversational turns), coded in terms of safety voice and safety listening and triangulated with Hofstede’s power distance. Results revealed that flight crew spoke-up in all but two accidents, provided the first direct evidence that power distance and safety listening explain variation in safety voice during accidents, and indicated partial effectiveness of CRM training programs because safety voice and safety listening changed over the course of history, but only for low power distance environments. Thus, findings imply that accidents cannot be assumed to emerge from a lack of safety voice, or that the behaviour is sufficient for avoiding harm, and indicate a need for improving interventions across environments.

We explored how beliefs, perceptions and contextual factors influenced ICU clinicians’ antibiotic prescribing. Methods We conducted 4 focus groups and 34 semistructured interviews with clinicians involved in antibiotic prescribing in four English ICUs. Focus groups explored factors influencing prescribing, whereas interviews examined decision-making processes using two clinical vignettes. Data were analysed using thematic analysis, applying the Necessity Concerns Framework. Results Clinicians’ antibiotic decisions were influenced by their judgement of the necessity for prescribing/not prescribing, relative to their concerns about potential adverse consequences. Antibiotic necessity perceptions were strongly influenced by beliefs that antibiotics would protect patients from deterioration and themselves from the ethical and legal consequences of undertreatment. Clinicians also reported concerns about prescribing antibiotics. These generally centred on antimicrobial resistance; however, protecting the individual patient was prioritised over these societal concerns. Few participants identified antibiotic toxicity concerns as a key influencer. Clinical uncertainty often complicated balancing antibiotic necessity against concerns. Decisions to start or continue antibiotics often represented ‘erring on the side of caution’ as a protective response in uncertainty. This approach was reinforced by previous experiences of negative consequences (‘being burnt’) which motivated prescribing ‘just in case’ of an infection. Prescribing decisions were also

By capturing and analysing the content of speech when people raise (safety voice) or withhold safety concerns (safety silence), communication patterns may be identified for when individuals perceive risk, and safety management may be improved through identifying potential antecedents. This dataset contains transcribed speech from 404 participants (nstudents = 377; nfemale = 277, Age M(sd) = 22.897(5.386)) engaged in a simulated hazardous scenario (walking across an unsafe plank), capturing 18,078 English words (M(sd) = 46.117(37.559)). The data was collected through the Walking the plank paradigm (Noort et al, 2019), which provides a validated laboratory experiment designed for the direct observation of communication in response to hazardous scenarios that elicit safety concerns. Three manipulations were included in the design: hazard salience (salient vs not salient), responsibilities (clear vs diffuse) and encouragements (encouraged vs discouraged). Speech between two set timepoints in the hazardous scenario was transcribed based on video recordings and coded in terms of the extent to which speech involved safety voice or safety silence.

This activity, the end of the Cold War and the increasing impacts of neo-liberal globalisation combined to spark hopes for greatly expanding practices of labour transnationalism. This vision of transnationalising trade union organisation has not materialised and, in fact, inside Canadian unions there has been declining faith in the possibilities of building transnational solidarity. Starting with an analysis of the dominant dichotomies underlying the literature on labour transnationalism, I suggest that stepping outside these dichotomies can provide a different way of assessing the role of transnational labour solidarity within broader struggles for workers’ justice. In this article, drawing upon the case of transnational political solidarities built by workers inside Canadian unions in the 1980s and 1990s, I argue that assessing transnational practices with a longer view to class formation and the goals of workers’ emancipation can help to expand conceptions of what constitutes successful transnational practice. Such a reassessment of the role of labour transnationalism is particularly timely in the current context of right-wing populism.","[0.04622593, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01938412, 0.02322831, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02848483, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07338843]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Their contestations of marriage impact the norms within rebel groups as well as the development of new crimes against humanity in international criminal law.

In the introduction to this special issue, we briefly chart the intellectual genealogy of political ecology, identify vital challenges faced today, and present a new set of studies that respond to these concerns. We conceptualize power as a social relation built on the asymmetrical distribution of resources and risks and locate power in the interactions among, and the processes that constitute, people, places, and resources. Politics, then, are found in the practices and mechanisms through which such power is circulated. The focus here is on politics related to the environment, understood as biophysical phenomena, together with human knowledge and practice. To apply these concepts, we promote multiscale research models that articulate selected ecological phenomena and local social processes, together with regional and global forces and ideas.

These samples were assessed for population genetic parameters that impact forensic statistical calculations. All population samples were highly polymorphic for the 16 Y STR markers with the marker DYS385 being the most polymorphic, because it is comprised of two loci. Most (2677 out of a total of 2806 distinct haplotypes) of the 16 marker haplotypes observed in the sample populations were represented only once in the data set. Haplotype diversities were greater than 99.57% for the Chinese, Malay, Thai, Japanese, and Indian sample populations. For the Y STR markers, population substructure correction was considered when calculating the rarity of a Y STR profile. An F(ST) value, rather than a R(ST) value, is more appropriate under a forensic model. Because the F(ST) values are very small within the Asian populations, the estimate of the rarity of a haplotype comprised of 10-16 markers does not need substructure correction. However haplotypes with fewer markers may require F(ST) corrections when calculating the rarity of the profile.","[0.0005668, 0.0011426, 0.00240534, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04794072, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Despite improvements in the subnational disclosure of royalty payments, a significant problem is the failure of these efforts to improve accountability and benefits to mining communities. Purpose The article asks how institutions of local governance affect national efforts to improve accountability to mining communities in Ghana on the use of mineral revenues for development. It contributes to the broader theoretical literature on EITI by clarifying what outcomes, if any, can be directly attributed to the disclosure of royalty payments. Methods and approach This qualitative study employs a case-study analysis of EITI adoption in Ghana, one of the first countries to join the initiative. The article contextualizes local governance institutions and dynamics in relation to the royalty disbursement process. It draws on original field research to analyse their role in impeding the expected benefits of royalty disbursements to mining-affected communities. Findings The research identifies deficiencies in local governance structures and processes as they relate to the use of mineral royalties, but also instances of variation in how officials react to EITI. The range of individual actors, institutions and complex processes on which the subnational disbursement of royalties depends, makes it problematic to attribute the absence of improvements directly to Ghana’s EITI. The findings demonstrate that EITI’s role in participating countries is best understood as facilitative and indirect when addressing development outcomes for mining commu

Roosvall and Tegelberg (Chapter 22) detail how attention to economic, cultural, and political justice must be combined with attention to geographical scope, suggesting that future research consider how geographical scales are combined or disconnected in climate change reporting for diverse types of media. In Chapter 23, Yagodin applies a pluralistic climate justice approach, which includes justice for nature, and zooms in on Russian climate change reporting.

Central to the SIB model is the question of evaluation and the method to be used in determining program outcomes and investor returns. In the United States, the randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been the dominant method. However, this has not been without controversy. Some SIB practitioners and investors have argued that, while this may be the perfect tool, the need to grow the SIB market demands a more pragmatic approach. Drawing from a three-year study of SIBs, and informed by Science and Technology Studies (STS)-inspired work on valuation and the social life of methods, the article explores RCTs as both a valuation technology central to SIB design and the object of a micropolitics of valuation which has impeded market growth. It is the relationship between, and the politics of, evaluation and valuation that is a key lesson of the SIB experiment and an important insight for future research on “social investment” and other settings where methods are constitutive of financial value.","[0.0226807, 0.0, 0.00629232, 0.00207371, 0.04334537, 0.02166478, 0.0237667, 0.01123765, 0.0, 0.02708284, 0.01169773, 0.00695693]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 7.64747297e-06

However, empirical analysis of the reintegration outcomes for survivors remains limited in the African context. Hence, this paper aims to examine the challenges and opportunities of reintegration assistance programs for survivors of human trafficking in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on qualitative methods of data collection and analysis, this study conducted semi-structured interviews with repatriated women who have accessed reintegration assistance in Nigeria, and data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings The findings suggest that while the reintegration programs might address the procedural aspect of reintegration, the achievement of substantive reintegration remains incomplete. This is because of the structural conditions of the context within which reintegration is supposed to occur. Practical implications There is a need to take seriously the distinction between the reintegration of survivors into a new community or a former community in the design of a regime of care for survivors of human trafficking in Africa. Crucially, the focus on procedural reintegration should not also divert attention away from the structural conditions and reforms needed to ensure survivors achieve substantive reintegration. Originality/value This paper contributes to the limited literature on life after trafficking and demonstrates the strengths and limitations of reintegration programs as a regime of care for survivors of human trafficking.

The paper adopts a strategic-relational approach that recognises the variability in state capacities over time and space. Empirically, it draws upon secondary sources and interviews with stakeholder groups. Our findings reveal the complex nature of CSR and the dynamic, yet resilient, role of state actors in a context of strong state–business interdependence, institutional incompatibility, and fragmented powers across diverse state branches.

However well-intentioned these interventions might be, they nonetheless remain subject to a host of limitations and complications. Recent efforts to combat contemporary slavery are too often sensationalist, self-serving, and superficial and, therefore, end up failing the crucial test of speaking truth to power. The widely held notion that antislavery is one of those rare issues that ""transcends"" politics or ideology is only sustainable because the underlying issues at stake have been constructed and demarcated in a way that minimizes direct challenges to dominant political and economic interests. This must change. By providing an original approach to the underlying issues at stake, Contemporary Slavery will help readers understand the political practices that have been concealed beneath the popular rhetoric and establishes new conversations between scholars of slavery and trafficking and scholars of human rights and social movements.","[0.09832782, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",politics,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

This gave rise to “symbolic efforts … to preserve a sense of meaning and coherence in the face of social changes that they found threatening and confusing. Residents sought to “recall and reaffirm an untainted world that existed nowhere but in their imaginations. These conclusions are fascinating and prescient, and have led many of us since then to probe legal perceptions in the face of growing normative pluralism. Much like the study of residents of Sander County in Engel’s “Oven Bird’s Song, Carole Greenhouse writes about perceptions of disputes and litigation in a small town she calls Hopewell in Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town (1986). In Greenhouse’s preface, she discusses her own assumptions going into her study. She writes: I went to Hopewell in September 1973 to study dispute settlement in an American community, and my assumption, or hope, was that the role of the court in the social fabric of a town would be thrown into relief if the community was in the process of change. The rest of the book should make it clear why such a legal study was not possible in this community and also how it is that one can begin a study of an American community by looking for conflict and end by considering a person’s relationship to God.

Recently a number of humanitarian and activist organizations, including Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Sea-Watch, and WatchTheMed, have organized to aid migrants in distress at sea using surveillance technologies, ranging from drones to GPS. By doing so, they presented a challenge to the European border surveillance regime. In dialogue with the concept of countersurveillance, this paper introduces the concepts of humanitarian surveillance and human rights surveillance and deploys them to examine and categorize the activities of MOAS, MSF, Sea-Watch, and WatchTheMed. Humanitarian surveillance narrowly focuses on aiding victims of surveillance without problematizing the logic and hierarchies of surveillance, while human rights surveillance operates as a form of countersurveillance; it aims to protect and advance the human rights of victims of surveillance and expose human rights violations committed by authorities through opposing the hierarchies of surveillance. The paper shows how civilian groups incorporate elements of humanitarian and human rights surveillance in their activities at varying levels and discusses the extent to which they challenge the European border surveillance regime.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.47066114]",politics,"[9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01

It identifies three elements that played determinant roles in the articulation of the event: the politics of equality enacted by migrants, the ethics of hospitality and witnessing enacted by the Greek activists and host populations and the sacredness of the event. Critically engaging with the theories of Rancière, Derrida, Agamben and Durkheim, this paper demonstrates how these elements encountered and how their encounter helped migrants to achieve rights, albeit limited and temporary. Moving beyond the particularity of the event, this paper also highlights the event’s importance for migrant politics in times of austerity, and increased surveillance and racism against migrants. Despite its limited and temporary success, the event demonstrates how a politics of equality, ethical openness and respect for human life can form the basis of true cosmopolitan universality.

Alt- hough borders have always been the spaces where individuals are sorted from each other, the database technologies extend this process of sorting to every- where within the EU. The developments in the database and biometrics technology have made it possible to identify people automatically and to reach their records even long after they have entered the EU. Digitization and diffusion of the borders will affect the already disadvantaged segments of the population, such as undocumented migrants, asylum seekers and ordinary travellers, in a negative way. These categories are now put under continual surveillance as if they are potential criminals or terrorists. Yet, the diffusion of the borders with digital technologies should not mean that the localized controls at the external borders have lost their significance. In fact, with the EUROSUR, now the territorial controls have also intensified. The EUROSUR will survey the external EU borders with sophisticated surveillance systems, including manned and un- manned aerial vehicles and satellites, in order prevent irregular migrants from reaching the EU. This paper is divided into three main sections. In the discussion that follows, the paper draws on the surveillance and border studies literature to develop a con- ceptual framework for understanding the digital borders. Second, the paper ex- amines the new EU surveillance mechanisms in detail and their effects on dif- ferent groups. The final section concludes by summarizing the arguments of the paper and discussing the consequences of digital sorting on European citizenship.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00867149, 0.0, 0.00099139, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.44833827]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

The paper also discusses the biopolitical consequences of these practices for migrants such as physical illnesses and injuries, and psychological disorders. The paper contributes to the scholarship on biopolitical borders in two main ways. First, through conceptualising hotspot as a form of biopolitical borderzone and demonstrating the specific biopolitical practices in the Lesvos hotspot and their effects on migrants. Second, through highlighting the key role of waiting in the operations of the biopolitical border.

This paper presents a systematic review of 79 scholarly papers on the topic of solar home system adoption, energy consumption, and social practices in South Asia. Using an intersectionality lens, the paper demonstrates that various categories of difference, such as gender, age, class, and ethnicity, intersect and shape the adoption of this technology in South Asia. Utilizing a social practice theory lens, the paper shows that solar home systems shape the spatial and temporal arrangements and practices of members of households that have adopted the technology, as well as their counterparts who have not. This technology has a practical but also symbolic function; the symbolic function and social meaning are derived from the economic and socio-cultural contexts.

Both campaigns are examples of grassroots international labor solidarity, where organizers sought to build international solidarity through member mobilization and a focus on the power of workers to engage in solidarity actions. I examine how these union activists organized within their unions, and how their organizational differences and the ideological and political contexts they organized within shaped their successes and limitations.

Research-led, the book is informed by two state of the art empirical studies – ‘Face 2 Face’ and ‘Curating Childhoods’ – and links to a dynamic multimedia archive generated by the studies.","[0.04398155, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02589816, 0.0, 0.10536737, 0.0, 0.00197069, 0.01515292, 0.0051795]",child_family,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

Ethical concerns emerge when innovation seems to be propelled by a drive for efficiency and over-reliance on process output indicators, as well as, or even instead of, improving the lives of children, families and societies. No ethical framework exists at present to act as a check on such drivers. This paper reviews the literature with the aim of considering how best to address this gap. Design/methodology/approach This paper draws on a review of innovation in children’s social care, conducted as part of an Economic and Social Research Council-funded project exploring innovation in services for young people exposed to extra-familial risk and harm. Findings This study proposes a new conception of “trustworthy innovation” for the sector that holds innovation in children’s social care to the standards and principles of the code of ethics for social work. This study offers an ethical framework, informed by the interdisciplinary school of organisational ethics, to operationalise this extended definition; the analytic framework guides policymakers and the practice sector to question at every stage of the innovation process whether a particular model is ethically appropriate, as well as practically feasible within a specific context. Implications for local decision-making and national policy are set out, alongside questions raised for future research.

The discussion also explores how methodologies can adapt to an evaluation in these circumstances.

Issues entailed are discussed and illustrated through two case studies of evaluations conducted by the research team within the context of children’s social care in England.

Examples are provided of how the two case studies experienced and addressed these challenges. Research limitations/implications • Quasi-experimental methods can be beneficial tools for understanding the impact of innovation in children’s services, but researchers should also consider the complexity of children’s social care and the use of mixed and appropriate methods. • Those funding innovative practice should consider the additional burden on those working with data and the related data infrastructure if wishing to document and analyse innovation in a robust way. • Data,

In addition to ICT-based formal services (e.g. e-counselling), social workers used ICTs informally as an adjunct to face-to-face practice. Building on our previous research, our cross-sectional online survey examined social workers’ informal use of ICTs in four countries: Canada, the USA, Israel and the UK. The survey was administered through Qualtrics software among social workers across Canada (n = 2,609), the USA (n = 1,225), Israel (n = 386) and the UK (n = 134), and analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 26. The findings substantiate the ubiquitous use of informal ICTs in social work practice, as an adjunct to face-to-face treatment, across the four countries. Given the current, unprecedented context of COVID-19, we discuss the meaning of our findings related to access, ethical considerations (e.g. professional boundaries) and supervision in the context of restricted face-to-face practice. We discuss the implications for social work practice, education and research, and conclude that in the COVID-19 context, there is an even greater need for research, clinical discussion, supervision and policy on informal ICT use in social work practice.","[0.0143459917, 2.56646437e-05, 0.076629921, 0.000570762256, 0.0, 0.0421544471, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0129882069, 0.0, 0.0675180698, 0.0170447888]",covid,"[1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

It has also led to private land owners and developers employing the services of land guards as means of securing and protecting their lands. These land guards, who are often armed, attack rival groups thereby endangering the lives of residents. This study is about how rival chieftaincy groups, in their quest to own and control land, use land guards to lay claims to land. We collected data through interviews, focus group discussion and media reports. The content analysis method was used to examine data for the complexities involved in how the contest for chieftaincy and the control over land fuel the activities of land guards and therefore creates insecurity in the Awutu Traditional Area. The study involved police officers, claimants to the Awutu stool, elders of the area, land guards and community residents. The study found that the activities of land guards in the Awutu Traditional Area have intensified following rival claims to chieftaincy in some parts of the Awutu Traditional Area. Various claimants to stools are using the services of land guards as a way of controlling land because one’s ascendancy to the stool is a guarantee to controlling land. Also, increase in value of land for commercial and residential purposes in the area has intensified claims to the stool. We further found that the engagement of the services of land guards by rival claimants to the stool has escalated violence and resulted in the acquisition of sophisticated arms by various land guards to fight and defend their grasp over the land.

The late Executive Secretary worked tirelessly not only to pre-empt and manage conflicts, but also drew attention of policy makers to the underlying causes of conflict. Consequently, in all the peacebuilding efforts that the NPC engaged in during his tenure, the fundamental issues of poverty, inequality and justice were driving concerns. The chapters in this book were written mainly by academics with several years and decades of research and practice in the fields of Peace Studies, Conflict Management and Development Studies. The authors draw attention to local, regional and national attempts at managing conflicts and peacebuilding and underline the essential roles of justice and stakeholder participation as ingredients to achieve sustainable peace. This is particularly necessary in poor countries/societies where development policies are often skewed in favour of the elite.

In peacebuilding, women are often considered victims and passive targets for aid, rather than contributors to the process. Many studies and peacebuilders have neglected the critical role played by women in the informal sector in peacebuilding, especially at the local level. This study examines how local women help build everyday peace in their community through informal means. Twenty women and four men were purposively selected and interviewed. The results show that women in the informal sector draw on bonding and bridging social capital to improve peacebuilding processes in their community. Although the women studied were not well organised and did not have much formal education, they were able to contribute to peace in their community by creating and using informal social networks/bonds. We argue that women’s societal positions are aspects of social capital that make women agents of “everyday peace” who mobilise to aid informal peacebuilding efforts in the community.

This paper raises questions concerning the place of the archive in different disciplinary traditions; the roles of researcher and archivist in safekeeping, gatekeeping and caring for data collections; and the place of qualitative longitudinal research as a site of innovation within a new data landscape.","[0.02914581, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00053245, 0.0, 0.0142377, 0.0, 0.07845785, 0.0, 0.0, 0.03104609, 0.0]",child_family,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Despite this, studies on the impact of SHGs on women’s asset accumulation and incomes tend to focus on rural and urban areas, with peri-urban areas receiving little attention. Consequently, to help fill this gap, using the after-only study design, this study investigates the contribution of SHGs to asset accumulation in Wa’s peri-urban areas. A questionnaire and an observation guide were used to collect data from 199 SHG members. Thematic analysis was used to analyze qualitative data, while descriptive statistics, parametric and non-parametric methods were used to analyze quantitative data. Members were given loans, according to the study, but the repayment schedule was unfavourable. After joining SHGs, both productive and non-productive assets were acquired. Furthermore, those who took out loans and invested in income-generating ventures saw an increase in their earnings. In general, SHGs contributed to asset acquisition and income. SHG members should invest in productive assets to increase their incomes, according to the policy recommendation of this study. This study is unique because it focuses on SHGs in peri-urban areas, deviating from the norm by arguing that SHGs contribute to asset accumulation in those areas, thereby empowering members.","[0.00670593, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05035129, 0.00620229, 0.0008901, 0.02237719, 0.01098311, 0.04564346, 0.0, 0.0188833, 0.0]",women,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 3.71015619e-06 9.99999000e-01

The adoption regionalisation programme is underpinned by a policy commitment to speed up ‘matching’ processes. The Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 states that adoptions should ‘proceed swiftly’ and some agencies are pioneering online and virtual introductions between children and prospective adopters. This paper offers a timely contribution to practice debates and scholarship in this area. Drawing on a collaborative doctoral study, ‘everyday’ practices are considered through an emergent theoretical framework, the ‘liminal hotspot’. The analysis hones in on the transformative practices generated in the early matching stages and the role of the social worker in their mediation and management. This paper supports findings from other studies that suggest that when matches are rushed necessary processing of complex dynamics is by-passed,creating unnecessary vulnerabilities in the fabric of new families.","[0.05192112, 0.00235552, 0.00073136, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.09404556, 0.00415014, 0.0, 0.02025703, 0.00668837]",child_family,"[9.9999900e-01 9.9999900e-01 7.3454007e-06 3.4822210e-04 1.0000000e-06

We particularly note their willingness to push the boundaries of theoretical developments in Childhood Studies in their themed section on The Future of Childhood Studies and Children & Society (Stryker et al., 2019). They have left us with big boots to fill. Our arrival on the journal comes during highly challenging times globally, with the Covid-19 pandemic , the climate crisis and widening socioeconomic inequalities. A global reckoning with sexual misconduct and racial injustice as witnessed in the #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter movements has both challenged and inspired research and activism in raising awareness of the pernicious effects of inequalities. This raises important questions about the relationship between significant events in society and children's lives: what do these movements teach us about childhood and what does the study of childhood teach us about these movements? Now, more than ever, there is a pressing need to ensure that the voices and lives of children are well represented across research, policy and practice.

Through a study of how UYFs and practitioners in England experienced and constructed each other during their everyday practice encounters, we discuss the potential of the practice space for creating mutual understandings and enabling positive changes. Analysis revealed that their subjective and affective experience of their encounters and of each other, both as individual humans and as representations of particular categories (asylum-seeker/looked-after child and professional helper/agent of the state), influenced how they engaged, communicated, co-constructed understandings of each other and viewed the process and outcomes of the social work contact.

Overcoming the virus is partly dependent on the holistic wellbeing of frontline health workers. Implications of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa could be substantial given the limited resources and logistics. This scoping review maps available literature on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa. Materials and methods Literature on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa were searched in six databases namely Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Africa Journals Online (AJOL) and CINAHL. Further search was done across websites of the ministries of health of West African countries and notable organisations. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the findings taking cognisance of the overarching purpose of the study and the research question. Results Of the 67 studies identified, 19 were included in the final synthesis. Three main themes emerged and these are impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers, drivers of susceptibility to COVID-19 and government/donor support. A greater number of the studies originated from Nigeria. Each study reported at least one impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa. The impacts included death, fear, unwillingness to attend to COVID-19 patients and stigmatisation. Some health workers were not adhering to the safety protocols coupled with periodic shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and thereby had an increased susceptibility.

This presents challenges for health and care systems, which must adapt to meet the needs of this population. This study drew on existing data to understand what matters to people living with multiple long-term conditions and identify priorities for future research. Methods Two studies were conducted. (1) A secondary thematic analysis of interview, survey and workshop data collected from the 2017 James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership for Older People with Multiple Conditions, and patient and public involvement workshops; (2) a review of ongoing research and published research priorities, relating to older people (80+) living with multiple long-term conditions. Findings Older people with multiple long-term conditions identified a number of key concerns: access to care, support for both the patient and their carer, physical and mental health and well-being and identifying opportunities for early prevention. The review identified no published research priorities or ongoing research focusing specifically on populations aged over 80 years with multiple long-term conditions. Conclusion Older people living with multiple long-term conditions experience care that is inadequate for their needs. A holistic approach to care that extends beyond treating single conditions will ensure wide-ranging needs are met. As multimorbidity rises worldwide, this is a critical message for practitioners across health and care settings. We also recommend key areas that should be given greater focus in future research and policy to inform effective and meaningful forms of support for people living with multiple long-term conditions.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.03210172, 0.0, 0.00293291, 0.0, 0.0369209, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.22646595, 0.0]",community_service,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06

Small social networks are associated with poor quality of life. Preliminary evidence suggests that coaching patients to increase their social contacts may be effective. In this study, we assessed whether structured social coaching improves the quality of life of patients with psychosis (primary outcome) compared with an active control group, receiving information on local social activities. Methods and analysis A structured social coaching intervention was developed based on the literature and refined through stakeholder involvement. It draws on principles from motivational interviewing, solution focused therapy and structured information giving. It is provided over a 6-month period and can be delivered by a range of different mental health professionals. Its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness are assessed in a randomised controlled trial, compared with an active control group, in which participants are given an information booklet on local social activities. Participants are aged 18 or over, have a primary diagnosis of a psychotic disorder (International Classification of Disease: F20–29) and capacity to provide informed consent. Participants are assessed at baseline and at 6, 12 and 18 months after individual randomisation. The primary outcome is quality of life at 6 months (Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life). We hypothesise that the effects on quality of life are mediated by an increase in social contacts. Secondary outcomes are symptoms, social situation and time spent in social activities.

In general populations, people living in areas with higher population density have more social contacts, while those living in more socially deprived and fragmented areas are less satisfied with their relationships. We assessed whether and how neighbourhood factors are associated with social contacts and satisfaction with friendships for people with psychosis. Methods We carried out a cross-sectional study including people with psychosis aged 18–65 years in urban and rural sites in England. Population density and social deprivation and fragmentation indexes were described within Lower Level Super Output Areas (LSOA). Their associations with participants’ social contacts and satisfaction with friendships were tested with negative binomial and ordinal regression models, respectively. Results We surveyed 511 participants with psychotic disorders. They had a median of two social contacts in the previous week (interquartile range [IQR] = 1–4), and rated satisfaction with friendships as 5 out of 7 (Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life; IQR = 4–6). Higher population density was associated with fewer social contacts (Z-standardised relative risk [RR] = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.79–0.99, p = 0.03), but not with satisfaction with friendships (RR = 1.08; 95% CI = 0.93–1.26, p = 0.31). No associations were found for social contacts or satisfaction with friendships with social deprivation or fragmentation indexes. Conclusions Clinicians in urban areas should be aware that their patients with psychosis are more socially isolated when more people live around them, and this could impact their clinical outcomes.

In this paper we draw on secondary qualitative data on energy poverty from the UK, as well as conceptual thinking informed by the capabilities approach, to explore a previously understudied facet of energy poverty: households’ social relations. We focus particularly on how relationships with family, friends, agencies and distant others impact on households’ ability to cope with energy poverty. We find that the connection between social relations and energy poverty is recursive: good social relations can both enable access to energy services, and be a product of such access. This connection is also mediated by more structural factors, such as access to resources, membership of particular collectivities, the need to perform particular social roles, and the common reasons attributed to poverty and energy use. Our work suggests that attempts to address vulnerability to energy poverty need to take into account the quality of households’ social relations, as well as the potential impact of policy and practice on social relations, given that people rely on their friends and families for information support and advice, on key agency workers for access to resources, and are also constrained by discourses of poverty.","[0.03509557, 0.00384769, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00508352, 0.01385668, 0.0, 0.03591383, 0.06906539, 0.0, 0.03776411, 0.0]",economy,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

However, to date, while among adults a correlation between income and subjective well-being has been found, findings of such an association during childhood are mixed. This may be because the indicators available for both child poverty and subjective well-being have been limited – mainly to household incomes reported by adults and single measures of life satisfaction. This article explores the opportunities presented by the data collected in the third wave of Children’s Worlds, the school-based survey of children in 35 countries. The study employed a wider range of measures of material well-being, as well as subjective well-being, in terms of living standards in a larger range of countries. We have found that at both country comparative level, and within the country level, there is an association between material deprivation and some measures of subjective well-being, but the strength of the association varied between the country level and individual-level analyses, and across countries at the individual-level. At the macro-country level, the Family Affluence Scale was not significantly associated with most subjective well-being measures, while the deprivation scale, and a multi-dimensional measure that was developed in this paper, showed high correlations with overall life satisfaction and feelings of sadness. At the individual-level, the correlations were generally weak and varied between countries. We conclude with a discussion regarding possible explanations for these findings and their possible implications.","[0.00594221, 0.0, 0.07983919, 0.00588491, 0.0, 0.01023862, 0.07736879, 0.12179971, 0.04646008, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00368752]",child_family,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06

Why do some democracies enter a route of political experimentation that challenges the status quo while others remain ‘trapped’ in an orthodox neoliberal settlement? Our argument is that for a democratic polity to initiate a transition from neoliberal rule, there needs to be a crisis of neoliberal rule, a compelling alternative willing to contend for state power in national elections, and a reliable democratic settlement that allows the victory of the challenger – that is, the alternative – over the neoliberal rulers.

This article tests the hypothesis that many of these children can ‘catch-up’, if in stable placements and secondary schools ‘apparently effective’ with other children with ‘similar’ difficulties. In a cohort of 542,998 16-year-old English children in mainstream schools, those in care for at least a year were on average 148,465 ranks behind their peers on measured attainment at age 7. At age 16, 21% of this group had ‘caught up’ improving their ranking by at least this amount. Allowing for covariates, we found that schools were differentially effective for disadvantaged pupil groups defined by eligibility for free school meals at age 7, in the bottom 3 deciles of attainment at entry to secondary school, or deemed ‘in need’ or as having behavioural, emotional or social difficulties. As predicted, the conditions for children in care catching up related to placement stability and measures of their school’s apparent impact on these disadvantaged groups. In the ‘worst’ conditions 4% caught up as against 52% in the ‘best’. The results support the hypotheses that best practice can reduce the educational gaps between children in care, other low attaining groups and their peers.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.06871806, 0.01714913, 0.20401239, 0.0, 0.0, 0.03487926, 0.0]",child_family,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01

Where hearing loss is severe or profound, audiological interventions and rehabilitation have limited impact. Hearing dogs offer an alternative, or additional, intervention. They live permanently with recipients, providing sound support and companionship. Methods A single-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the impacts of a hearing dog on mental well-being, anxiety, depression, problems associated with hearing loss (responding to sounds, fearfulness/social isolation), and perceived dependency on others. Participants were applicants to the UK charity ‘Hearing Dogs for Deaf People’. Eligibility criteria were as follows: first-time applicant; applying for a hearing dog (as opposed to other support provided by the charity). Participants were randomised 1:1 to the following: receive a hearing dog sooner than usual [HD], or within the usual application timeframe (wait-list [WL] comparator). The primary outcome was mental well-being (Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale) 6 months (T1) after HD received a hearing dog. The cost-effectiveness analysis took a health and social care perspective. Results In total, 165 participants were randomised (HD n = 83, WL n = 82). A total of 112 (67.9%) were included in the primary analysis (HD n = 55, WL n = 57). At T1, mental well-being was significantly higher in the HD arm (adjusted mean difference 2.53, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.79, p < 0.001).

Aim To synthesise evidence on identification of older people with frailty approaching end-of-life, and whether associated intervention improves outcomes. Design Systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42020462624). Data sources Six databases were searched, with no date restrictions, for articles reporting prognostic or intervention studies. Key inclusion criteria were adults aged 65 and over, identified as frail via an established measure. End-of-life was defined as the final 12 months. Key exclusion criteria were proxy definitions of frailty, or studies involving people with cancer, even if also frail. Results Three articles met the inclusion criteria. Strongest evidence came from one study in English primary care, which showed distinct trajectories in electronic Frailty Index scores in the last 12 months of life, associated with increased risk of death. We found no studies evaluating established clinical tools (e.g. Gold Standards Framework) with existing frail populations. We found no intervention studies; the literature on advance care planning with people with frailty has relied on proxy definitions of frailty. Conclusion Clear implications for policy and practice are hindered by the lack of studies using an established approach to assessing frailty. Future end-of-life research needs to use explicit approaches to the measurement and reporting of frailty, and address the evidence gap on interventions. A focus on models of care that incorporate a palliative approach is essential.","[0.0, 0.00188949, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.09041344, 0.00720725, 0.0, 0.00065151, 0.15936198, 0.0]",community_service,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

Many of these conceptions are unintended and may be prevented by providing access to contraception in the immediate postpartum period. Midwives in the hospital setting could potentially play a greater role in improving postnatal contraception information and provision. Aim We sought to implement and examine the success of a program training hospital-based midwives in immediate postpartum implant insertion. Methods This mixed methods study in two hospitals in New South Wales sought to explore the feasibility, acceptability and sustainability of a program that provided competency-based implant insertion training for midwives. The study documented training completion, implant insertion numbers and experience, and conducted end of study interviews with midwives and stakeholders. Findings Twenty-seven midwives undertook training and inserted 265 implants during the study period. Interviews with 13 midwives and 11 stakeholders concluded the program to be feasible and acceptable with midwives reporting high satisfaction from their involvement. All interviewees felt that midwives were well placed to insert implants, and reported that challenges around workload and opportunities for practice were generally manageable. It was recognised that sustainability of the program would require supportive policy and regular insertion opportunities. Conclusions Midwives successfully upskilled in implant insertions and there was widespread support for the program with expectations it would be sustained.

Much attention has been devoted to 'effective altruism', an outgrowth of the broader paradigm of 'effective' philanthropy which is aimed at addressing social problems using a businesslike , data-driven, outcome-oriented approach. Hierarchical in its decision-making structures and patterned after patriarchal social relations, effective altruism marginalises the weaker parties in the deliberations surrounding funding. The feminist ethics of care constitutes a formidable alternative because it emphasises contextuality, relationality and gender-equitable structures of care in philanthropy. Yet, apart from taking insufficient account of multiple identities, such as sexualities and race, class and caste, this paradigm overlooks hierarchical geographical and socio-spatial relations across the world and elevates household relations over community relations. More fundamentally, as a paradigm, care ethics portrays the existence and persistence of global inequalities and stratification as fortuitous, amenable to the care of the privileged.

Herein, we report a new segmental resection approach through piezo surgery that involves using a bone cutter, which can uniquely provide a soft tissue protective effect. Methods: This retrospective study involved the examination of 26 NTOS patients who underwent piezo surgery and another group of 30 patients who underwent FRR using the conventional technique. In the patient group that underwent piezo surgery, the rib was first resected into two pieces using a piezoelectric device and subsequently removed. In the patient group that underwent conventional surgery, the first rib was removed as one piece using a rib cutter and rongeurs. Results: The piezo surgery group had significantly shorter operative time (96.85 ± 14.66 vs. 143.33 ± 25.64 min, P < 0.001) and FRR duration (8.73 ± 2.11 vs. 22.23 ± 6.27 min, P < 0.001) than the conventional group. The posterior stump length of the residual rib was shorter in the piezo surgery group than in the conventional group (0.54 ± 0.19 vs. 0.65 ± 0.15 cm, P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in postoperative complications and scores of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, the Cervical Brachial Symptom Questionnaire (CBSQ), and the visual analog scale (VAS).

Our starting point is the influential idea that neoliberalism has a major role to play in state failure to control the pandemic. By implementing neoliberal reforms, states have ostensibly rendered themselves incapable of preventing or mitigating the viral outbreak. A focus on the British experience lends weight to this perspective. But when viewed in a comparative light, the picture is less straightforward. By comparing the British and Australian cases, we see a similar embrace of neoliberal reforms across the whole of government, yet with strikingly divergent outcomes. How can we account for this dramatic difference? To answer this question, we offer an enhanced state capacity framework to improve our understanding of diverse national responses to Covid-19. Our larger objective is to enrich the existing state capacity literature in two ways. First, we extend the existing state capacity framework by introducing a new category – salutary capacity – to encapsulate a state's ability to correct and counteract the course of a national health emergency.

Eight young people and twenty-six practitioners across three residential care services in Australia participated in this qualitative study. Framework analysis identifies that personalised engagement, a delicate balance between care and control, and perseverance through turbulent times are conducive to relationship-based practice in therapeutic residential care. Relationship-based practice is also found to be employed in a unique historical and relational context that demands mindful navigation through three specific professional boundary issues including self-disclosure, over-identification and physical contact. Against this context, relationship-based practice in therapeutic residential care is considered a ‘double-edged sword’, offering practitioners copious opportunities to build connections with young people in informal environments whilst needing to mitigate multiple ethical ambiguities. Implications for practice include the need to safeguard the ‘do no harm’ priority whilst resisting defensive or detached practice. Contextualising relationship-based practice within an ethical practice framework to embed ethics work in day-to-day practice becomes paramount.","[0.00135528, 0.02242256, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00601168, 0.0, 0.24142913, 0.01160302]",community_service,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

This paper reorientates the focus from women's underrepresentation to male overrepresentation and privilege, to identify and compare the causal mechanisms between the overrepresentation of men in two traditionally male dominated work places in Australia: politics and construction. By applying feminist institutionalism, masculinities and privilege, it argues the overrepresentation of men is linked to gendered rules that uphold hegemonic masculinities which produce masculine privilege and supports a gender hierarchy. Masculine privilege occurs via three mechanisms: 1. a culture of denial; 2. perceptions that rules are neutral, legitimate and applied objectively; 3. through backlash and resistance to keep the gender status quo in place. We argue the effects of privilege combine to act as a barrier to the attraction, retention and progression of women to both sectors and conclude that the masculine privilege provides a valuable lens to explore how male dominance operates within work sectors.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the economic effect of an increase in LARC uptake to international rates.Methods An economic model was designed to assess two scenarios, namely increasing the current rate of LARC uptake of 12.5% to the international benchmark of 14.8% among: (1) women currently using the oral contraceptive pill (OCP); and (2) women at risk of pregnancy and not using contraception. Model inputs included cost of contraceptive methods, discontinuation rates and abortion and miscarriage costs associated with unintended pregnancies.ResultsWomen who switch from an OCP to LARC would save A$114–157 per year. Those not currently using any contraception who adopt LARC would incur costs of A$36–194 per year, but would reap savings from the reduction in unintended pregnancies. Over 5 years there would be a net saving of A$74.4 million for Scenario 1 and A$2.4 million for Scenario 2.Conclusion Greater use of LARC would result in a net gain in economic benefits to Australia. These benefits are largely driven by women switching from an OCP to LARC who have reduced costs, as well as women wishing to avoid pregnancy who choose to use LARC rather than no method. This evidence will support women making an informed contraceptive choice and policy makers in increasing the accessibility of LARC.What is known about the topic?LARC is the most effective form of reversible contraception, but uptake in Australia is relatively low.What does this paper add?There are economic benefits to society for women w

Our study with a sub-national focus sheds important new light on the drivers and decision-making dynamics of exiting of coal power use in China. Based on a case study of closures of coal power plants in China's Guangdong province, we find that under certain circumstances, governments - especially those in the provincial and city levels - can and do act as change agents when it comes to retirement of coal fired power stations. Our study reveals a number of push and pull mechanisms that governments have utilized to overcome the resistance of incumbent power generation companies, primarily based on developmental considerations.

The country has a long history of water policy development while climate-related policies are also emerging at different levels of the new federal republic. It is unclear whether public policy is on the right track to ensure urban water security in the face of growing demand and increasingly variable supply. In this paper, we assess how Nepal's water policy is shaping urban adaptation. We focus on how policies have defined institutional arrangements for water supply and management, allocation of water rights, and the conservation of water source catchments. Policy attention to these issues is crucial for the adaptation of water systems to climate change. Drawing on the review of policy texts and the status of policy implementation in two towns (Dharan and Dhulikhel), we conclude that current policy frameworks and strategies neglect opportunities to facilitate urban water adaptation to climate change. The neglect is seen in escalating conflicts among institutions, an unclear framework for water rights, and inadequate incentives for catchment conservation. We highlight the need for a more coherent and risk sensitive approach to water policy, underpinned by deliberative, research-informed, and learning-based strategies. 摘要 zh 气候变化背景下, 尼泊尔的城市地区正面临越来越严重的水不安全。该国拥有悠久的水政策发展史, 同时, 与气候相关的政策也正出现于该国的不同层面。尚不清晰的是, 面临水需求上涨和日益变化的水供给时, 公共政策是否在确保城市水安全的正轨上。本文中, 我们评估了尼泊尔水政策如何影响城市适应(urban adaptation)。我们聚焦于政府如何定义水供应和管理方面的制度安排、水权分配以及水源流域的保护。对这些问题给予政策关注, 对气候变化下的水系统适应而言是关键的。基于对政策文本的分析和两城市(Dharan 和Dhulikhel)的政策落实状态, 我们的结论认为, 现有政策框架和策略忽视了一系列能促进气候变化下城市水适应的机遇。这种忽视体现在机构间冲突的加剧、水权框架的不清晰、以及用于流域保护的激励措施不足。我们强调需要一个更一致的、对风险保持敏感的水政策措施, 辅以商议性的、基于研究和学习的策略。 Resumen es Las regiones urbanas de Nepal se enfrentan a niveles crecientes de inseguridad hídrica en un clima cambiante. El país tiene una larga historia de desarrollo de políticas de agua, mientras que las políticas relacionadas con el clima también están surgiendo en diferentes niveles de la nueva república federal. No está claro si las políticas públicas están en el camino correcto para garantizar la seguridad hídrica urbana frente a la creciente demanda y la oferta cada vez más variable. En este documento, evaluamos cómo la política hídrica de Nepal está dando forma a la adaptación urbana. Nos enfocamos en cómo las políticas han definido los arreglos institucionales para el suministro y la gestión del agua, la asignación de derechos de agua y la conservación de las cuencas de captación de fuentes de agua. La atención política a estos temas es crucial para la adaptación de los sistemas de agua al cambio climático. Basándonos en la revisión de los textos de políticas y el estado de implementación de políticas en dos ciudades (Dharan y Dhulikhel), llegamos a la conclusión de que los marcos de políticas y las estrategias actuales ignoran las oportunidades para facilitar la adaptación del agua urbana al cambio climático. La negligencia se ve en la escalada de conflictos entre instituciones, un marco poco claro para los derechos de agua e incentivos inadecuados para la conservación de las cuencas hidrográficas. Destacamos la necesidad de un enfoque de la política del agua más coherente y sensible al riesgo, respaldado por estrategias deliberativas, informadas por la investigación y basadas en el aprendizaje.","[0.0225264505, 0.0, 5.28017457e-06, 0.00261682474, 0.0361026622, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0304334669, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00138533611]",politics,"[6.99485398e-06 9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06

The framework is intended as a guide for Australian organisations to work in safe and culturally appropriate ways to assist and enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with disability to make plans about their physical and mental health, wellbeing and future. The Our Ways to Planning framework is based on data collected via community-led research undertaken with Aboriginal people with disability and their family members and workers from five communities in New South Wales. Community mapping, an arts-based research method, was used to learn about the experiences of Aboriginal people with disability and their families regarding planning and access to services. Using iterative, thematic analysis, the research team identified core themes and concepts around which to structure the framework. The framework identifies three 'bridges' to organisational readiness for planning: knowledge, understanding and choice. It focuses on the importance of non-Aboriginal-led organisations learning from, and collaborating with, community-based Aboriginal-led organisations in order to build capacity in both types of organisations. The framework advocates for open and respectful organisational engagement with the needs of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people with disability. It also acknowledges the importance of developing an awareness of Aboriginal cultures, histories and points of view, given their influence on planning processes. The Our Ways to Planning framework provides a model for organisational capacity-building for effective planning that responds directly to the experiences and needs of Aboriginal people with disability, family membe

Calls for reforming residential care into therapeutic care have received growing attention in recent years. However, limited research data exists to inform how therapeutic care can be optimally implemented in residential care settings. This research draws on the first-hand experience of residential care practitioners to examine the barriers they experienced when implementing therapeutic care. Twenty-six practitioners across five different service strata (senior managers, therapeutic specialists, caseworkers, team leaders and direct care workers) from three Australian residential care organizations participated in semi-structured interviews. Framework analysis of the interview data indicated, whilst there was a strong consensus that therapeutic residential care should be underpinned by trauma-informed knowledge, its implementation is constrained by six barriers: (1) inconsistent understandings of how therapeutic care should be operationalized; (2) crisis-driven referrals and assessments; (3) problematic placement configuration and client mix; (4) inadequate workforce development; (5) the emotional cost of care; and (6) atrophied clinical support. These barriers call into question the extent to which therapeutic residential care is implemented as intended. Findings indicate that, to actualize the full potential of therapeutic residential care, substantial work is needed to provide a more translatable practice framework, strengthen referral and assessment processes, revitalize the workforce and elevate implementation efforts to a systemic level, bringing closer alignment between different se

It is increasingly recognized that not only the person with disability but also those around them are affected. The relationship between functional limitation (FL) of the older adults and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of their spouse is of interest. So too is the determination of the factors aside from FL that influence HRQoL. Methods The sample was derived from the 2013 National Health Service Survey conducted in Shaanxi Province in China. Married couples aged ≥ 60 years were selected (n = 3463). The European quality of life five dimensions (EQ-5D) and visual analogue scale were used to measure HRQoL. Results Both wife and husband reported lower HRQoL if either the male or female partner had some or serious FLs ( P < 0.001). Other factors associated with lower HRQoL of the spouse included age, lower educational level, presence of chronic disease, and lower household economic status. Family size was associated with wife's HRQoL only when the male had no FL and lived with another 1–2 persons, or when the male had some FLs and lived in a larger family (n ≥ 5). Residential status did not relate to the HRQoL of spouses regardless of FL status. Conclusions Older adults in Shaanxi province who have partners with FLs tend to report poorer EQ-5D, suggesting that couples amongst whom one has FL may be particularly vulnerable to lower HRQoL.","[0.0, 0.00456333, 0.01261414, 0.00867401, 0.0, 0.0, 0.06256408, 0.01960302, 0.0, 0.0, 0.03823979, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.47694918e-06 9.99999000e-01

The Anchal programme protects children through crèche-based supervision in an enclosed space run by locally recruited carers. It is unclear under what conditions the programme best operates to maximise protection. We conducted a process evaluation of Anchal to determine enabling factors and challenges to implementation. Methods Quantitative programme data were analysed to calculate metrics including child participation and fidelity of implementation to defined processes. Qualitative data collection with programme participants and implementers provided insights into barriers and enablers of implementation. Analysis was guided by the UK Medical Research Council’s process evaluation framework. Results Anchal operated 400 centres with an average of 22.2 children enrolled, as per target. However, daily attendance averaged lower than the 80% target. Children aged 1–2 years old, who are most at risk of drowning, were least likely to enrol and attend regularly due to low engagement with activities and parental concerns for safety. Greater distances and lower educational attainment in some regions reduced attendance and increased carer attrition. Conclusions The Anchal programme met most programme delivery targets. However, programme success could be improved through increasing supervision, providing communication training for implementing staff, designing programmes for children aged 1–2 years old, encouraging community ownership and providing child pick-up services.

The settlement sector is integral to Australia’s counter-slavery efforts, and yet, no Australian study has explicitly sought to explore how this group identifies and navigates modern slavery. This paper draws on surveys and interviews with workers in the New South Wales settlement sector, and offers new insights into how certain forms of modern slavery are understood and addressed by professionals working with newly arrived migrants. The findings of the study uncover some of the profound challenges staff encounter in detecting and responding to different exploitative practices. Furthermore, they underscore the significant disjunctions between existing legislative provisions that aim to address modern slavery, and the experiences and understandings of workers at the frontline of the issue. The study demonstrates the need for education and greater investment into modern slavery responses within the settlement sector, and multi-sectoral collaboration to proactively address the systemic issues engendering exploitation at a community level.","[0.04342608, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01598049, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01149437, 0.04624848, 0.04872161]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01

Globally, there is a dearth of health research on gender and ageing with substantial knowledge gaps in low and middle-income country contexts. Part of a wider investigation on health and ageing in Fiji, our objective was to identify and describe gendered differences in healthy ageing in this Pacific Island context which we believe to be the first such study in the Pacific region. Methods Applying a health systems lens, we used a mixed-methods approach, encompassing analysis of cause of death data; focus group discussion to gather community and family attitudes to health services; and policy analysis, and then used data triangulation techniques to draw out key themes and insights. Results We found that gender affects health outcomes among older persons, attitudes towards and experience of healthy ageing, and an older person’s access to and use of health services. We also found that while Fiji’s policy response to ageing has recognised the importance of gender, to-date there has been limited action to address gender differences. Gender (as oppose to sex differences) has direct and indirect implications for the health of older Fijians, while gendered inequalities and patriarchal norms appear to affect both men and women’s experience of ageing and the health system response. Further, gender and age discrimination may be intersecting, intensifying their separate effects. Conclusion This study demonstrates the feasibility and importance of applying a gender lens to the study of healthy ageing. Our findings from Fiji are like

Method A train the trainer model was utilised, whereby staff and disability stakeholders undertook competency-based training on delivering sexuality education to teachers and people with disability, then trained and supported teachers working in special disability schools to provide sexuality education to students. An evaluation explored the acceptability and effectiveness of the project, utilising baseline and endline surveys and interviews. Findings From 2016 to 2018, the CSE disability project reached teachers and students in nine special disability schools in Fiji. At project completion, teachers reported increased confidence overall in teaching about sexuality and relationships, and students demonstrated increased knowledge regarding puberty and body changes.

This article reports on findings from a mixed methods evaluation of a programme trialled in Queensland, Australia. The programme was funded by the Commonwealth Department of Social Services as part of the Keeping Women Safe in Their Home initiative. The trial was comprised of two components: the provision of personal safety alarms and security cameras to victims, and the resourcing of service providers to identify and respond to technology-facilitated abuse experienced by their clients. The findings from the evaluation of the trial contribute to an emerging evidence base on technology as a means to support and increase the safety of victims of violence. The findings also contribute to evidence on the capacity of the sector to respond to the use of technology to harass, monitor and stalk victims.There are benefits to clients and service providers from the innovative use of technology as part of a holistic and flexible domestic and family violence service response to meet the needs of victims, including those who wish to remain in their home. However, service providers in the trial felt less confident in supporting victims of technology-facilitated abuse. The limited uptake of strategies provided to assess and monitor technology-facilitated abuse indicates that support workers in the domestic violence sector would benefit from capacity building in this area.

This research was commissioned to address major gaps in the evidence about technology-facilitated abuse against women with intellectual or cognitive disability. The report reveals that the tactics used for technology-facilitated abuse of women with intellectual or cognitive disability are like those faced by all women, but there are some unique differences. Summary of key findings: Women's experiences Technology featured in the women’s lives in important ways. They used a variety of digital devices and platforms to connect with friends, family and partners as well as access information and services. In some instances, perpetrators could remove technology from these women, which could impact their autonomy, wellbeing and safety. The women had experienced a range of abuses, from general harassment to misuse of their online accounts, being monitored using spyware and tracking devices, and having their intimate images or videos shared without their consent. While most commonly the perpetrator was a partner or ex-partner, they included family members, carers and strangers. Barriers to support: Fear was a primary barrier for the women in seeking help for technology-facilitated abuse, including fear of having digital devices, apps and internet access removed, or of not being believed. In some instances, a woman’s situation was further complicated because her partner was also her carer. Women could feel trapped by needing to maintain access to their children

When governments around the world imposed lockdown measures to curb the spread of COVID‐19, advocates in the domestic and family violence (DFV) sector recognised that these measures were likely to result in increases in violence against women, particularly intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV can take many forms, including physical, emotional, psychological, financial, coercive controlling behaviours, surveillance and isolation tactics. Lockdown conditions provide fertile ground for the exercise of coercive control by encouraging people to stay at home, limiting social interactions to household members, reducing mobility and enabling perpetrators to closely monitor their partner's movements. However, media reports and awareness of IPV are generally dominated by a focus on physical violence and lethality, which are easily defined and measured. By contrast, coercive control as a concept is difficult to operationalise, measure and action in law, policy and frontline interventions. This paper discusses the challenges inherent in measuring coercive control and engages with current debates around the criminalisation of coercive control in NSW. Such reflection is timely as the conditions of COVID‐19 lockdowns are likely to lead to an increase in coercive controlling behaviours.","[0.00361399, 0.05086089, 0.10515406, 0.03517862, 0.00345543, 0.0, 0.00836953, 0.02697163, 0.0, 0.02769233, 0.0, 0.02934555]",covid,"[9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01

PD has become economically important since introduction of an exotic vector, glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS). However, achieving resistance to vector acquisition and inoculation is hampered by lack of knowledge of the Xf inoculation mechanism, despite nearly 70 years of research on this topic. Recent work suggests that bacterial cells spread from the cibarium (the retention reservoir) into the precibarium, from which inoculation occurs. Backus's recently published salivation-egestion hypothesis for inoculation proposes that saliva is brought up into the precibarium, where it is mechanically swept across taste organs by the precibarial valve. This mechanical action, combined with the enzymatic action of the saliva, dislodges bacteria in the precibarium, which are then forcefully egested (expelled) out of the stylets in a mixture of plant fluid and saliva that enters a xylem cell. The present preliminary study tested whether Xf bacteria can penetrate existing, hardened GWSS salivary sheaths. GWSS were allowed to feed for 24 hours on a grape stem, depositing salivary sheaths. After the insects were removed, the stem was needle-inoculated with Xf in the feeding area, then immunoprobed for Xf and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results showed Xf-lined needle punctures into xylem cells. Xf bacteria were drawn into xylem vessels and traveled varying distances from the punctures. Bacteria encountered and penetrated into undamaged, existing sheath saliva in xylem cells.

These arduous experiences often translate into a strong determination to access education and persevere with tertiary studies. Supportive educational trajectories are crucial to increase social cohesion and help redress the personal and social disadvantages SRABs face. Yet, there is virtually no attention paid to aspirations about progression to postgraduate studies despite the diverse aspirations and talents of many. This article reports on a qualitative study that explored the perspectives of six SRABs and two academics at an Australian university on aspirations to postgraduate studies. Participants identified several obstacles and opportunities at personal, institutional, community, and policy levels. Many existing recommendations in the enabling pathways literature focus on what universities could do differently, but we argue for a whole-of-person approach that considers institutional as well as personal issues, to increase prospects of SRABs progressing to postgraduate studies. Universities can assist with better institutional support structures, mentoring, raising staff awareness about SRABs, and financial aid. While institutions might not be able to directly address financial, visa, and personal concerns, universities can implement simple strategies to minimise their impact.","[0.01236451, 0.0, 0.02042063, 0.01766028, 0.01065528, 0.13581401, 0.00073702, 0.0, 0.01666182, 0.00104848, 0.03546521, 0.0]",education,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01

The article suggests that a felt awareness arising from an understanding of interconnectedness is often inhibited or obscured due to an inscribed logic emanating from industrial capitalism. This logic broadly dominates the individual and commonly shared spaces, and creates a distance that inhibits a felt relation with the life-sustaining aspects of objects from developing. The article explores how humans construct value and a commensurate morality towards objects, and how the neoliberal logic suppressing notions of interconnectedness is inhibiting the capacity of the institutional human rights and environmental domains to engender broad-based action. The article critiques this logic by drawing on logic emanating from indigenous spaces, where certain indigenous ways of object- imagining and relation more clearly reveal social and environmental interconnectedness, providing instructive lessons on the connection between a felt relation and responsiveness.

However, use of this method in Australia is low. To better understand women’s views and experiences of the female condom, we conducted an interventional cross-sectional study. Methods Cisgender women ≥16 years, heterosexually active and living in New South Wales were recruited through social media advertisements and email invitations to clients of a family planning service. Eligible participants were provided with three female condoms and invited to complete a follow-up survey. Survey responses for women who attempted to use at least one female condom were summarised using counts and proportions. Results We recruited 556 women; few (30/556) had used the female condom before the study. There were 284 women who used, or attempted to use, a female condom during the study and completed the follow-up survey. Fifty-one percent (104/205) reported experiencing some difficulty in insertion, although only 46% (130/284) had seen an instructional demonstration. Approximately half (105/204) of women rated the sensation and comfort of the female condom as the same or better than the male condom, and 66% (137/204) reported that it provided the same or better lubrication. Approximately half of women said they would consider using the female condom again for STI prevention (51% (133/260)) or contraception (40% (103/260)), or would recommend to others (43% (112/260)). Conclusion Findings highlight the need for increased health promotion and education regarding use of the female condom.

In 2015, thousands of Rohingya became stranded in the Bay of Bengal when smugglers abandoned them on unseaworthy boats and regional governments refused their disembarkation. Their ordeal made headlines across the globe and photographs documenting the crisis were widely disseminated. This paper applies visual-social semiotics to four of these photographs from an Agence France-Presse public exhibition. Our analysis suggests that the features in the photographs transcend the conventional “threat versus victim” dualism that typically characterizes such representations, to capture both the suffering and agency of the people at the centre of the crisis. This occurs in two ways: first, the Rohingya are depicted as proactive and enacting agency, and not just as powerless people in need of rescue. Second, the juxtaposition of mundane aspects with more dramatic frames offers a tangible pathway for viewers to connect with the circumstances of the people depicted. These visual representations were effective in triggering international concern and policy responses in 2015. However, such photographs’ longer-term potential for shifting public perceptions of displacement and forced migration—and by extension, effective policy measures—remains largely indeterminate.","[0.02605289, 0.00840904, 0.01822372, 0.00692416, 0.00574656, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00129138, 0.01487627, 0.03551189, 0.00459938]",community_service,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

Educational institutions around the world have stressed online learning programs in the aftermath of the pandemic. However, because of insufficient access to ICT, a substantial number of students failed to harness the opportunity of online learning. This study explores the latent digital divide exhibited during the COVID-19 pandemic while online learning activities are emphasized among Bangladeshi students. It also investigates the digital divide exposure and the significant underlying drivers of the divide. A cross-sectional survey was employed to collect quantitative data mixed with open-ended questions to collect qualitative information from the student community. The findings revealed that despite the majority of students have physical access to ICT but only 32.5% of students could attend online classes seamlessly, 34.1% of the students reported the data prices as the critical barrier, and 39.8% of students identified the poor network infrastructure is the significant barrier for them to participate in online learning activities. Although most students possess physical access to the device and the Internet, they face the first-level digital divide due to the quality of access and maintaining subscriptions. Consequently, they fail to take advantage of physical access, resulting in the third-level digital divide (Utility Gap) and submerging them into a digital divide cycle.

The chapter discusses the history of online CSE, focusing on regulatory stances over time in which online risks to children have been cast as natural and inevitable by the hegemony of a “cyber-libertarian” ideology. We illustrate the success of this ideology, as well as its profound contradictions and ethical failures, by presenting key examples in which internet users have taken decisive action to prevent online CSE and promote the removal of CSAM. Rejecting simplistic characterizations of “vigilante justice,” we argue instead that the fact that often young internet users are being forced to act against online CSE and CSAM puts a lie to libertarian claims that internet regulation is impossible, unworkable, and unwanted. Recent shifts towards a more progressive ethos of online harm minimization are promising, however, this ethos risks offering a new legitimizing ideology for online business models that will continue to put children at risk of abuse and exploitation.

More specifically, it addresses President Jair Bolsonaro's foreign policy. His radical-right populist and religious-infused approach has been characterized by an explicit rejection of practically all elements of the LIO, including multilateralism, multiculturism, and regionalism-historically core features of Brazilian foreign policy. We seek to answer two interrelated questions: (1) what were the political conditions-domestic and international-that allowed for such dramatic foreign policy change? (2) what impact is Brazil's new foreign policy orientation having on the LIO? To address them, we resort to the aspirational constructivist theory, which has allowed us to theorize Brazil's new identity formation. We argue that Bolsonaro has reshaped Brazil's foreign policy as part of his endeavour to create a national self-image based on three pillars: anti-globalism, anti-Communism, and religious nationalism. By doing so, the Bolsonaro administration has transformed Brazil, otherwise an avid supporter of the LIO, into one of the order's most vocal critics. While anti-globalism (and, subsidiarily, anti-Communism) undermines the normative and institutional foundations of the LIO, religious nationalism offers a replacement to the order, based on independent ethno-nationalist communities. If Brazil's radical right populist model spreads across Latin America, it has the potential to hollow out the region's support to the LIO.","[0.05600036, 0.0, 0.00482066, 0.01137679, 0.0039544, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00088677, 0.00319211, 0.00934753]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

The strongest factors in enabling agency were social support and sexuality education. However, several barriers including paternalist attitudes and infantilization of young people with intellectual disability affected all aspects of sexual expression, leading to the persistence of unfair and avoidable health inequities over the past two decades.Conclusions Ensuring young people with intellectual disability have a voice on all matters affecting their bodies, even if they have high support needs, is essential to promoting sexual and reproductive health and rights for all.Policy ImplicationsAnti-ableist policies in sexual and reproduction health (e.g., education curriculum, service delivery) are key to moving forward.","[0.0, 0.33626358, 0.00356347, 0.0, 0.0, 0.03879517, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00342247, 0.0, 0.08512291, 0.0]",sexuality,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01

Strengths‐based approaches offer a different perspective by promoting a set of values that recognise the capacities and capabilities of Indigenous peoples. In this article, we seek to understand the conceptual basis of strengths‐based approaches as currently presented in health research. We propose that three main approaches exist: ‘resilience’ approaches concerned with the personal skills of individuals; ‘social–ecological’ approaches, which focus on the individual, community and structural aspects of a person's environment; and ‘sociocultural’ approaches, which view ‘strengths’ as social relations, collective identities and practices. We suggest that neither ‘resilience’ nor ‘social–ecological’ approaches sufficiently problematise deficit discourse because they remain largely informed by Western concepts of individualised rationality and, as a result, rest on logics that support notions of absence and deficit. In contrast, sociocultural approaches tend to view ‘strengths’ not as qualities possessed by individuals, but as the structure and character of social relations, collective practices and identities. As such, they are better able to capture Indigenous ways of knowing and being and provide a stronger basis on which to build meaningful interventions.","[0.03725435, 0.01477859, 0.00954543, 0.0, 0.01841922, 0.0, 0.00561424, 0.0, 0.00696002, 0.0, 0.09581835, 0.0]",community_service,"[6.92007374e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

The best model system for these studies is inoculation of the Pierces disease bacterium, Xylella fastidiosa (Xf), by vectors such as the glassy-winged sharpshooter GWSS). Research on the egestion-salivation hypothesis for Xf inoculation is presented. Two important steps in this hypothesis are: 1) uptake of saliva containing the cell wall-degrading enzyme beta-1,4 glucanase into the vectors precibarium, causing the Xf colonies attached therein to loosen from the cuticle, followed by 2) injection of saliva containing loosened bacteria into the xylem prior to ingestion. To directly test the likelihood that Xf could survive in and migrate out of saliva following inoculation, immunohistology was used to study interactions between Xf and GWSS saliva in grapevine. Adult GWSS were confined in small cages on grapevine stems for 24 hours and allowed to probe, leaving salivary sheaths in the plant. Xf was then needle-inoculated into the same stem area; 1 hour later, the tissue was excised and prepared for immunohistology using a commercial Xf probe. Xf bacteria observed in xylem cells penetrated the semi-viscous saliva deposited during GWSS probing prior to Xf inoculation. Therefore, Xf bacteria have the ability to infiltrate gelled saliva containing salivary glucanase.

This paper argues that the language of multistakeholderism and technological solutionism obscures the administrative and commercial practices that facilitate the widespread distribution of abuse material. To illustrate this point, the paper describes the 2019 intervention of the Canadian Centre for Child Protection in the operations of “Trichan”, three websites that were amongst the largest purveyors of abuse material on the open web for 7 years. The case study underscores the materiality of the Internet and the role of commercial relations within the infrastructure stack in the provision of illegal content. While identifying opportunities for the mass removal of abuse material, the paper questions the discretion granted to technology companies under laissez faire regulation, and troubles characterizations of Internet infrastructure as neutral and instrumental factors in the epidemic availability of abuse material. 摘要 zh 在有关网络儿童性虐待内容盛行的新一轮关切中，全球科技部门正重新聚焦于多利益攸关方治理的模式和新技术解决措施的发展。本文主张，多利益攸关方主义（multi‐stakeholderism）和技术解决主义（technological solutionism）的表达方式模糊了那些帮助广泛散布虐待内容的管理实践和商业实践。为阐明这一点，本文描述了2019年加拿大儿童保护中心在“Trichan”操作中的干预，Trichan是7年来开放网络（open

The traditional story – of a game created by ‘gentlemen’ but taken up, and ultimately dominated, by ‘ruffians’ – has been challenged by a revisionist account which presents football as an ancient ‘people’s’ or ‘plebeian’ game, briefly hijacked by upper-middle class men in the mid-Victorian period, before returning to its ‘popular’ roots from the 1880s onwards. This article suggests that, as currently conducted, the debate is both conceptually confused and bedevilled by paucity of sources. The conceptual problems derive partly from an endemic vagueness in the historical use of the term ‘football’, and partly from a persistent tendency to conflate football play with rules of play. The paucity of sources is well-known in the study of football as a medieval and early modern folk pastime. But it is also an issue in studying early forms of club football. This article uses a hitherto underused source – the match reports of the earliest amateur football clubs in Britain – as part of an attempt to address the conceptual confusion and also to present a genuinely new account of the impact of traditional ‘folk’ football on the modern game. It is suggested that the impact was both real and very short-lived.","[0.03413578, 0.00334453, 0.00835994, 0.00406892, 0.0, 0.00782307, 0.00426689, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01611477, 0.00025608, 0.00020812]",politics,"[1.35769038e-05 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

No drowning interventions are currently implemented in India. Interventions that build on existing policy targets or government programs are more likely to be sustainable and scalable. Methods For the first time to our knowledge for an injury-related issue in India, detailed content review of policy was conducted to identify both policy principles and/or specific government programs that may be leveraged for drowning interventions. The reach, enablers and barriers of these programs were assessed through a systematic literature review. Identified policies and programs were also assessed on how they catered for underserved groups and took into consideration equity. Results Three programs may be leveraged for drowning interventions: The Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), Self-Help Group (SHG) and Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) programs. All three had high coverage and considered underserved groups such as women and rural populations. Conclusions Programs targeting specific health outcomes should consider interventions outside of the health sector that address social determinants of health. This may enable the program to better align with relevant government agendas and increase sustainability. Key messages This is the first systematic analysis of both policy content and execution of government programs to provide comprehensive insights into possible implementation strategies for an injury intervention.

The paper draws on submissions to the 2018 Australian Senate Parliamentary Inquiry into Adoption Reform from Aboriginal community controlled organizations and highlights four common themes evident throughout these submissions: (i) the role of intergenerational trauma in high rates of Aboriginal child removal; (ii) the place of children within Aboriginal culture, kinship and identity; (iii) the centrality of the principles of self-determination and autonomy for Aboriginal communities and (iv) Aboriginal community controlled alternatives to child removal.

Women impacted by significant mental distress, disability, or refugee status are among society’s most vulnerable and disenfranchised groups. They can experience significant social exclusion, marginalisation and stigma, associated with reduced help seeking, deprivation of dignity and human rights, and threats to health, well-being and quality of life. Previous research has assessed the experiences of discrete groups of women but has to date failed to consider mental health–refugee–disability intersections and overlaps in experience. Using body mapping, this research applies an intersectional approach to identify how women impacted by significant mental distress, disability, and refugee status negotiate stigma and marginalisation. Findings on strategies to cope with, negotiate and resist stigmatised identities will inform health policy and yield targeted interventions informed by much-needed insights on women’s embodied experience of stigma. The women’s body maps will be exhibited publicly as part of an integrated knowledge translation strategy. The aim is to promote and increase sensitivity and empathy among practitioners and policy makers, strengthening the basis for social policy deliberation.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.06240112, 0.24375465, 0.0, 0.0012592, 0.00248602, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07082912, 0.00268358]",women,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.96204863e-04

Within this body of law, a host of crimes are listed as prohibited, and if committed, could land individuals before national or international courts. While the legal categorisation of violence into discrete crimes serves the procedural justice of the courtroom, it simultaneously erases the overlapping, entangled, and messy practice of violence. In this paper, I engage in a queer (re)imagining of the legal category of the crime of torture, as defined and practiced at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). A queer reading of witness testimonies reveals the multiplicities and contingencies that constitute torture, but also exposes the logics of gender and sexuality that make the practice and prosecution of torture legible. I argue that the ICTY jurisprudence both erases and embraces the complicated ways that torture is practiced and embodied.

Globally, indigenous peoples experience a disproportionate burden of chronic disease and poor nutrition is a major risk factor. Indigenous leaders have been advocating for community-led solutions. The primary aim of this systematic review is to determine what community-led programs have been undertaken to address food and/or water security globally.

The grey literature search will include grey literature databases, customised Google search engines, targeted websites, and consultation with experts. The search strategy will consist of four concepts, combined as follows: (1) indigenous peoples AND (2) community program AND (3) food security OR (4) water security. Covidence will be used for study screening and data extraction by two authors. A deductive thematic analysis using indigenous-informed methodologies will be used to synthesise data.

Yet, despite the global attention afforded to #MeToo, it was preceded by numerous initiatives, which we argue created digital footprints instrumental in rendering #MeToo intelligible. As such, the aim of this article is two-fold. Firstly, it offers the first attempt to map a diverse range of initiatives which have mobilized to fight sexual violence, and in doing so, makes visible the global genealogy of digital feminist activism responding to sexualised violence. Secondly, building on these digital footprints and looking towards the future of digital feminist activism, the article demonstrates the power and potential of initiatives that expose the structural conditions enabling sexual violence to occur through the collective sharing of experiences across cybernetworks via processes of “ethical witnessing.” We conclude by advocating for greater recognition of those voices and experiences that feminist scholars and activists alike continue to fail to witness and call for greater efforts to archive the genealogy of digital feminist mobilisation in order to capture the complexity and diversity of its past, present and future.","[0.02087221, 0.1631713, 0.0, 0.01306229, 0.01576688, 0.03789836, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00467362, 0.0, 0.03105775]",sexuality,"[1.10562663e-04 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 7.46208686e-06

While the ICTY has officially ceased operations, the implications of the Tribunal’s closure continue to manifest in contemporary settings of transitional justice. Embracing a queer approach to time, the ICTY can be better understood as temporally fluid, open, and contested, rather than confined to its establishment and closure. This is because as a site for the (re)production and (re)presentation of discourses, the ICTY transcends temporal boundaries, continuing to shape and constitute (post-)conflict and transitional contexts. In this paper, I deploy queer approaches to time to interrogate how discourses of gender, sexuality, and violence at the ICTY traverse legal-political temporalities. Using the Tribunal’s Srebrenica remembrance as a case study, I demonstrate how gendered and sexualised logics constituted at the ICTY exceed the Tribunal’s official temporal mandate.

Due to the unprecedented health risks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, 188 nations across the globe have implemented a safety regulation prohibiting direct instruction in educational institutions. Most countries have adopted online classes as a substitute for traditional face-to-face classes (Petretto et al., 2020). This indicates that perhaps this pandemic will lead to long-term reformation in the future education system, making online learning-teaching an integral part of traditional education in the future. For example, according to the UN (2020), numerous higher education programs have successfully been implemented online. According to UN (2020) data, approximately all European and Latin American countries have adopted online learning amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, approximately 60% of African countries have introduced online learning, which is significantly lower. Although online classes seemly effective, this introduces new forms of inequalities (Badiuzzaman et al., 2021; Petretto et al., 2020; UNESCO, 2020). UNESCO has warned that considering online learning as the way ahead for everyone is a delusion (UNESCO, 2020). Empirical evidence found that many students are deprived of onlineclasses in developing countries due to various forms of the digital divide (Badiuzzaman et al., 2021; UN, 2020). Along with these digital divide issues, lack of interaction in class, lack of technical skills of teachers and students, dearth of parental awareness cumulatively affecting the utility of online classes.

In rural and remote Aboriginal communities, blindness prevalence is higher, and ocular treatment coverage and uptake are lower. In collaboration with Aboriginal Community Based Researchers (CBRs), this study explored complex contingent factors that shape access to eye health services for rural and remote Aboriginal Australians living with diabetes. Interviews (n = 126) and focus groups (n = 12) were conducted with patients, primary care clinicians, and CBRs, in four rural communities in the Northern Territory and New South Wales. Factors internal and external to health systems were examined, drawing on Bourdieu's concepts of habitus, and doxa to understand agency and decision-making among patients and clinicians. The study used the ontology of critical realism, categorising contingent factors as underlying structures (generative mechanisms), and applying a decolonising approach that centred causal relationships and tensions between dominant (Western biomedical neoliberalism) and non-dominant (Aboriginal) value systems. Three forms of marginalisation; linguistic, economic, and cultural, were identified as the generative mechanisms that inhibit equitable eye health outcomes. Marginality is linked to structural factors that position Aboriginal culture as a barrier, and is reinforced through biomedical health systems, and the agents who operate in and influence them.

Interviews were conducted with nine family members of 11 people with disability from Iraqi and Syrian refugee backgrounds; eight Iraqi and Syrian community organization leaders; and seven community and health refugee service practitioners. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using the thematic analysis. Three themes were identified that contribute to understandings of disability based on the perceptions of the multiple stakeholders interviewed: Iraqi and Syrian perceptions of ‘disability’; beliefs about who is ‘responsible for’ the disability; and comparisons between Iraqi/Syrian and Australian views, attitudes, and approaches to disability. Understandings of disability are shaped by fluid and dynamic factors, including culture.

We will develop this relational understanding through a reading of the work of Martin Buber, a social philosopher primarily interested in dialogue, meeting, relationship, and the irreducibility and incomparability of reality. In particular, the article contrasts Buber’s work with that of poststructuralist theorists who take as their starting point the deconstruction of the Hegelian logic of binary oppositions. Deconstruction understands difference as the excess that undoes the binary, but Buber, we argue, shows how difference derives from the primacy and ontological undefinability of relation.

However, the conventions of data visualisation have been criticised for their reductiveness and rhetoric of neutrality and there have been recent efforts to develop feminist principles for designing data visualisations that are compatible with feminist epistemologies. In this article, we aim to examine how data visualisation is used in feminist activism and by feminist activists. Drawing on the example of digital street harassment activism, we analyse how street harassment is visualised in and through a selection of prominent activist social media accounts. We consider the platform affordances utilised by activists, and how these are harnessed in making street harassment ‘knowable'. Moreover, we critically interrogate which and whose experiences are ‘knowable’ via digital techniques, and what remains obscured and silenced. In analysing digital feminist activists’ practices, we argue that what constitutes ‘data visualisation’ itself must be situated within feminist epistemologies and praxis that centre lived experience as the starting point for knowledge production. Such an approach challenges and disrupts normative constructions of what constitutes data visualisation. Our findings demonstrate how feminist activists are adopting ‘traditional’ practices of speaking out and consciousness-raising to the digital sphere in the creation of a range of visualisations that represent the issue of street harassment. We consider the efficacy of these visualisations for achieving their intended purpose and how they might translate to policy and government responses, if this is indeed their goal.

Educational institutions around the world have stressed online learning programs in the aftermath of the pandemic. However, because of insufficient access to Information Communication Technology (ICT), a substantial number of students failed to harness the opportunity of online learning. This study explores the latent digital divide exhibited during the COVID-19 pandemic while online learning activities are emphasised among students of Bangladesh. It also investigates the digital divide exposure and the significant underlying drivers of the divide. In order to accomplish this, a cross-sectional survey was employed to collect quantitative data, mixed with open-ended questions were utilised to gather qualitative information from the student community. The findings revealed that despite the majority of students having physical access to ICT, only 32.5% of students could attend online classes seamlessly. In total, 34.1% reported data prices as the critical barrier, while 39.8% identified poor network infrastructure as the significant barrier preventing them from participating in online learning activities. Although most students possess physical access to various devices and the Internet, they face the first-level digital divide due to the quality of access and price of cellular Internet. Consequently, they fail to take advantage of physical access, resulting in the third-level digital divide (utility gap), which submerges them into a digital divide cycle.

This typically, though not always, involves the constitutional recognition of the religion shared by the historically dominant group in a society, a recognition not given to minority religions. De Vries’ objection to 'mono-recognition' is not, however, the usual arguments levelled against it. Rather, he claims to offer a novel argument showing that mono-recognition is ‘pro tanto wrong’, that is, wrong as far as it goes and until it can be otherwise justified. His argument is that it is enough that some citizens desire constitutional recognition for their religion on morally reasonable (or at least on not unreasonable) grounds for the non-recognition of their religion to be wrong. De Vries’ intervention is useful as a cautionary tale about how not to think about religious recognition and fairness in liberal democracies. It supplies three lessons. The first is that one should not try to resolve these issues in total disregard of a society’s history and culture. Lesson two is not to fixate on constitutional recognition as there are different ways of effecting political recognition and promoting a sense of belonging in a diverse society. Third, De Vries’ article inadvertently highlights the practical and moral dilemmas involved in trying to distribute recognition in a mechanical or uniform fashion. Assessing the legitimacy of the political recognition of religion and religious minorities requires a much more nuanced and context-sensitive approach than the one De Vries presents, a tiptoeing rather than a pro tantoing through the tulips.","[0.04880625, 0.01259692, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

This article examines two key frameworks which govern ethics in sexual violence research: institutional risk management and trauma discourse. While recognising the importance of these frameworks, we argue that they share a narrow conceptualisation of the potential harms of sexual violence research. Drawing on the legacy of decades of feminist research on sexual violence, we call for a deeper engagement with ethical and epistemological questions of knowledge, positionality and power. We argue that researchers need to consider the broader social and political contexts that shape survivors’ lives and experiences of disclosure in undertaking ethical research. Sexual violence researchers must also consider the potential harms of their research on marginalised communities – from questioning who is included in research, to the implications of the responses to violence advocated for.

To better understand young people’s views and experiences of sexual health education in NSW, a student needs assessment survey was conducted in 2017. Methods This paper presents the findings from 1,603 NSW students in Years 8-12 following online recruitment. Descriptive analyses explored students’ views and experiences in relation to sources of sexual health information, education providers, school-based topics covered and resources drawn on. Results Findings indicate that school, parents, friends and social media are students’ most common sources of information on sexual and reproductive health. Approximately one-third of students reported wanting more information on topics related to relationships, reproductive health, consent and sexual decision-making and sexual harassment, abuse and bullying, and two-thirds of transgender and gender diverse students wanted more information on gender identity. For the topics which students reported receiving the least information about at school, they were most likely to seek this out on social media and websites. Conclusion Findings provide valuable insight for improving CSE in NSW. The influence of social media, parents and the internet should be taken into consideration when developing resources and programme content. Professional development for educators could contribute to improving the quality of CSE delivered.

However, soon after the outbreak of COVID-19, Australia took an increasingly assertive stance toward China, one that is arguably even more assertive than those of its Western allies. What prompted Australia to adopt a tougher policy against China? This article argues that COVID-19 has brought significant uncertainty to the international system and, hence, to Australia’s external environment, which has affected the country’s decision-making, accelerating the formation of a hardline policy toward China. A contributing factor behind this policy is Australia’s quest for ontological security, which, in the context of COVID-19, has triggered a rise in anti-China sentiment. Meanwhile, this strategy backfired when it encountered China’s own nationalism, which exacerbated the widening political chasm, dragging the two countries into an unprecedented diplomatic confrontation. The core of ontological security lies in maintaining the stability of the identity needed for the formation of consistent policy. The uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic have changed the familiar external environment and challenged Australia’s ability to interpret this new environment and adjust to it, which has triggered ontological insecurity. By analyzing Australia’s identity as a middle power in the context of changing regional security and its commitment to certain values, the article shows how COVID-19 has accelerated Australia’s quest for ontological security, which has changed the country’s China policy.","[0.03766283, 0.0, 0.11341002, 0.01634028, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02760229, 0.00862993, 0.0, 0.0]",covid,"[9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06

Although tissue-engineered nerve grafts (TENGs) with sustained release of neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are experimentally proved to be more effective than these blank conduits, there remains a lack of clinical translation. NTFs are typically immobilized onto scaffold materials of the conduit via adsorption, specific binding or other incorporation techniques. These scaffold-based delivery strategies increase complexity and cost of conduit fabrication and lack flexibility in choosing different drugs. Therefore, to facilitate clinical translation and commercialization, we construct a TENG using a scaffold-independent drug delivery system (DDS). Approach: This study adopted a scaffold-independent DDS based on methoxy-poly (ethylene glycol)-b-poly(γ-ethyl-L-glutamate) (mPEG-PELG) thermosensitive hydrogels that undergo sol-to-gel transition at body temperature. In addition, TENG, a chitosan scaffold filled with nerve growth factor (NGF)-loaded mPEG-PELG that gel in the lumen upon injection during surgery and function as a drug-releasing conduit-filler, was designed. Subsequently, the efficacy of DDS and therapeutic effects of TENG were assessed. Main results: The results demonstrated that NGF-loaded mPEG-PELG controllably and sustainably released bioactive NGF for 28 d. When bridging a 10 mm rat sciatic nerve gap, the morphological, electrophysiological, and functional analyses revealed that NGF-releasing TENG (Scaffold + NGF/mPEG-PELG) achieved superior regenerative outcomes compared to plain scaffolds and those combined with systemi

This chapter provides an overview of central debates and approaches used in the subdiscipline over the past century. These debates – ranging from the form and substance of the economy, the impact of the cultural turn, and the rise of neoliberal economic policy – are explored amid changing relationships with credit and debt following the global financial crisis (GFC). Positioned between anthropology and economics, the field of economic anthropology has long sought to understand notions of exchange, ownership, consumption, value, reciprocity, production, and labor and considers how these relate to the function and maintenance of distinct cultural worlds. Analyzing central debates in historical perspective, this chapter asks how practitioners continue to engage with key ideas after the GFC. What is more, it decenters key theoretical approaches by examining the experience of the GFC from outside the global centers of finance. Through a case study of the Icelandic banking collapse as part of the GFC, questions of how credit and debt are understood in light of crisis are pursued, particularly after the collective prosperity of Iceland’s “economic miracle” in the early 2000s. It concludes with a discussion of the harms of neoliberalism and economic “virtualism” and charts emerging inquiries in economic anthropology that boast flexibility for examining economy in a changing world.","[0.07541959, 0.01201248, 0.01495132, 0.00480879, 0.0033159, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00929917, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",politics,"[6.66090214e-05 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

This study aimed to determine health professional knowledge of the renewed screening program following implementation. Methods: We invited health professionals providing cervical screening in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, to complete an online survey in late 2018, to better understand their knowledge of the renewed screening guidelines, in particular regarding screening of specific populations, and to ascertain whether they had undertaken any educational activities relevant to the renewal. Results: A total of 241 responses were included in the data analysis. Health professionals demonstrated good knowledge of some aspects of the renewed program, including 64–85% correctly identifying limited indications for testing people younger than 25 years, 87% correctly identifying the need for completion of the Test of Cure protocol following treatment of high-grade lesions, and 71–80% correctly identifying management of symptomatic women. However several key knowledge gaps were identified including management of immune-deficient women (only 37% of respondents were aware of the need for 3-yearly screening), screening after total hysterectomy (56% were aware of guidance) and approximately 66% of health professionals correctly identifying indications for self-collected screening. One in ten health professionals had not undertaken any education specific to the renewal of the program.

In so doing, they tend to focus on equal distribution of a set of rights and goods among the communities. However, these rights and goods are defined by an underlying value structure, and such structures tend to mirror the interests of the powerful groups in the community. The fundamental problem is that the equality of the rights and redistribution of the goods cannot remedy disaster injustices. Taking a case study from Nepal's earthquake 2015, this paper aims to link key works on disasters with justice theories - an attempt, which could help strengthen the conceptual foundations of policy responses to disaster recovery. We use the Nepal case of earthquake recovery to demonstrate the relevance of disaster justice lens which emphasizes the role of disaster justice champions, critical politics of knowledge, accountability, representation and disaster justice convictions. We demonstrate that the platform of critical knowledge politics is important where civic science and traditional science is deliberated, interrogated, negotiated and integrated. We argue that only when disaster justice champions with convictions of priority to the disadvantaged effectively utilizes the platform of critical knowledge politics, it is possible to influence political deliberations and decision making that can potentially enhance disaster justice in practice. Finally, and in a more theoretical sense, we argue that in order to enhance disaster justice, responses need to be informed by the understanding of ‘justice as redistribution’ as well as ‘justice as recognition’.","[0.0204272, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00127803, 0.23507452, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01581391, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00821824, 0.01167343]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

Drawing on practices of reflexivity, as well as comments made by participants across 46 qualitative interviews, I consider how digital mapping can be used to facilitate feminist research, arguing that it represents a generative instrument which lends itself to the development of in-depth insights from participants.

To date, no systematic review of the use of digital storytelling in a research capacity, to generate information about a phenomenon has been conducted. Accordingly, our aim was to provide a systematic review of digital storytelling in research. The review identified 25 articles representing 23 discrete studies that met inclusion criteria. A thematic analysis of results indicated that digital storytelling in research was especially appropriate for use with marginalised groups, and was most commonly used in this context. There was some variation in the extent to which digital storytelling in research adhered to the principles with which it was originally developed. Surprisingly, although digital storytelling provides a ready-made knowledge translation product, few research projects employed the digital stories generated to this end. Across research projects, participants reported several benefits of digital storytelling. While some disadvantages were noted, overall, these were outweighed by the benefits of using a respectful, participatory research practice. © 2017: Adële de Jager, Andrea Fogarty, Anna Tewson, Caroline Lenette, Katherine M.

It also helps with a successful transition to life after school. • We talked to 11 Australian high school girls with intellectual disability. We wanted to know what they think about their sex education at school. • The girls told us that they were often not included in Individual Learning Plan meetings. They were also not consulted about what they would like to learn in sex education. • Sex education classes were largely inaccessible for them. • Accessible sex education classes are important to prepare students for life after school. Abstract 1.1 Background Students with intellectual disability often do not receive holistic sex education, which is critical for their successful transition to post-school life, including having an ability to make healthy choices about their sexuality and relationships. The aim of this inclusive research study was to explore the perceptions and experiences of sex education with Australian high school girls with intellectual disability, as they prepare for a transition to post-school life. 1.2 Method There were 11 high school girls aged 13–20 years who participated in this study. Interviews were conducted and analysed using inductive content analysis. 1.3 Findings The findings indicate that critical topics such as gender and sexual identity, and masturbation are not sufficiently covered in sex education in New South Wales, Australia. The participating girls also highlighted ways in which teachers could make sex education lessons more accessible. Individual Learning Plan meetings, an important platform for transition planning, were attended by less than a third of the girls in this study. 1.4 Conclusions Comprehensive and accessible programmes on sex educati

Separately, the clinic files of 599 female carriers without a personal history of breast/ovarian cancer who underwent BRCA1/2 predictive genetic testing and received their results pre- and post-guideline were audited to ascertain the risk management advice given by health professionals.

Data were drawn from the three waves of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (2009, 2011, 2015) undertaken since health reforms commenced. χ2, Kruskal–Wallis test, and the Two-Part model were employed in the analysis. The overall reimbursement rate of the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) is higher than that of Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) or the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) (p < 0.001), but the gap has narrowed since health reform began in 2009. Both the outpatient and inpatient reimbursement amounts have increased through the URBMI and NRCMS. Illness severity, higher institutional level, and inpatient service were associated with significant increases in the amount of reimbursement received across the three survey waves. The health reform improved benefits covered by the URBMI and NRCMS, but gaps with the UEBMI still exist.

Method: In 2018, Family Planning NSW (funded by nib Foundation) delivered six workshops to parents and carers across NSW focussing on puberty, sexuality and relationships education for children and young people with ID and ASD. Pre and post workshop surveys were completed by participants (n = 116) with a three month follow-up via online survey or telephone interview to evaluate the effectiveness of the workshop. Quantitative data was analysed using STATA 14.0. Qualitative data was summarised by theme or analysed in Nvivo using thematic analyses. Results: A significant improvement in participants’ knowledge and confidence level in providing sexuality support to their child/young person between the pre- and post-workshop survey was found across survey respondents, with those gains retained at the three month follow up. Respondents also identified barriers in supporting their child or young person, including lack of understanding about how to adapt information effectively to their child’s needs, lack of time, and a scarcity of workshops and resources in regional areas. Implications: The provision of sexuality workshops to build the knowledge and confidence of parents and carers is highly valuable.

The veracity of the sceptical position has been subject to limited empirical scrutiny. The aim of this study is to analyse the content of a sample of 1004 images of pre-internet abuse material. The pre-internet sample was analysed according to the characteristics of victim/s, perpetrator/s and severity and setting of abuse, which were then compared to a pre-existing dataset of 34,561 contemporary abuse images. The findings of the study underscore the severity of pre-internet abuse material. The comparison between the pre-internet and contemporary sample found that the average age of girls abused in abuse material has decreased, and the severity of the material has increased. The study highlights the significant abuse experienced by abuse material victims prior to the internet, and suggests the popularisation of the internet is linked to a trend towards more serious offending against children in abuse material.

Using discourse analysis, this paper unpacks how Western logics (assumptions and conventions) regarding ‘best practices’ for property rights institutions and tenure security impact the design of peacebuilding programs. In 2017, the Government of Timor-Leste passed a controversial Land Law Package. These laws were initially developed for a USAID land reform program. But local dynamics, actions, and interests were ignored. Examining civil society exclusion from decision-making infers a reluctance to acknowledge local voices and practices that threaten liberal peacebuilding interests. This paper is organised into two parts. In the first, we argue that peacebuilding ‘best practices’ reflect how dominant Western discourses create conceptual boundaries (‘violent hierarchies’) to restrict the recognition of indigenous ideas as legitimate. In the second, we examine Timorese civil society efforts to improve the land reform program through acts of resistance to bodies of authority. Overall, we illuminate how in Timor-Leste Western assumptions and conventions contributed to boundaries to local participation, which contradicts liberal narratives of empowerment and capacity-building.","[0.05925844, 0.00030574, 0.0, 0.00523091, 0.04471549, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00354692, 0.00817987, 0.01162486, 0.0, 0.01775303]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 3.67337238e-06 3.76512122e-06

For young Indigenous gender and sexuality diverse peoples, heteronormative colonial value systems converge to produce environments characterised by racism, phobia and marginalisation. The evidence base includes deficit models based on trauma and negative outcomes. However, there is also an emerging body of research highlighting the resistance and resilience of Indigenous gender and sexuality diverse youth.","[0.0, 0.09576452, 0.0, 0.03189738, 0.03331574, 0.00619398, 0.00205933, 0.00286693, 0.01212206, 0.0, 0.07549961, 0.0]",sexuality,"[8.30423852e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

Elder-mediation has been identified as one promising method of alternative dispute resolution. This study aimed to investigate the accessibility of elder-mediation services among diverse groups of older adults, from the perspective of practitioners in a large Australian jurisdiction. Research design and methods: The study employed a sequential mixed-methods approach, comprising a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews (N=17) and an online survey of practitioners (N=49) involved in referral to, or provision of, elder-mediation services. Accessibility was conceptualized using existing theoretical frameworks, spanning practical (logistics-related) and normative (justice and culture-related) dimensions. Results: Factors limiting accessibility of elder-mediation services included lack of community and practitioner awareness of elder abuse and elder-mediation, discomfort with the mediation process, financial costs, lack of services in regional and remote areas and complex service systems for older people. Within the mediation process, difficulties in assessing and accommodating cognitive and other impairments, managing power imbalances and determining the appropriateness of the dispute for mediation were influential. Discussion and implications: This study showed that mediation can be a promising and effective approach to resolving disputes involving older people. The emergent perceptive dimension (community and practitioner awareness) emphasizes the importance of awareness raising efforts surrounding both elder abus

RC screening, that is, the use of routine, non-invasive screening questions asked of service users/clients, is one strategy that can be used to assess for RC. Routine screening for RC was implemented within Family Planning NSW clinical consultations in December 2018. A cross-sectional study was undertaken to review the outcomes of screening to better understand the situation of RC among women accessing family planning services. Methods: A retrospective review of clinical consultation data of eligible women attending Family Planning NSW clinics in 2019 was undertaken. Descriptive analysis was conducted and modified Poisson regression was used to estimate prevalence ratios and assess associations between binary outcomes and client characteristics. Results: Of 7943 women eligible for RC screening, 5497 were screened (69%) and 127 women (2.3%) disclosed RC. RC was more likely to be disclosed among clients who were unemployed, had a disability or had more than one visit within 1 year. Conclusions: Sexual and reproductive health clinicians, in particular, are well placed to conduct RC screening.

Further, scant research on sexual violence against men and boys in displacement contexts has been undertaken to date. To begin to address these knowledge gaps, we undertook a multicountry, qualitative, exploratory study to gain insights into these issues. Study settings and populations were Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh; refugees and migrants who had traveled through Libya residing in Italy; and refugees from eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Somalia, and South Sudan residing in Nairobi and Mombasa, Kenya. Methods included 55 semi-structured focus group discussions with 310 refugees and semi-structured key informant interviews with 148 aid workers 1 Women's Refugee Commission, 2 Journal of Interpersonal Violence and human rights experts. Data were thematically analyzed using NVivo 12. Findings suggest that sexual violence against men and boys may not be rare in Myanmar (northern Rakhine state), Libya, eastern DRC, and South Sudan. Frequently reported forms of violence in these settings were genital violence, forced witnessing of sexual violence, and rape. Sites where violence was often reported included border crossings, along the roadside, and during imprisonment. In host countries, forms of sexual violence included sexual abuse of boys, sexual exploitation particularly of adolescents and persons with diverse sexual orientation and gender identity, and rape. Impacts on survivors involved short-and long-term physical, mental, economic, and familial dimensions. These findings aim

We collaborated with the women to organise workshop activities and a community event to showcase their cultural artefacts and items created during the workshops. Through a research-arts partnership, we documented women’s conversations about their artistic and cultural traditions and practices during weekly gatherings and pre and post-workshop discussions. This paper suggests that the women involved in these participant-designed and driven workshops were redefining their culture and cultural practices in a different place, and shaped new notions of cultural continuity, defined as the process of maintaining and passing on traditional knowledge. They conceptualised cultural traditions as everyday practices in their lived realities, and as points of connections with the past. The creation of a women-only space for artistic practices in a resettlement context provided regular opportunities for women of different ages to discuss culturally-prescribed gender norms and traditions candidly.

This article examines service responses in Australia, exploring practitioners' accounts of adapting service delivery models in the early months of the pandemic. Data from a qualitatively enriched online survey of practitioners (n = 100) show the ways services rapidly shifted to engage with clients via remote, technology-mediated modes, as physical distancing requirements triggered rapid expansion in the use of phone, email, video calls and messaging, and many face-to-face interventions temporarily ceased. Many practitioners and service managers found that remote service delivery improved accessibility and efficiency. Others expressed concerns about their capacity to assess risk without face-to-face contact, and were unsure whether new service modalities would meet the needs of all client groups and reflect best practice. Findings attest to practitioners' mixed experiences during this period of rapid service innovation and change, and underline the importance of monitoring emerging approaches to establish which service adaptations are effective for different groups of people, and to determine good practice for combining remote and face-to-face service options in the longer term.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.02635671, 0.02754311, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00577754, 0.0, 0.01052332, 0.18344576, 0.0]",community_service,"[1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01

Whereas providing care influenced early maturity, self-efficacy, and formation of stronger bonds with care recipients, it also limited participants’ ability to find work, focus on their education, and socialise with peers. Utilisation of formal community-based and professional support services was low among the participants. Stigma associated with the label “carer”; lack of youth-friendly service settings; lack of self-identification of carer status; and a lack of cultural, age, and specific support services for different stages of caring constrained the use of support services among participants. In contrast, positive attitudes of service providers encouraged the use of support services. These findings highlight an urgent need for more professional support for young carers. • IMPLICATIONS • Failure to provide sufficient professional support to young carers can aggravate the negative consequences associated with their caring roles. • Social workers and other professionals can strengthen their collaboration with educators, work supervisors, and other support agencies to address the challenges of providing care at a young age. • Given that caring roles

The sintering behavior and expansion mechanism of Cu-Ni-Al system powder alloy were investigated. The results show that considerable expansion occurs after being sintered at 600-800°C, accompanied by the decrease of density and increase of porosity. The measurements including differential thermal analysis, EDAX analysis and metallographic observation were conducted, and it is proved that the compacts perform the larger and faster expansion after the appearance of Al-rich melt which forms by the reaction of Al with Cu and Ni at 600°C. Al-rich melt penetrates into the grain boundaries of Cu particles and leaves pores at the prior Al particle sites. Because of a large solubility of Al in the Cu and Ni, Al-rich melt is finally absorbed into the solid as a result of unbalanced diffusion between components, leading to the net mass flow between the solid/liquid interfaces, which brings about the solid particle grain growth and the increase in the volume of the specimen as a whole.","[0.01193052, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02781586, 0.0, 0.00206699, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00156862]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

The findings reveal that adhering to the gendered ‘rules in use’ in the construction industry is negatively associated with wellbeing and is usually endured in silence. We also identify the ways in which the gendered rules have different effects on the wellbeing of men and women.

With global cities such as Sydney becoming highly multi-cultural, it is vital for local governments in cities to be responsive to the diverse voices and interests of their residents. This paper investigates attitudes of people from different socio-economic backgrounds and thereby identifies barriers and opportunities for tree planting. Analysing two socio-economically diverse local government areas (LGAs) in Sydney, viz. Parramatta and North Sydney, this paper demonstrates that residents’ attitudes towards trees depends largely on tree location. Trees located on private land, are preferred for aesthetics and functionality (e.g. beauty and privacy), and trees are removed if they represent a threat to residents’ health or infrastructure. Trees located on public land are appreciated because people prefer to live along a tree-lined street where aesthetic and environmental values of trees are paramount. The above attitudes vary with income, education and dwelling type. Findings from this study suggest that local governments must engage effectively with socio-economically diverse populations and recognise different attitudes of communities in policies and practices for managing urban greenery.","[0.0341719, 0.0055531, 0.00649537, 0.0, 0.03016956, 0.00175343, 0.00292698, 0.0, 0.00933792, 0.0, 0.04864996, 0.0]",community_service,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

This study aimed to determine the impact and return on investment of the Take Kare Safe Space (TKSS) program—a harm reduction program implemented to address alcohol-related violence and disorder in three locations in Sydney’s night-time economy between 2014 and 2019. TKSS ambassadors provided support at static safe spaces and patrolled designated nightlife precincts to provide practical assistance to vulnerable and intoxicated people. Ambassadors recorded information relating to these interactions including ‘client’ age, gender, perceived level of intoxication, time and length of engagement with the program. Costs of program implementation and benefits of major incidents averted were obtained to allow calculation of return on investment. From December 2014 to April 2019, 66,455 people were supported by TKSS ambassadors. Most users were male (62%) and aged 18–25 years (66%). Of 3633 interventions by ambassadors, serious risk of harm was averted in 735 cases (20%). The program’s return on investment is estimated at 2.67, suggesting that a $1 investment results in $2.67 in benefits. Safe Spaces are extensively utilized, particularly by young males with high levels of intoxication, and represent a positive return on investment. Despite the growth of such services, there remains a notable absence of rigorous, independent evaluation regarding the outcomes and/or social benefit of safe space programs.

This paper recounts how digital storytelling was used in a mixed-methods study on settlement, to document the journeys of women who entered Australia through the Woman at Risk program in 2014–2015. Instead of merely asking a series of questions, the digital storytelling process extended our qualitative inquiry as an approach that valued the women’s own memories, interests, and hopes. The methodology represents a meaningful way of engaging in collaborative research, where participating women were not just storytellers but valued as active co-constructors of new knowledge. We outline each of three digital narratives as a ‘whole’ to consider what we can learn from a storytelling process where women with complex circumstances are privileged as protagonists-and-producers of their own stories. We argue that it is worth critically reflecting on the concepts the women propose for themselves as meaningful ways to articulate their lives, when we relinquish the researcher role as question asker to enter a space alongside participants and listen intently.

Based on the first author’s reflections on her subjective experiences as an artist representing the story of a young Somali asylum seeker woman through collaborative filmmaking, this paper aims to open up broader discussions about artists’ responsibilities to produce counter-narratives that value refugees’ perspectives and voices. By doing so, artists can avoid perpetuating existing tropes that can at times be detrimental to refugees and asylum seekers, and ensure that artists’ own agendas are secondary to what ‘protagonists’ wish to convey. We suggest five simple ways of realising this goal: genuine collaboration; informed consent; anonymity; focusing on the mundane; and (in the case of filmmaking specifically) an awareness of the editing process as a political act.","[0.02376166, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04087521, 0.0, 0.00658052, 0.0, 0.00025751, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04200997, 0.01611861]",community_service,"[9.9999900e-01 1.0000000e-06 1.4410059e-05 1.0000000e-06 1.0000000e-06

Method Demographic, legal and clinical data after referral to the NSW Mental Health Review Tribunal following an NGMI verdict for homicide matched with results from the National Homicide Monitoring Program. Results Between 1993 and 2016, a total of 2159 homicide offenders were dealt with by the NSW courts, including 169 (7.8%) who were found NGMI. Over this period, the rate of non-NGMI homicide convictions fell from 1.83 per 100,000 per annum to 0.65 per 100,000 per annum (Kendall’s tau = −0.79, p ⩽ 0.001) while the rate of NGMI homicide fluctuated, with an average annual rate of about 0.1 per 100,000 per annum (Kendall’s tau = 0.17, p = 0.23). There was no association between the annual rates of NGMI and non-NGMI homicides (Pearson r = −0.3, p = 0.16) but falling rate of non-NGMI homicide meant that the proportion of NGMI offences doubled from 5.5% in the first 12 years to 11% in the second 12 years. Nearly all (88.7%) of those found NGMI had a schizophrenia-related psychosis. However, there were high rates of psychiatric comorbidity including substance use disorder (60.7%) and a history of a prior head injury (41.1%). Most (83.4%) of the NGMI offenders had previous contact with mental health services, but only half of these had received treatment with antipsychotic medication. Conclusion The fall in conviction for homicide offences in the last 24 years has not been matched by a reduction in NGMI homicide verdicts.

Introduction The health workforce will be critical to achieving the health‐related and wider Sustainable Development Goals in the years up to 2030. Background In 2006, the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations signed a Mutual Recognition Arrangement in relation to nursing services in the region with the main aim of facilitating the mobility of nursing professionals between countries. To ensure the competency of the health workforce and the quality and safety of health services, member states are required to establish an appropriate regulatory framework. Methods This is a qualitative descriptive study. Eighteen key informant interviews were conducted in Cambodia in 2018. Walt and Gilson’s policy analysis model was applied to organize and synthesize the data. Findings Major challenges were identified such as conceptual and cultural issues, limited capacity of Cambodian stakeholders and an unstandardized system with limited coordination. Discussion In Cambodia, the nursing regulatory environment has expanded greatly over the last decade. Strategies adopted were ‘political leadership’, optimal utilization of ‘outsider’s capacity’, strengthening ‘insider’s capacity’, and ‘dedicated consultation and collaboration and consensus building’ involving all players. Implications for nursing and health policies Policymakers in similar resource‐limited countries could apply and adapt similar strategic efforts when formulating and implementing health policies, legislation and regul

Building on the line of reasoning that hedging is an outcome of regional or state-level, rather than system-level, variables, the article suggests that the room for hedging available to smaller states shrinks as great powers become more competitive and attempt to balance against one another. With an empirical focus on the post-Cold War South China Sea region, particularly the evolving behavior of the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia, the article demonstrates how, under the conditions of growing China–US competition, these regional states start moving from hedging to more pronounced bandwagoning vis-à-vis great powers regardless their domestic-level sociopolitical dispositions.

Uptake of this method remains low in Australia, although little research has been undertaken to explore this. Methods An interventional cross‐sectional study was undertaken in 2019 to explore the views and experiences of women in New South Wales. After trying the female condom, they were invited to complete an online survey and/or structured interview. Training in use of the female condom was not provided. This paper reports on qualitative findings from open‐ended survey responses and interviews. Results In total 284 participants completed the survey, and 20 participated in an interview. Most were aware of the female condom prior to participating in the study, but few had used it previously. Four broad themes were identified from the data: i) accessibility of the female condom, including cost and availability, ii) supporting choice in different circumstances, iii) aspects of empowerment and control, and iv) use of gendered language. Conclusions The female condom may be an acceptable option for many women in Australia. To support choice of method and promote uptake, it will be important to increase accessibility of the female condom by raising awareness and addressing issues of cost and availability. Further exploration of issues regarding inclusive language and messaging in health promotion campaigns and marketing is warranted to ensure this product is accessible for all people who may wish to use it, regardless of gender or sexuality. Similar research could be undertaken with men/partners and members of the LGBTQ+ community to explore their perspectives of the female condom.

A government and industry supported autonomous car service ""DRIVEN"" has been initiated in London since 2019. Another e-commerce giant, ""Alibaba"" formed a new firm, ""AutoX,"" and tested autonomous taxi services in some Shanghai city parts in China. Not only tech giants but even prominent universities are also taking part in the exciting race of human-less taxi service. An MIT based engineer brought a driverless taxi service to Singapore. Therefore, many tech giant companies and lead research universities are accelerating their pace to win the driverless taxi business's race at the background level. However, it seems the existing market dominators are ahead in the race, and as usual, they are going to grab the future driverless taxi service business. The article aims to propose a conceptual back-end operational architecture to construct a driverless taxi service. The development of driverless cars seems satisfactory, and already almost-driverless cars are available in the market (2020 Tesla Model S, 2020 Cadillac CT6, 2020 Nissan Rogue, 2020 BMW X7, 2020 Infiniti QX50, 2020 Volvo XC60, 2020 Mercedes-Benz S-Class). Therefore, an individual entrepreneur will organize his own driverless car taxi service using an operational strategy in the near future.

The extent and focus of activism and advocacy efforts varied across the three locations, with the responses advocated for shaped by local concerns and politics. In particular, activist groups diverged in their support for criminal justice responses to street harassment.

Kosovo is unique in being a post-conflict situation, in a former socialist country, with an unclear political future, under temporary UN administration. The World Health Organization (WHO) led a process of developing a health policy framework for the emergency period that included elements of health sector reform, a somewhat controversial initiative. Reform elements of the policy were consistent with normative health policies in much of eastern and central Europe. There was tension between the need to have a policy in place rapidly and the desire to be participatory. Policy to deal with emergency situations that is not available at the time required is of limited value. Although there was some tension between relief and development agendas, the policy process did direct significant resources and effort in directions that contributed to longer-term reform and development. A policy framework does not ensure compliance with policy unless issues of authority, mandate, and leadership are clear. A rapidly developed health policy framework at the onset of an emergency is desirable. Policy developers should be experienced, seen as being neutral and be relatively independent of any specific donor or interest group. WHO is well situated to play this role if it meets certain conditions.","[0.05259269, 0.00146338, 0.07915074, 0.02376431, 0.03271198, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.06689474, 0.01011061]",covid,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

Veganism is considered socially deviant from the hegemonic meat culture of the UK and so vegans often receive stigma when expressing this element of their identity. This study aimed to critically examine how vegans manage stigma dependent on the social and spatial context. Semi-structured interviews with 20 vegans in northwest England revealed that vegans employ four main strategies to manage stigma: acceptance, avoidance, reduction and denial. The chosen management technique was determined by a stigmatised individual's acceptance or rejection of public understandings of the stigma and the applicability of the stigma to the self.

The research question underpinning this study was therefore: What is the nature and extent of gender-based violence in sport in the EU? The study involved a scoping exercise that mapped existing research on the incidence and/or prevalence of any/all form(s) of GBV in sport. This was complemented by interviews with key stakeholders within each EU MS. Forty-one studies were identified across 17 countries. Of these, none investigated the whole range of behaviours that constitute GBV, so the prevalence of GBV in sport in EU MS is unknown. The most commonly studied form of GBV was sexual harassment, which had a reported prevalence rate of between 1% and 64% due to different methodologies and definitions. This variation is indicative of the challenges of studying GBV, which are discussed in this paper. Without clear prevalence rates for of (all forms of) GBV, prevention efforts cannot be efficiently targeted and the effectiveness of interventions cannot be assessed. Among others, we recommend the European Commission contract regular research in sport that uses a standardized definition of GBV and a common methodological approach.","[0.01093295, 0.0631656, 0.0, 0.00809735, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04677931, 0.0, 0.00033341, 0.01279688, 0.00496567, 0.03677691]",sexuality,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.18078759e-04

It has been argued that the variability in findings is due to effect modification by demographic characteristics that vary across samples. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the strength of the obesity-depression association is moderated by gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES). Data were from two large, school-based, studies of adolescent health and well-being (n=4320; n=1824). Students completed one of two measures of depressive symptoms (SDQ; CES-D) in school and were weighed and measured. Gender and ethnicity were self-reported and SES was indexed by residential neighbourhood characteristics or individual family deprivation. There was barely any association between obesity and depressive symptoms in either sample. There was also no evidence that obese participants who were female, white or from higher SES backgrounds were especially vulnerable to depressive symptoms. The results indicate that in community samples of adolescents, regardless of gender, SES or ethnicity, reports of depressive symptoms are not significantly higher in obese than normal-weight groups. The results are discussed in terms of obese adolescents' resilience in the face of multiple social adversities.","[0.0, 0.01410253, 0.03136097, 0.01157667, 0.0, 0.07243011, 0.09595545, 0.01188494, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01024224, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06

The aim of this paper is threefold: (1) to develop a framework for child-centred design analysis, (2) to analyse children’s designs to explore both quantitative and qualitative insights and (3) to explore how children’s voice could be elevated through design research. A Child-centred Design Analysis Framework is developed in an interdisciplinary manner, comprising four dimensions including Child, Content, Context and Format. It is used as a vehicle to analyse and code 130 ‘Dream Wheelchair’ designs by children. The children’s ‘Dream Wheelchair’ designs reference a range of features and priorities, which are gathered into themes through the framework, providing insights into children’s individual and collective mobility narratives, values and requirements. Themes are explored through a qualitative interdisciplinary lens to understand the nature of children’s lived experiences. The framework promotes child-centred framing through extracting meaning from children’s own designs. It is suggested that child-centred framing and a rights-respecting approach to assistive technology design research can lead to more appropriate design outcomes and improved user experiences for children with disabilities.","[0.00323555, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00140946, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2576743, 0.0, 0.00304721, 0.00725808, 0.008185]",child_family,"[1.70182270e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.34983164e-06 8.26993186e-05

As the same time there is concern about the harmful effects of excessive weight concerns and dietary restriction, particularly amongst young women. Many girls who control their weight experience high levels of psychological distress and a small number go on to develop eating disorders. This thesis uses data from a survey of 1177 adolescent girls, which incorporates a one- year follow-up of the sample, to examine social and psychological factors which predispose individuals to weight control attempts. It aims to distinguish aspects of weight control associated with harmful levels of distress from those which lead to healthy lifestyle changes, examining the contribution of intensity of dieting, involvement in specific weight control practices, dietary restraint and body dissatisfaction in order to investigate which are the most harmful aspects of weight control. Weight control and dietary restraint has been associated with a number of detrimental psychological and behavioural outcomes, including depression, low self esteem and bulimic binge eating. Results presented here, however, suggest that these outcomes may be more closely associated with the high levels of body dissatisfaction found in dieters, and that the direct effects of weight control behaviours may not be as strong as has been claimed. They also suggest that the sub-group of dieters who practice only healthy, recommended methods of weight control do not exhibit many of the negative psychological and behavioural characteristics of dieters.

Evidence was reviewed to investigate what self-management programmes work, why and in what circumstances. Methods A systematic review and realist synthesis were conducted. A comprehensive database search was performed on seven databases for evidence published up to July 2021. Leading candidate self-management programmes identified from the systematic review became the focus of the realist synthesis. A realist logic of analysis was applied to produce explanatory context-mechanism-outcome configurations. These explanations were consolidated into programme theories drawing on health behaviour change theory. Results By synthesising the data from eight eligible articles, programme theories articulated how three different self-management programmes work that included: (i) education and action planning, (ii) education and airway clearance techniques (ACT) and, (iii) education, exercise and ACT. Patient characteristics and collaborative partnership between healthcare professionals and patients were identified as important contexts that influenced the improvement in self-efficacy, health-related quality of life, and exercise capacity. Conclusions This review contributes to a better understanding of how the complex interaction between contexts and mechanisms can improve outcomes of clinical interest. • IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION • This evidence synthesis has identified potentially important combinations of interventions to be considered in self-management prog

Conventionally, operative repair was favoured secondary to its lower rates of re-rupture, however in more recent years, we have seen promising results and a reduction in complications with conservative management. One reason for this improvement may be due to the introduction of a functional weight-bearing orthosis, however, results for complete AT ruptures is still unclear. This study aims to evaluate the functional outcomes of early weight bearing in a functional orthosis for conservatively managed, complete AT ruptures. Methodology This study was done at East Kent Hospital University Foundation Trust in between 2019−2020. In this prospective study, we have analysed data from 41 patients with US diagnosed compete AT ruptures, with gap less than 5 cm. Every patient was treated in a functional weight-bearing orthosis (VACOped) for 8 weeks with early weight-bearing following a specific treatment protocol, followed by rehabilitation with a trained physiotherapist. All patients received a final follow-up at 1 year post injury, where we recorded the following functional outcome measurements on each leg: calf girth, single leg heel raise height, single leg heel raise repetitions and the ATRS score. Result Our study population was predominantly male with an average age of 50 (range 22−79). The majority of the cohort were physically active, with more than 75% involved in a form of sporting activity pre-injury and 15% involved in higher level activity and competitive sport.

We describe the process for ensuring adequate filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) qualitative fit testing at a local level during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Cascaded training is described, which allowed rapid spreading of the testing process, with supervision allowing quality assurance throughout. Testing consisted of subjective ‘fit checking’, checking for leaks, followed by qualitative hood testing. Results The original respirators (3M 1870) had a hood test pass rate of 87.5%. Following identification of this as a non-renewable and unsustainable option, a domestically manufactured and sustainable Help-It P2 duckbill-type respirator was adopted as the primary FFR. The hood test pass rate for this respirator was only 54%. A third respirator was made available (3M 1860), with a high pass rate of 80% but also a limited and non-renewable resource. Algorithms were constructed highlighting different proportional use of the respirators depending on the most limited resource. Conclusion The testing format used is simple, reproducible and can be used by any hospital organisation when occupational health and safety departments are unable to provide the service during overwhelming demand. Qualitative fit testing is a scalable and effective method for ensuring appropriately sized and shaped FFRs, minimising resource consumption in the process. The use of a product with appropriate filtration capacity but a lower fit test pass rate (domestic duckbill respirator) as a replaceable resource facilitated adequate respirator availability for staff that would ot

Patient disposition decisions in rural and remote emergency departments (ED) can be complex and largely dependent on the expertise and experience available to local (receiving-end) hospitals. Whilst there has been some synthesis of evidence on the effectiveness of emergency telehealth on clinical practice in the rural and remote EDs for non-acute presentations, there has been limited evaluation of the influence of contextual factors such as clinical areas and acuity of presentations on these findings. OBJECTIVE This systematic review examined the outcome measures used in studying the effectiveness of rural and remote emergency telehealth and analyzed the clinical context in which these outcome measures were used and interpreted. METHODS The search strategy used medical subject headings (MeSH) and equivalent lists of subject descriptors to find articles covering four key domains: telehealth/telemedicine, emergency department(s), effectiveness, rural and remote. According to the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome(s) of interest, and Study design (PICOS) framework, studies were selected. This search strategy was applied to MEDLINE (Ovid), Cochrane Library, Scopus, CINAHL, ProQuest, EconLit, and the CRD databases (e.g. NHS Economic Evaluation Database) for the search period of 1st January 1990 to 23rd May 2020.

Laboratory investigations of eating behavior in both humans and animals established key roles for palatability and variety in stimulating appetite, delaying satiety, and promoting excessive energy intake. There is a robust effect of food palatability and variety on short-term food intake, and increased variety and palatability also cause weight gain in animal models. However, laboratory paradigms do not replicate the complexities of eating in a natural setting, and there is a shortage of evidence to estimate the magnitude of effects on weight in humans. There are substantial individual differences in susceptibility to the palatability effect and this may be a key determinant in individual vulnerability to weight gain. The understanding of pathways through which palatability and variety can affect eating is advancing, and epidemiologic and intervention studies are needed to translate laboratory findings into applications in public health or clinical domains, and to establish whether there is a role for greater regulation of the food environment in tackling increases in obesity.","[0.0005251, 0.00510544, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05172244, 0.0, 0.20035792, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00124741]",economy,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

This included the number of attendances to the emergency department, fracture clinic, inpatient admissions and operative treatments. This was compared to a pre-COVID-19 period. We also assessed the efficacy of telephone clinics. Results There has been a noticeable decrease in the number of emergency department and fracture clinic attendances with upper limb complaints. The number of in-person fracture clinic reviews also decreased, with a reciprocal exponential increase in telephone consultations. We recorded a decrease in the number of shoulder and elbow trauma procedures performed. There was a small increase in the proportion of injuries treated conservatively during COVID-19. Our telephone clinics yielded a diagnosis and management plan in many cases and patient perspective appeared favourable. Conclusion We have noted significant change in the upper limb caseload.

As narratives around childhood, disability and mobility shift and transform, these entanglements evolve. In order to optimise the experience of childhood mobility, IPM designers must understand and respond to such changes and channel children's own requirements, desires and 'dreams' into the design process; this can be achieved by utilising a child-centred design approach. This paper identifies meaningful child-centred IPM design insights and opportunities through the interdisciplinary analysis of 130 dream wheelchair designs by disabled children, aged 4 to 17 years. A novel interdisciplinary and child-centred design analysis framework is developed to dissect, categorise and code the topics and features expressed through visuals and written descriptions in each of the children's dream wheelchair designs. Children's mobility narratives, desires and requirements are elicited and trending topics are discussed.

This study aimed to explore participants’ experiences of a brief Appetitive Trait Tailored Intervention (ATTI) based on participants’ Adult Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (AEBQ) scores. The ATTI was developed using strategies from modified Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and behaviour change techniques. Acceptability testing of the ATTI was carried out with participants (body mass index ≥25) who completed the AEBQ online and were sent their appetitive trait profile and corresponding weight loss tips via e-mail. Participants were asked to follow the tips for 8 weeks and following the tips, perceived helpfulness, barriers, and initial and final body weight. Qualitative interviews explored their experiences. Thirty-seven participants provided feedback and reported the majority of the tips to be helpful. Thirty-two participants (92.5% female) provided their final weight; 10 reported weight loss ≥5% of initial weight. Qualitative interviews (n = 21) revealed that tailoring was seen as novel and participants felt that the ATTI increased their self-awareness and encouraged behavioural changes.

Since the introduction of the TeleStroke Programme, there has been monitoring of service outputs, including regional patient access to tertiary stroke specialist advice and reperfusion treatment; however, the impact of consultation with a stroke specialist via telehealth (videoconferencing or telephone) on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of stroke care and the drivers of cost-effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. Methods and analysis The aim of the case study was to examine the impact of consultation with a stroke specialist via telehealth on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of stroke and transient ischaemic attack care using a mixed methods approach. A categorical decision tree model will be constructed in collaboration with clinicians and programme managers. A before and after comparison using state-wide administrative datasets will be used to run the base model. If sample size and statistical power permits, the cases and comparators will be matched by stroke type and presence of CT scan at the initial site of presentation, age category and presenting hospital. The drivers of cost-effectiveness will be explored through stakeholder interviews. Data from the qualitative analysis will be cross-referenced with trends emerging from the quantitative dataset and used to guide the factors to be involved in subgroup and sensitivity analysis.

There is limited quantitative research on antibiotic prescribing in Australian GP. The research question involves identifying predictors of antibiotic prescribing not in accordance with national therapeutic guidelines for urinary tract infection (UTI) in Western Australian (WA) GP. This requires large-scale, individual-level data, which is difficult to access in Australia, and in this case could not be achieved without collaboration. Findings Longitudinal records from 52 practices in WA participating in MedicineInsight were analyzed. GP datasets present challenges regarding cleaning, processing and storage. Substantial broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing was identified in initial episodes of UTI, particularly for children, and not supported by laboratory pathology. Children received broad-spectrum antibiotics 85% of the time, compared to 58% in women. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to elucidate patient- and consultation-related factors associated with antibiotic prescribing outside of the guidelines. Conclusions/Implications There is evidence of antibiotic prescribing outside of the guidelines for initial presentations of UTI in WA GP. Whilst GP datasets provide insightful information on antibiotic prescribing, it is important to explore these findings with practising clinicians to further understand the drivers behind this behaviour, and this is the next stage of this research. Key messages Collaborative partnerships can facilitate access to rich, large-scale datasets capable of answering important research questions in Australian primary care.","[0.00166836, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01876132, 0.00701704, 0.01080994, 0.06283813, 0.02799373, 0.0012918, 0.00344595, 0.03779597, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.71267579e-06 9.99999000e-01

In both cases, the exposed ice is massive or excess ice with a low lithic content. We find that erosional scarps occur between 50° and 61° north and south latitude and that they are concentrated in and near Milankovič crater in the northern hemisphere and southeast of the Hellas basin in the southern hemisphere. These may represent locations of particularly thick or clean bodies of ice. Pits created by retreat of the scarps represent sublimation‐thermokarst landforms that evolve in a manner distinct from other ice‐loss landforms on Mars. New impact craters reveal that clean subsurface ice is widespread at middle‐ and high‐latitudes in both hemispheres at depths less than 1 m. Both the depth to ice and the ice content appear to exhibit significant variability over tens to hundreds of meters. The lowest‐latitude exposed ice is near 39°N and is at the edge of a region where impact exposures between 40° and 50°N are common, consistent with other indications of a high ice content.

Objective: Determine associations between continuity and regularity of primary care and statin use amongst individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. Design: Observational cohort study using self-report and administrative data from 267,153 participants of the Sax Institute's 45 and Up Study conducted in New South Wales, Australia. from 2006 to 2009. Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) data, from Services Australia, were linked to survey, hospital and death data by the NSW Centre for Health Record Linkage. Participants: The 45 and Up Study participants at risk of CVD outcomes based on self-report and administrative data, divided into existing users and potential users based on dispensing records through the exposure period. Main measures: The Continuity of Care index (COC), measuring whether patients see the same GP, and an index assessing whether GP visits are on a regular basis, measured from July 2011 to June 2012.

Therefore, it is paramount to identify the views of the community regarding how to allocate such resources. This study aims to quantify Australian community preferences for ventilation allocation. Methods: A discrete choice experiment was designed and administrated to an adult Australian online panel. Each survey respondent answered 12 choice sets from a total design of 120. Each choice set placed the respondent in the role of hypothetical decision maker, prioritising care between two patients. Conditional logit, mixed logit regression and latent class analysis were used to analyse the data. Additionally, we asked a series of attitudinal questions about different methods of making such decisions in practice, focusing on who should be responsible. Results: A total of 1050 community members completed the survey and responded to each choice. Dimensions considered most important were age, likely effectiveness, smoking status, whether the person has dependents, whether they are a healthcare worker, and whether they have a disability or not. Estimating marginal rates of substitution between patient characteristics and chance of survival if ventilated yielded values of up to 30 percentage points if the patient was 70 years old relative to being 30. However, respondents typically said they would prefer such decisions to be made by medical professionals. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the preferences of the community to allocation of ventilators during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Visual Cues Given by Humans Are Not Sufficient for Asian Elephants (Elephas maximus) to Find Hidden Food,"['Joshua M Plotnik', 'Jen Pokorny', 'Titiporn Keratimanochaya[...]', 'David Getz']",recent suggests domesticated specie due artificial selection human specific preferred behavioral trait better wild animal responding visual cue given human location hidden food although seems supported study range domesticated including dog goat horse wild including wolf chimpanzee animal evidence exposure human positively influence ability wild domesticated animal follow cue test performance asian elephant elephas maximus object choice task provides visual cue given human location hidden food captive elephant interesting candidate investigating domestication human exposure may impact cue following represent non domesticated specie almost constant human interaction group elephant n study unable follow pointing body orientation combination honest signal food location however able follow vocal command already familiar novel context suggesting elephant able follow cue sufficiently salient although elephant inability follow visual cue provides partial support domestication hypothesis alternative explanation elephant may rely heavily sensory modality specifically olfaction audition needed rule alternative explanation,Article,3.0,411,,1,1,23,12.0,144,"Recent research suggests that domesticated species - due to artificial selection by humans for specific, preferred behavioral traits - are better than wild animals at responding to visual cues given by humans about the location of hidden food. \Although this seems to be supported by studies on a range of domesticated (including dogs, goats and horses) and wild (including wolves and chimpanzees) animals, there is also evidence that exposure to humans positively influences the ability of both wild and domesticated animals to follow these same cues. Here, we test the performance of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) on an object choice task that provides them with visual-only cues given by humans about the location of hidden food. Captive elephants are interesting candidates for investigating how both domestication and human exposure may impact cue-following as they represent a non-domesticated species with almost constant human interaction. As a group, the elephants (n = 7) in our study were unable to follow pointing, body orientation or a combination of both as honest signals of food location. They were, however, able to follow vocal commands with which they were already familiar in a novel context, suggesting the elephants are able to follow cues if they are sufficiently salient. Although the elephants' inability to follow the visual cues provides partial support for the domestication hypothesis, an alternative explanation is that elephants may rely more heavily on other sensory modalities, specifically olfaction and audition. Further research will be needed to rule out this alternative explanation.","[0.00962859, 0.00480846, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00311718, 0.0310487, 0.0, 0.09251137, 0.00059564, 0.0, 0.01429645]",economy,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Here we show through parallel clinical and integrative preclinical studies the significance of the protease cathepsin-L on cardiac function during reperfusion injury. Methods and Results We found that direct cardiac release of cathepsin-L in STEMI patients (n = 76) immediately post-PPCI leads to elevated serum cathepsin-L levels and that serum levels of cathepsin-L in the first 24 hour post-reperfusion are associated with reduced cardiac contractile function and increased infarct size. Preclinical studies, demonstrate that inhibition of cathepsin-L release following reperfusion injury with CAA0225 reduces infarct size and improves cardiac contractile function by limiting abnormal cardiomyocyte calcium handling and apoptosis. Conclusion Our findings suggest that cathepsin-L is a novel therapeutic target that could be exploited clinically to counteract the deleterious effects of acute reperfusion injury after an acute STEMI. Translational perspective New therapeutic targets are urgently required to limit myocardial damage after reperfusion injury. We identified cardiac release of the protease cathepsin-L among patients following primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). Elevated serum levels of cathepsin-L were associated with reduced contractile function and increased infarct size at 24 hour and 6 months post-PPCI.

There has been relatively little academic attention directed towards the Act, so the question of why and how this flagship legislation generated such intense opposition that it was repealed within six years of its introduction demands investigation. This paper explores the implementation of the Act from the perspectives of football fans, criminal justice agencies, and representatives of football clubs, with a specific focus on the impact of police surveillance practices. The research uncovered strong perceptions that such practices were considered intimidatory, which may have weakened the perceived legitimacy of the Act. This paper poses a challenge to simple readings of evidence in terms of the claimed benefits of particular forms of surveillance, arguing that the use of technologies such as powerful hand-held cameras and body worn video (BWV) has had a detrimental impact on police-fan relationships, interactions and dialogue.","[0.00624719, 0.0, 0.00162671, 0.0, 0.02559793, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.13943704, 0.00489623, 0.09206195]",criminology,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01

This provides opportunities to observe changes in sports bettors’ behaviour when their primary form of activity is removed and assess the impact of Covid-19 related circumstances upon gambling. Methods In July 2020, we conducted an online cross-sectional survey of people who bet regularly (at least monthly) on sports before Covid-19 (n=3866). Bi-variate analyses compared changes in gambling behaviours before and during the initial lockdown. Multi-variate logistic regression models explored associations between problem gambling (men) and moderate risk or problem gambling (MRPG) (women) with changes in Covid-19 related circumstances and changing gambling behaviours during Britain’s initial ‘lockdown’ (March-June 2020). Results 29.8% of male sports bettors and 33.4% of female sports bettors stopped gambling altogether during the initial Covid-19 lockdown, though 17.3% of men and 16.5% of women started a new form of gambling during lockdown. Among men, adjusted odds ratios of problem gambling were higher among those starting a new gambling activity during lockdown (OR=2.50 [95% CI 1.38-4.53]). Among women, adjusted odds ratios of MRPG were higher among those whose frequency of gambling on any activity increased during lockdown (OR=4.21 [1.99-8.92] and among those shielding for health reasons.

Britain has one of the world’s most liberal gambling markets, meaning that the regulatory changes there have implications for developments elsewhere. A review of the British Gambling Act 2005 is underway. This has generated a range of actions by the industry, including mobilising arguments around the threat of the “black market”. We critically explore industry’s framing of these issues as part of their strategy to resist regulatory change during the Gambling Act review. We used a predefined review protocol to explore industry narratives about the “black market” in media reports published between 8 December 2020 and 26 May 2021. Fifty-five articles were identified and reviewed, and themes were narratively synthesised to examine industry framing of the “black market”. The black market was framed in terms of economic threat and loss, and a direct connection was made between its growth and increased regulation. The articles mainly presented gambling industry perspectives uncritically, citing industry-generated evidence (n = 40). Industry narratives around the “black market” speak to economically and emotionally salient concerns: fear, safety, consumer freedom and economic growth. This dominant framing in political, mainstream and industry media may influence political and public opinion to support the current status quo: “protecting” the existing regulated market rather than “protecting” people. Debates should be reframed to consider all policy options, especially those designed to protect public health.","[0.04021581, 0.00263457, 0.04319195, 0.02044613, 0.00819386, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00728685, 0.01783385, 0.00721034, 0.01418004]",covid,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

TARGET-FFR is an investigator-initiated, single-centre, randomized controlled trial to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a post-PCI FFR-guided optimization strategy vs. standard coronary angiography in achieving final post-PCI FFR values ≥0.90. Methods and results : After angiographically guided PCI, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive a physiology-guided incremental optimization strategy (PIOS) or a blinded coronary physiology assessment (control group). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a final post-PCI FFR ≥0.90. Final FFR ≤0.80 was a prioritized secondary outcome. A total of 260 patients were randomized (131 to PIOS, 129 to control) and 68.1% of patients had an initial post-PCI FFR <0.90.

Thus, it is critical to identify predictive biomarkers to enhance patient selection for NAC. Here we report a radiomic model for pre-therapeutic prediction of breast cancers insensitive to NAC. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 125 breast cancer patients (63 in the primary cohort and 62 in the validation cohort) who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (imaging sequence: diffusion-weighted, T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted) before receiving NAC. All patients received surgical resection, and Miller-Payne grading system were applied to assess the response to NAC. Grade 1-2 cases were classified as insensitive to NAC. We extracted 1941 radiomic features in the primary cohort. After feature selection, the optimal feature set was used to construct a radiomic signature using machine learning. We built a combined prediction model incorporating the radiomic signature and independent clinical risk factors using multivariable logistic regression. The performance of the combined model was assessed in the validation cohort. Results: The radiomic signature consisting 4 features showed good performance for identifying Grade 1-2 group, yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 (95% confidence interval: 0.647–1) in the validation cohort.

Experimental design: A total of 586 potentially eligible patients were retrospectively enrolled from four hospitals (primary cohort and external validation cohort 1-3). Quantitative imaging features were extracted from T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging before NAC for each patient. With features selected using a coarse to fine feature selection strategy, four radiomic signatures were constructed based on each of the three MRI sequences and their combination. RMM was developed based on the best radiomic signature incorporating with independent clinicopathologic risk factors. The performance of RMM was assessed with respect to its discrimination and clinical usefulness, and compared with that of clinical information-based prediction model. Results: Radiomic signature combining multiparametric MRI achieved an AUC of 0.79 (the highest among the four radiomic signatures). The signature further achieved good performances in hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative group and triple-negative group. RMM yielded an AUC of 0.86, which was significantly higher than that of clinical model in two of the three external validation cohorts. Conclusions: The study suggested a possibility that RMM provided a potential tool to develop a model for predicting pCR to NAC in breast cancer.","[0.00220506, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.11587708, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0050459, 0.00243607]",health_medicine,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

Drawing on extensive qualitative research with East European migrants in Scotland, we explore empirically the material, relational and temporal aspects of experiences of settlement at the neighbourhood level. We consider the ways in which migrants encounter and assess the material and institutional realities of their neighbourhoods. We examine the social relationships which develop in place, paying attention to social and cultural distancing and mutual ‘othering’, which may run counter to the development of place-based bonds. We discuss the role of time and the processual and ambiguous nature of settlement. Importantly, in our analysis, we consider the possibility that theoretical frameworks developed specifically for understanding migrant experiences might overemphasise their uniqueness and risk overlooking similarities grounded in multi-scalar hierarchies of power, which cut across lines of ethnic or cultural difference. We draw on wider theories and studies of place-attachment, as well as migration studies theories of embedding and emplacement, to explore the ways in which our participants’ experiences may be understood as both similar to and different from more widely shared realities of life in deprived areas.","[0.04241281, 0.01402493, 0.0, 0.00320855, 0.0, 0.00930249, 0.01361537, 0.01589446, 0.0, 0.00052532, 0.01272444, 0.19037788]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 5.27789398e-05

However, their function and expression profile in the HFs cycle of yak are yet unknown. Only a few functional lncRNAs have been identified, partly due to the low sequence conservation and lack of identified conserved properties in lncRNAs. Here, lncRNA-seq was employed to detect the expression profile of lncRNAs during the HFs cycle of yak, and the sequence conservation of two datasets between yak and cashmere goat during the HFs cycle was analyzed. Results: A total of 2884 lncRNAs were identified in 5 phases (Jan., Mar., Jun., Aug., and Oct.) during the HFs cycle of yak. Then, differential expression analysis between 3 phases (Jan., Mar., and Oct.) was performed, revealing that 198 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) were obtained in the Oct.-vs-Jan. group, 280 DELs were obtained in the Jan.-vs-Mar. group, and 340 DELs were obtained in the Mar.-vs-Oct. group. Subsequently, the nearest genes of lncRNAs were searched as the potential target genes and used to explore the function of DELs by GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. Several critical pathways involved in HFs development such as Wnt signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, and signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells, were enriched. To further screen key lncRNAs influencing the HFs cycle, 24 DELs with differ degree of sequence conservation were obtained via a comparative analysis of partial DELs with previously published lncRNA-seq data of cashmere goat in the HFs cycle using NCBI BLAST-2.9.0+, and 3 DELs of them were randomly selected for further detailed a

We suggest that methods teaching suffers from an unhealthy disassociation between research in theory – which we call ‘method acting’ – and research in practice.

The age of information (AoI) is adopted to capture the timeliness of the status updates. Two Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) schemes, namely, classical HARQ scheme and incremental redundancy HARQ (IR-HARQ) scheme, are taken into consideration to combat the errors occurred in the transmission. In this setting, once an update is not decoded successfully, one should carefully decide how to schedule the updates for optimizing the AoI. Especially, differential encoding scheme is introduced in the considered system to exploit the temporal correlations of the source. By differential encoding, each update can be actual or differential, based on the differential encoding level. To minimize the long-term average age, we formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and prove that the optimal transmission policies for classical HARQ scheme and IR-HARQ scheme behave differently in threshold structures. Further, we jointly optimize the codeword length, differential encoding level and retransmission times to minimize the AoI. The performance comparison shows the advantages of IR-HARQ scheme over classical HARQ scheme from the age perspective.","[0.0147419325, 0.0, 0.0, 0.000364406244, 0.0, 0.0, 0.03815474, 0.0, 4.16888549e-05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.000171275701]",health_medicine,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01

Presently, the efficacy of drug treatments for diabetic retinopathy (DR) is not satisfactory, thus urgently necessitating effective drug treatment measures. TangWang prescription (TWP) has been found to have retinal protection effects in previous clinical and basic research. However, there is a lack of rigorous, randomized, and controlled studies. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TWP in delaying the development of DR. Methods: This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial, consisting of 384 participants to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio in the treatment and control groups. Furthermore, the treatment and control groups will be administered the TangWang prescription and the placebo, respectively, each at a dose of one bag twice a day. The study period will last for 48 weeks. The primary outcome measure will be the changes in the degree of retinal microvascular lesions before and after treatment. The secondary outcome will be changes in the degree of hemangioma, microvascular bleeding, microvascular leakage, macular edema, and vision. All statistical tests will be two-sided, and a p < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Discussion: We hypothesize that the patients with DR will benefit from TangWang prescription, and in addition to the central random system and platform of dynamic information collection, the patients’ conditions will be monitored, and the data collected for analysis.

Modeling these systems with sufficient accuracy for LISA science requires going to second (or postadiabatic) order in gravitational self-force theory. Here we present a practical two-timescale framework for achieving this and generating postadiabatic waveforms. The framework comprises a set of frequency-domain field equations that apply on the fast, orbital timescale, together with a set of ordinary differential equations that determine the evolution on the slow, inspiral timescale. Our analysis is restricted to the special case of quasicircular orbits around a Schwarzschild black hole, but its general structure carries over to the realistic case of generic (inclined and eccentric) orbits in Kerr spacetime. In our restricted context, we also develop a tool that will be useful in all cases: a formulation of the frequency-domain field equations using hyperboloidal slicing, which significantly improves the behavior of the sources near the boundaries. We give special attention to the slow evolution of the central black hole, examining its impact on both the two-timescale evolution and the earlier self-consistent evolution scheme.","[0.03089107, 0.00310935, 0.00133922, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.03375344, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00190317, 0.0, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

Over the next century further excavations and research on the Sussex mines contributed to the narrative of the Neolithic period in southern England. The Early Neolithic flint mines of Sussex remain one of the earliest forms of large-scale monument to be constructed in the British Isles and their products, mostly finely made bifacial axes, were widely distributed across the region. Numerous flint mines are also found across Northwest Europe, including extensive complexes in Belgium, France, Poland and the Netherlands, and the act of extracting flint from deep workings remains a defining element of the Neolithic. Research on the English flint mines has diminished in recent decades, with no new fieldwork carried out for over 30 years, in contrast to Continental Europe where numerous sites are still under excavation. This thesis combines archival research and reassessment of previous research with new fieldwork, radiocarbon dates and other data to question longstanding interpretations of the Sussex mines. It is proposed that flint mines were pivotal monuments to the creation, development and spread of nascent Early Neolithic practices and cultural identities from the very start of the period in southern England.

The industry effect is significant in the services sector. The results also show that the impact of firm-specific characteristics and industry differs across the sub-components of FP and manufacturing and service industries.

Then, the White Paper of China's Arctic Policy was officially published in January 2018. It proposes the joint construction of the PSR to promote sustainable economic and social development in the Arctic region. Notably, the PSR aims to open up China's maritime trade route through the Arctic to Northwest Europe and influence the container hinterland pattern of China's coastal ports. This study assumes three scenarios to analyse and predict the evolution of the hinterlands of Chinese ports exporting to Europe under the PSR. The discrete selection model based on random utility is constructed to divide the dominant hinterland, probabilistic hinterland and major competitive hinterland of ports. The research shows that the cost and time, container throughput and risk have negative effects on a shipper's choice of port, whereas the sailing frequency has a positive effect.

Many edge centrality metrics have been proposed, but the crucial issue that how good the discriminating power of a metric is, with respect to other measures, is still open. In this paper, we address the question about the benchmark of the discriminating power of edge centrality metrics. We first use the automorphism concept to define equivalent edges, based on which we introduce a benchmark for the discriminating power of edge centrality measures and develop a fast approach to compare the discriminating power of different measures. According to the benchmark, for a desirable measure, equivalent edges have identical metric scores, while inequivalent edges possess different scores. However, we show that even in a toy graph, inequivalent edges cannot be discriminated by three existing edge centrality metrics. We then present a novel edge centrality metric called forest centrality (FC). Extensive experiments on real-world networks and model networks indicate that FC has better discriminating power than three existing edge centrality metrics.","[0.0292033, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02450948, 0.0, 0.00184758, 0.00170625, 0.0, 0.0]",politics,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Methods: The present study included participants who participated in the baseline survey of China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) and excluded participants who were lost to follow up or died before 2009, leaving a total of 506 004 participants. Negative binomial regression models were used to analyze the epidemiological distribution of any fracture and fracture at five specific body sites (upperlimb, lowerlimb, spine, pelvis and hip) from 2009 to 2016 in 10 regions. Results: During a median follow-up of (7.7±1.2) years (total person-years 3 899 814), we documented 17 118 cases of fracture hospitalizations. The crude fracture hospitalization rate was 4.39/1 000 person-years. After controlling for the increasing age of the fixed cohort, the hospitalization rates of fractures at various body sites increased from 2009 to 2016, with an annual growth rate (95%CI) of 9.1% (8.3%-9.9%) for any fracture. The fracture hospitalization rate was higher in rural than in urban areas except for hip fractures (P<0.05) and the hospitalization rate of any fracture were 5.42/1 000 and 3.24/1 000 person-years in rural and urban areas, respectively. Fracture hospitalization rate increased by age. In participants aged <50 years, men had higher fracture hospitalization rates than women except for pelvis fracture, while in those aged ≥50 years, women had higher fracture hospitalization rates than men. Conclusions: Fracture hospitalization rates increased by age and also showed upward selular trends. As China has begun the aging process, fractures impose a heavier burden on society.

However, this transform suffers from a relatively poor resolution in the high fractional frequency region, which results in difficulties in discriminating signals containing close high fractional frequency components. A simple but effective method to overcome this deficiency is the fractional wavelet packet transform (FRWPT). There exist several different definitions of the FRWPT in the literature. Unfortunately, these existing definitions do not generalize well the classical results for the conventional wavelet packet transform. The objective of this paper is to obtain a novel FRWPT that preserves the properties of its conventional counterpart. We first define the novel FRWPT and then discuss its related properties. Fractional wavelet packet subspaces are also constructed. Moreover, a recursive algorithm for implementing the proposed FRWPT is presented.

Increasing evidence shows that Verapamil is able to enhance the cytotoxic effect of certain chemotherapies and reverse multidrug resistance by competitively inhibiting drug transport through P-glycoprotein. The side population (SP) is a small subtype of tumor cells with stem-like properties which could substantially be blocked by verapamil. In this study, we focus on the therapeutic potential of verapamil on stem-like SP cells and its positive effect as a chemotherapy promoter in pancreatic cancer. Material and methods: From the highly metastatic pancreatic cancer cell line L3.6pl a gemcitabine resistant variant (L3.6plGem) was developed and further validated by IC-50 determination. Hoechst33342 staining was used to detect the SP proportion in both sensitive and resistant L3.6pl cells. Proliferation assays, clonogenic assays, migration assays and apoptosis assays were performed in the presence of verapamil alone and combined with gemcitabine treatment. SP cells sorted from L3.6plGem were implanted orthotopically in nude mice and treated with verapamil by daily i.p injections. Results: After continuous treatment with gemcitabine, the IC50 of L3.6plGem significantly increased from 6.11ng/ml±0.93 to 119.77ng/ml±5.12 (p<1E-9). In parallel, the percentage of SP cells rose from 0.9%±0.22 to 5.38%±0.99 (p<5E-17).

While Hilbert spaces with higher dimensionality, e.g., spatial modes of light, allow higher information capacity per photon, such spatial mode entanglement transport requires custom multimode fiber and is limited by decoherence-induced mode coupling. Here, we circumvent this by transporting multidimensional entangled states down conventional single-mode fiber (SMF). By entangling the spin-orbit degrees of freedom of a biphoton pair, passing the polarization (spin) photon down the SMF while accessing multiple orbital angular momentum (orbital) subspaces with the other, we realize multidimensional entanglement transport.

Herein, M1 macrophages engineered with up-regulated CCR2 expression are employed as Fe3O4 nanoparticles carrier. Modified macrophages are further extruded into exosome-mimic nanovesicles (denoted as CCR2(+)-Fe-M1-Nvs) for preferential delivery. Compared with M1-derived exosomes, CCR2(+)-Fe-M1-Nvs exhibit favorable modification and production efficiency, and can be obtained in large quantity. Moreover, correlative in vivo and in vitro measurements find that CCR2(+)-Fe-M1-Nvs are recruited in the metastatic lesion through CCR2-CCL2 axis which is analogous to mature macrophages.

In this study, we observed Gal-1 expression was upregulated and positively associated with metastasis and EMT markers in 162 human gastric cancer tissue specimens. In vitro studies showed Gal-1 induced invasion, the EMT phenotype and activated the non-canonical hedgehog (Hh) pathway in gastric cancer cell lines. Furthermore, our data revealed that Gal-1 modulated the non-canonical Hh pathway by increasing the transcription of glioma-associated oncogene-1 (Gli-1) via a Smoothened (SMO)-independent manner, and that upregulation of Gal-1 was strongly associated with gastric cancer metastasis.

It is unclear whether intercostal analgesia is as useful in the prevention of postoperative chronic pain as it is for acute pain for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of perioperative intercostal analgesia for chronic pain via a multimodal analgesic regimen for VATS during 6 months of postoperative follow-up. Methods: We identified 837 cases of VATS from August 2016 to August 2018. Patients were treated by perioperative intercostal analgesia with 0.75% ropivacaine 50 mg through the intercostal catheter every 8 hours until chest tube extubation (INA group) or conventional analgesia with preoperative 0.75% ropivacaine 50 mg at incision once (CON group). Numerical rating scale (NRS) and neuropathic pain were evaluated in 6 months of post-surgery follow-up. Postoperative adverse effects were recorded. Results: In total, there were 419 patients in INA group and 418 patients in CON group. Scores of NRS with motion was lower in INA group at 3 postoperative days (P = 0.032).

The enzymatic production of isoquercitrin from rutin catalyzed by hesperidinase is feasible; however, the bioprocess is hindered by low substrate concentration and a long reaction time. Thus, a novel biphase system consisting of [Bmim][BF4]:glycine-sodium hydroxide (pH 9) (10:90, v/v) and glyceryl triacetate (1:1, v/v) was initially established for isoquercitrin production. The biotransformation product was identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the bonding mechanism of the enzyme and substrate was inferred using circular dichroism spectra and kinetic parameters. The highest rutin conversion of 99.5% and isoquercitrin yield of 93.9% were obtained after 3 h. The reaction route is environmentally benign and mild, and the biphase system could be reused. The substrate concentration was increased 2.6-fold, the reaction time was reduced to three tenths the original time. The three-dimensional structure of hesperidinase was changed in the biphase system, which α-helix and random content were reduced and β-sheet content was increased.

Methods: We constructed the lung cancer polygenic genetic risk score (PRS-19) based on the 19 previously published genetic variations, using 100 615 participants with genotyping data from the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB). Using the 5-year absolute risk of lung cancer in a population (55 years old with at least 30-pack-year history of smoking) as reference, the trend of 5-year absolute risk in different genetic risk groups was calculated in smokers and non-smokers, respectively. Distribution curves of 5-year absolute risk were also described to determine the theoretical age or smoking dose when different genetic risk groups reached the reference values. Given the overall findings, the specific start age for lung cancer screening were suggested for different genetic risk groups. Results: The 5-year absolute risk of lung cancer was 0.67% in 55-year-old smokers with 30 packs per year in the CKB. Among smokers, 5-year absolute risk of participants increased as the genetic risk increased. Hence, it was recommended that people at high genetic risk should start screening earlier. For the highest genetic risk populations (the top 1% of PRS), the start age might be changed to 50 years old. If the start age remained at 55-year-old, the smoking dose should be set lowered in high genetic risk populations. For the highest genetic risk populations, they should be included in lung cancer screening regardless of the cumulative smoking exposure. Among nonsmokers, it was also valuable to screen people with high genetic risk, considering the start age of 62 for the highest genetic risk populatio

Methods: Data of 23 615 participants from the second resurvey of the China Kadoore Biobank (CKB) was used. Fried phenotype was constructed using five phenotypes, and frailty indexes (FI) were constructed using 28 and 40 deficits, respectively. We calculated the Weighted Kappa coefficient to compare the consistency of three measures in the classification of frailty status. Cox regression was performed to analyze the association of frailty status with risk of mortality. Results: The frailty prevalence calculated by Fried phenotype, FI-28, and FI-40 were 5.4%, 7.9%, and 4.0%, respectively. The Kappa coefficients of Fried phenotype with FI-28 and FI-40 were 0.357 and 0.408, respectively. The Kappa coefficients of FI-28 and FI-40 was 0.712. During an average of (3.9±0.5) years of follow-up, 755 participants died. When Fried phenotype was used, compared with the robust participants, the prefrail and frail participants had increased risk of mortality, the multivariable-adjusted HRs were 1.60 (95%CI: 1.32-1.94) and 2.90 (95%CI: 2.25-3.73), respectively.

A few studies demonstrate that Nrf2 regulates hepatocyte proliferation during liver regeneration. The aim of the study was to gain insight into how Nrf2 modulates the cell cycle of replicating hepatocytes in regenerating livers. Wild-type and Nrf2-null mice were subjected to 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PH) and sacrificed at multiple time points for various analyses. Nrf2-null mice exhibited sluggish liver regrowth, although the lost liver mass was eventually restored seven days after PH. Nrf2 deficiency did not affect the number of hepatocytes entering the cell cycle, but rather caused a delay in hepatocyte mitosis. Mechanistically, the lack of Nrf2 resulted in increased mRNA and protein levels of hepatic Cyclin A2 when remaining hepatocytes were replicating in response to PH. Moreover, in regenerating livers, Nrf2 deficiency caused dysregulation of Wee1, Cdc2, and Cyclin B1 in their mRNA and protein expression, leading to decreased activity of Cdc2. Nrf2 is required for timely M phase entry of replicating hepatocytes by ensuring proper regulation of Cyclin A2 and the Wee1/Cdc2/Cyclin B1 pathway during live regeneration.

The reasons why computerisation might increase a firm’s income but reduce the share assigned to wages are still not well understood. The uniquely rich Workplace Employment Relations Survey (WERS) 2004–2011 includes firm-level measures of the main production inputs and outputs, and thus allows an analysis of the main mechanisms through which increased computer usage influenced the wage share of income in UK workplaces over this period. This analysis shows that the proportion of employees using computers impacted the wage share in ways that were at odds with two mainstream views: that computers complement capital, and that labour can be easily replaced by capital. The results show that the proportion of employees using computers reduced the wage share by disproportionally increasing the productivity of the least skilled employees, who were not proportionally compensated for their increase in productivity. The stability of the wage share, over the period of interest, is explained by the rise in a workplace’s share of professional employees and by a rise in work effort. This positive contribution to the wage share was counteracted by an increased share of employees using computers and by a reduction in the share of employees whose pay was negotiated by unions, thereby contributing to a decline in the wage share of firm income.

Presently, CPI measures are not produced for regions within the UK. It is believed that, using only available data sources, a regional CPI would not be precise or reliable enough as an official statistic, primarily because the regional partitioning of the data makes sample sizes too small. We investigate this claim by producing experimental regional CPIs using publicly available price data, and deriving expenditure weights from the Living Costs and Food survey. We detail the methods and challenges of developing a regional CPI and evaluate its reliability. We then assess whether model-based methods such as smoothing and small area estimation significantly improve the measures. We find that a regional CPI can be produced with available data sources, however it appears to be excessively volatile over time, mainly due to the weights. Smoothing and small area estimation improve the reliability of the regional CPI series to some extent but they remain too volatile for regional policy use. This research provides a valuable framework for the development of a more viable regional CPI measure for the UK in the future.","[0.01691749, 0.0, 0.00492607, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04773542, 0.0, 0.04663316, 0.00092572, 0.00205708, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Gene expression analysis showed a significant difference in the expression of more than 1,300 genes in SP cells, among which a highly significant difference in microRNA expression of miR-21 and miR-221 between SP and NSP cells was identified. SP cells were identified and characterized by flow cytometry using Hoechst 33342 dye staining from a highly metastatic human pancreatic cancer cell line (L3.6pl). Antagomir transfection was performed using miRNA-21 and miRNA-221 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and followed by detection of cell apoptosis, cell cycle progression, chemosensitivity, and invasion. Sorted SP cells from gemcitabine-resistant L3.6pl cells (L3.6plGres-SP) cells were orthotopically implanted in nude mice with or without miRNA-21 and miRNA-221 ASOs mono- and combination therapy. The administration of antagomir-21 and antagomir-221 significantly reduced the SP cell fraction, decreased SP cell differentiation, and downstream gene regulation, and thereby induced reduction of L3.6pl cell proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance against gemcitabine and 5-Fluorouracil. Combination of ASOs therapy against miRNA-21 and miRNA-221 significantly inhibited primary tumor growth and metastasis compared to single antagomir treatment, especially, in L3.6plGres-SP-induced pancreatic tumor growth in vivo.

However, organisms given this species designation are extremely diverse, genetically and phenotypically. E. coli proves to be a valuable model system for understanding bacterial physiology, metabolism, genetics and pathogenesis. Why has E. coli been so much more extensively studied than any other bacterium on Earth? It all began with the German pediatrician and bacteriologist, Theodor Escherich, who was dismayed to find that so many babies were dying of diarrhea diseases. In fact, we now know that E. coli is one of the top causes of infant mortality, adult diarrhea and urinary tract infections worldwide. It was because of the organism's broad host specificity and ability to cause many different diseases in large numbers of animals, including humans, that it was first selected as an important bacterium for study. More recently, it has been found that certain strains of E. coli are probiotic, having beneficial effects on host animals, counteracting the detrimental consequences of their pathogenic counterparts. Genetic analyses have revealed that the tremendous phenotypic diversity of the hundreds of currently recognized E. coli strains resulted from the frequent occurrence of horizontal gene transfer during the evolutionary divergence of the Escherichia genus. In fact, the pan genome of E. coli far exceeds the core genome, by up to 20-fold or more. Thus E. coli should not be thought of as an entity or species; it represents an entire spectrum of related organisms sharing only the core housekeeping genes.","[0.01223295, 0.00011472, 0.00230472, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0478129, 0.0, 0.00381967, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00972133]",health_medicine,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

The research of the adaptability of yak against hypoxia is of great significance to identify the genetic characteristics and yak breeding.Methods Based on the transcriptome sequencing data (PRJNA362606), the R package DESeq2 and WGCNA were conducted to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and construct the gene co-expression network. The module hub genes were identified and characterized by the correlation of gene and trait, module membership (kME). In addition, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were used to explore the functions of hub genes.ResultsOur results revealed that 1098, 1429, and 1645 DEGs were identified in muscle, spleen, and lung, respectively. Besides, a total of 13 gene co-expression modules were detected, of which two hypoxic adaptation-related modules (saddlebrown and turquoise) were found. We identified 39 and 150 hub genes in these two modules. Functional enrichment analyses showed that 12 GO terms and 18 KEGG pathways were enriched in the saddlebrown module while 85 GO terms and 22 KEGG pathways were enriched in the turquoise module. The significant pathways related to hypoxia adaptation include FoxO signaling pathway, Thermogenesis pathway, and Retrograde endocannabinoid signaling pathway, etc.Conclusions In this s

Significant differences in LAPW RF auto‐annotation occurred according to RMA setting, with curves displaying catheter position, CF and impedance data indicating “best‐fit” for catheter motion detection using RMA “off”. Comparing RMA “on” versus “off”, respectively: Total annotated sites 82 versus 98; median RF duration per‐site 13.3s versus 10.6s (p<0.0001); median force time integral 177g.s versus 130g.s (p=0.0002); mean inter‐tag distance (ITD) 6.0mm versus 4.8mm (p=0.002).

Proper vehicle coordination and motion plan at road intersections are of importance to guarantee safety as well as improving the traffic throughput, fuel efficiency and so on. In this paper, we try to present a general dedicated intersection coordination framework for autonomous vehicles, where both high- and low-level planners are appropriately designed and integrated. In the high-level planner, two different strategies are formulated to coordinate the autonomous vehicles to generate reference trajectories and feasible ""tunnels"", respectively. Especially, a novel space-time-block based resource allocation scheme is presented to describe the feasible tunnels. Furthermore, to avoid collisions with unexpected obstacles such as pedestrians, bicycles or other vehicles with human drivers, a low-level planner is designed to generate practical trajectories based on the solutions from the high-level planner, according to their local on-board observations. Simulations and practical experiments are carried out, to show that our proposed coordination framework can achieve obvious performance advantages in various traffic metrics, including the throughput, fairness in driving maneuvers and driving comfort, etc. We also find that the high-level planner is effective in eliminating possible deadlocks among autonomous vehicles, which is rarely discussed in existing investigations.","[0.01538712, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00216165, 0.08344485, 0.0, 0.00718975, 0.00228349, 0.0, 0.01805024]",health_medicine,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01

Results: Following the standardization of the 2010 China national population, the prevalence rate of passive smoking was 56.7%, and the prevalence rate of living with smokers was 66.5% among the Chinese adults. Both of the aforementioned rates were higher in rural than in urban areas.

The growing demand for onsite detection still faces challenges for sensitive and easy-to-use methods. In this work, a novel surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor based on GR-5 DNAzyme and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was developed. Thiolated DNAzyme was immobilized on the gold surface of the sensor chip followed by anchoring the substrate-functionalized AuNPs through the DNAzyme-substrate hybridization. The coupling between the localized surface plasmon (LSP) of AuNPs and the surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) on the gold sensor surface was used to improve the sensitivity. The substrate cleavage in the presence of Pb2+ ions was catalyzed by DNAzyme, leading to the removal of AuNPs and the diminished LSP-SPP coupling. The optimal detection limit was 80 pM for the sensor fabricated with 1 μM DNAzyme, corresponding to two or three orders of magnitude lower than the toxicity levels of Pb2+ in drinking water defined by WHO and USEPA. By tuning the surface coverage of DNAzyme, the sensitivity and dynamic range could be controlled. This sensor also featured high selectivity to Pb2+ ions and simple detection procedure. Successful detection of Pb2+ ions in groundwater indicates that this method has the prospect in the onsite detection of Pb2+ ions in water. Given the variety of AuNPs and metal-specific DNAzymes, this detection strategy would lead to the development of more sensitive and versatile heavy metal sensors.

As a promising technique in the field of material testing and with the very adaptive physical modeling of wave transmission process, terahertz wave was used to measure the dielectric properties of five commonly used insulation materials by two methods in this paper. When excluding the echo pulse from the reference signal and the sample signal, a better signal-noise ratio and a wider effective frequency band of spectrums can be obtained. Alternatively, the dielectric properties can also be achieved by separating the main pulse and echo pulse from the sample signal. The latter method makes the sampling of reference signal unnecessary. Furthermore, the dielectric properties of materials were also measured on a relative lower frequency band (1Hz-1MHz) by the broadband dielectric spectrometer.

Proper vehicle coordination and motion plan at road intersections are of importance to guarantee safety as well as improving the traffic throughput, fuel efficiency and so on. In this paper, we try to present a general dedicated intersection coordination framework for autonomous vehicles, where both high-and low-level planners are appropriately designed and integrated. In the high-level planner, two different strategies are formulated to coordinate the autonomous vehicles to generate reference trajectories and feasible ""tunnels"", respectively. Especially, a novel space-time-block based resource allocation scheme is presented to describe the feasible tunnels. Furthermore, to avoid collisions with unexpected obstacles such as pedestrians, bicycles or other vehicles with human drivers, a low-level planner is designed to generate practical trajectories based on the solutions from the high-level planner, according to their local on-board observations. Simulations and practical experiments are carried out, to show that our proposed coordination framework can achieve obvious performance advantages in various traffic metrics, including the throughput, fairness in driving maneuvers and driving comfort, etc. We also find that the high-level planner is effective in eliminating possible deadlocks among autonomous vehicles, which is rarely discussed in existing investigations.","[0.01538712, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00216165, 0.08344485, 0.0, 0.00718975, 0.00228349, 0.0, 0.01805024]",health_medicine,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01

To study market outcomes in this setting, we define a Joint Oligopoly-Oligopsony Model (JOOM) - an extended Cournot oligopoly model with imperfectly competitive labour market - and derive its Cournot-Nash equilibrium, featuring the relationship between market structure and market power, price and wage, output and employment, and investigate its welfare implications. We also extend the partial equilibrium welfare analysis to include Worker Surplus. By elevating Worker Surplus on a par with Consumer Surplus as suitable welfare standards, the JOOM makes apparent the potentially efficiency-enhancing function of labour union and minimum wage regulation, aimed at curbing oligopsony wage markdown power. We show that a lax merger control, which permits consolidation of market structure, can weaken the worker power in the form of reducing efficient minimum wage, as well as employment. Furthermore, we use the JOOM theory to investigate the effect of superstar firms on market outcomes. We show that the superstar firm hypothesis can explain the rise of average labour productivity, the fall of labour income share and wage stagnation at the industry level: all stylised facts consistent with the empirical findings of Autor et al (2020).

I argue that during this period of crisis, which is usually narrated in terms of conflict with Macedonia, Demosthenes confronts an internal crisis within the Assembly. While Demosthenes’ deliberative speeches have traditionally been defined as ‘Philippic’, this thesis argues that the speeches do not prioritise an ‘Anti- Macedonian’ agenda, but rather focus on confronting the corruption of the deliberative decision-making process. Due to an attitude of apathy and neglect, Demosthenes’ rhetoric suggests that their external problems are a direct product of this internal crisis, both of which are perpetuated by their failure to recognise how self-sabotaging practices undermine the polis from within. As he asserts in On the Chersonese and the Third Philippic, they cannot hope to deal with their external situation before they deal with their internal crisis. To address this, I argue that Demosthenes’ parrhēsia interweaves criticism of the dēmos with the praise of Athens, using social memory and past exempla both to recall and prescribe didactically the attitudes central to Athenian identity. As such, I propose that the deliberative speeches do not confront a ‘Macedonian Question’, but a fundamentally Athenian one.

Traditional clinical strategies are often limited by surgery‐related complications or unsatisfactory effects of long‐term drug administration. Inspired by the plaque‐binding ability of platelets, a biomimic photodynamic therapeutic system is designed to mitigate the progression of atherosclerotic plaques. This system is composed of photosensitizer‐loaded upconversion nanoparticle cores entrapped in the platelet membrane. The platelet membrane coating facilitates specific targeting of the therapeutic system to macrophage‐derived foam cells, the hallmark, and main component of early stage atherosclerotic plaques, which is firmly confirmed by in vivo fluorescent and single‐photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) radionuclide imaging. Importantly, in vivo phototherapy guided by SPECT/CT imaging alleviates plaque progression. Further immunofluorescence analysis reveals foam cell apoptosis and ameliorated inflammation.

White-collar crime itself offers the rare example of a criminological theory that has the attributes of an artifact - establishing a distinct criminal offence type within law and criminal justice and entering mainstream knowledge and terminology within half a century of inception. Despite this, white-collar cybercrime is a relatively new concept for cyber criminological analysis and is currently a rarity within the academic literature.

The most effective strategy is that patients with DKD should be diagnosed and treated early. Preliminary studies showed that the Chinese herbal Tangshen Formula (TSF) may delay the progression of DKD, reducing microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria and improving renal function. We designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of TSF in patients with DKD. Methods/design: This trial is a 13-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 632 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an experiment group (TSF plus losartan) and a control group (placebo plus losartan). The trial cycle will last 24 weeks. The primary outcome will be the change in the urine microalbumin-creatinine ratio from baseline to week 24. The secondary outcome will be the change in the rate of progression to the clinical proteinuria period after intervention, the rate of urine microalbumin negative conversion, the rate of normal urinary microalbumin, the doubling rate of the baseline creatinine value and the glomerular filtration rate between the two groups. Safety in medication will also be evaluated. Discussion: We hypothesize that patients with type 2 diabetes in the early stage of DKD will benefit from TSF.

To secure the power transmission system, it would be beneficial to detect the defects in their initial stage. In this paper, the terahertz technique combined with a deconvolution method was proposed, and a terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system was built. To validate the method proposed, three types of defects, namely single air gap defect, inclusion defect, and double-layer air gap defect were artificially prepared and tested. According to the test results, it was found that, compared with the traditional terahertz method, the air gap size that could lead to pulse overlapping was reduced from 1.22 mm to 0.57 mm. After the deconvolution process, air gap defect as small as 0.173 mm could be distinguished due to the shape characteristics of unipolar pulse. It was also found that when the defect was damp, the obtained waveform near the defect became smooth. The results of the present study demonstrate that terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS), combined with the deconvolution method, can have high potential in the detection of defects in composite insulators.","[0.00998023, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00329342, 0.00101224, 0.0510204, 0.00231876, 0.00259605, 0.004962, 0.00237468, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Methods: A total of 25 033 participants who attended the second resurvey of China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) were included in the study. We used data collected both at baseline (2004-2008) and at resurvey (2013-2014). A total of 13 chronic conditions were included, defined by self-reported, physical examination, and blood sample testing. Multimorbidity was defined as co-existence of two or more chronic conditions. Patterns of multimorbidity were explored using hierarchical cluster analysis. Results: The mean age of participants was (51.5±10.1) years at baseline and (59.5±10.2) years at second resurvey. The prevalence of multimorbidity increased from 33.5% to 58.1% over (8.0±0.8) years of follow-up. The average number of chronic conditions per person increased from 1.15 to 1.82 and all participants increased 0.42 conditions per 5 years on average. Participants who were older, less educated or lived in urban areas had a higher prevalence of multimorbidity and a higher increase in the number of chronic conditions. The increase in the number of chronic conditions was also higher among smokers and heavy alcohol drinkers. The most common multimorbidity pattern in the present population consisted of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and heart disease. Conclusions: The prevalence of multimorbidity in Chinese adults is increasing rapidly due to ageing population.

However, it is still a great challenge to manipulate optical polarization in all-fiberbased devices. Here we present a novel structural design of three-core fiber couplers to create arbitrary polarization management by embedding a vector mode segregated core within the conventional fiber couplers. We take advantages of these coupling structures to achieve polarization split, rotation, and exchange, as three essential polarization managements for fiber-guided modes. We study these couplers based on coupled-mode theory and numerically simulations. The obtained results show that they manifest favorable operation performance on management of the fiber modal polarization states. Compared to previous couplers used for management of power, wavelengths and modal forms, this kind of fiber couplers introduces a new manageable degree of freedom for modal polarization. It is expected that the presented all-fiber polarization-manageable directional couplers might find potential applications in fiber optical communications and sensing systems.","[0.02513775, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00432151, 0.0, 0.02078769, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0023498, 0.0, 0.00153999]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Exploring factors that may heighten or buffer the risk of mental health problems in this context is thus critical. Whilst compassion may be a protective factor, in contrast fears of compassion increase vulnerability to psychosocial distress and may amplify the impact of the pandemic on mental health. This study explores the magnifying effects of fears of compassion on the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on depression, anxiety and stress, and social safeness. Methods: Adult participants from the general population (N = 4057) were recruited across 21 countries worldwide, and completed self-report measures of perceived threat of COVID-19, fears of compassion (for self, from others, for others), depression, anxiety, stress, and social safeness. Results: Perceived threat of COVID-19 predicted increased depression, anxiety and stress. The three flows of fears of compassion predicted higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress and lower social safeness. All fears of compassion moderated (heightened) the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on psychological distress. Only fears of compassion from others moderated the effects of likelihood of contracting COVID-19 on social safeness. These effects were consistent across all countries. Conclusions: Fears of compassion have a universal magnifying effect on the damaging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and social safeness. Compassion focused interventions and communications could be implemented to reduce resistances to compassion and promote mental wellbeing during and following the pandemic.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.29259372, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",covid,"[1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 1.32028722e-06 1.00000000e-06

Methods PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and the Web of Science (WOS) databases were systematically searched up June 2020 for all relevant studies. The National Institute of Health (NIH) tool was used to assess the quality of all included studies. Inter-study heterogeneity was measured using the Chi-Squared and I² statistics, with the odds ratio (OR) being used as a measure of the pooled effect size. Results Out of the 561 records identified from the literature searches, eight articles (or 11 studies) were eligible for inclusion in the present meta-analysis. Using a random effects model, the results of the meta-analysis demonstrated statistically significant increases in helmet use among motorcycle riders (OR = 4.52, 95% CI: 1.01–20.14, I² = 99.9%) and passengers (OR = 6.57, 95% CI: 1.41–30.56, I² = 99.9%). The findings of sensitivity analyses, based on alternative levels of r for imputing the standard error (SE) of the ORs, showed the pooled OR of helmet use among motorcycle riders (r = 0.7; 3.49; 95% CI: 0.78, 16.44; r = 0.9; 3.49; 95% CI: 0.76, 16.11) was sensitive to different levels of r.

The aim was to compare how fear of COVID-19 is manifested in people living with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) compared to other GI conditions; and, how fear of COVID-19 is manifested across different demographic backgrounds (employment status, education level and country of residence) among IBD respondents using a large international sample. Methods Participants with a GI condition (≥18years of age) were recruited from 22 countries through a web-based questionnaire. Demographic, clinical, and psychosocial information was collected in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. An adaptation of the scale developed for IBD by Trindade & Ferreira (2020) measuring fear of COVID-19 (FoC; original items 1–9) and GI specific fear of COVID-19 (GI-FoC; new items 10–14) was used. Results In 831 participants (312 IBD), there were no significant differences in FoC between IBD and other GI conditions; whilst significant increases in GI-FoC were found in IBD respondents (mean [SD]: 13.5 [5.5] vs. 10.9 [5.0], p<0.01). The greatest fears of IBD respondents were: their condition would get worse; impact on access to medical support; being at increased risk of getting COVID-19; and being at increased risk of death if they got COVID-19. Among IBD respondents, persons on sick leave had significantly more general FoC than those who were employed, and significantly more GI-FoC compared to the employed or respondents outside of the labour market (Figures 1a and 1b).

The present research used the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to explore the psychological reasons underpinning intentions to use a mobile phone while driving in general, as well as to send and read text messages while driving across four different scenarios. Convenience sampling was used to obtain data from 314 participants who held a valid licence to drive in the UK, had driven at least once in the last six months and owned a mobile phone. General intentions to use a mobile phone while driving were predicted by positive Attitudes towards the behaviour and higher Perceived Behavioural Control. Moreover, when predicting intentions to send and read text messages, it was positive Attitudes that was the most consistent and significant predictor. Surprisingly, neither Perceived Behavioural Control nor Subjective Norms were significant predictors of intentions to send or read text messages. Furthermore, perceptions of risk (crashing and being apprehended by the police) were significant predictors of intentions to send and read texts over and above that provided by the TPB variables.

Hierarchical multiple regression predicting eating disorder behaviors (as assessed by the EDE-Q) from Weight Concerns (WCS) and BI-AAQ scores after controlling for BMI, produced a significant model, which accounted for 67% of variance. The BI-AAQ remained a significant predictor of eating disorder behaviors after controlling for BMI and weight concerns scores.

Methods We systematically searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science (WOS), and Scopus databases from November 1974 until June 2020 to identify before-after studies investigating the effect of mass media campaigns on seat belt use. The quality of all included studies was assessed using the National Institute of Health (NIH) tool. Chi-Squared tests and the I² statistic were used to evaluate inter-study heterogeneity, while the odds ratio (OR) was used as a measure of effect size. Results Of the 793 records initially identified, twenty articles were found to be appropriate for the current meta-analysis. Of these, 13, 5, and 2 studies were rated as good, fair, and poor quality, respectively. The meta-analysis finding using random effects model showed that mass media campaigns resulted in statistically significant increases in seat belt usage among drivers (OR= 1.40, 95% CI: 1.18- 1.68) and front seat passengers (OR= 1.54, 95% CI: 1.31- 1.82). Due to the presence of heterogeneity (I²: 99.7% for drivers; I²: 99.1% for front passengers), additional analyses were also undertaken. Sensitivity analyses showed that the pooled ORs remained consistent after removing each study one by one. Statistically significant increases in seat belt use among drivers were found in mass media campaigns which: had measurement periods longer than 12 months, were used in combination with enforcement activities, were published after 2000, and had good quality scores. Conclusion The current meta-analysis found that mass media campaigns

Electrolyte disorders particularly potassium abnormalities have been repeatedly reported as common clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Here, we discuss how SARS-CoV-2 may affect potassium balance by impairing the activity of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). The first hypothesis could justify the incidence of hypokalemia. SARS-CoV-2 cell entry through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may enhance the activity of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) classical axis and further leading to over production of aldosterone. Aldosterone is capable of enhancing the activity of ENaC and resulting in potassium loss from epithelial cells. However, type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) is able to inhibit the ENaC, but it is utilized in the case of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, therefore the ENaC remains activated. The second hypothesis describe the incidence of hyperkalemia based on the key role of furin. Furin is necessary for cleaving both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ENaC subunits. While the furin is hijacked by the virus, the decreased activity of ENaC would be expected, which causes retention of potassium ions and hyperkalemia. Given that the occurrence of hypokalemia is higher than hyperkalemia in COVID-19 patients, the first hypothesis may have greater impact on potassium levels. Further investigations are warranted to determine the exact role of ENaC in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.","[0.00052586, 0.0, 0.07966324, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.047704, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00204827]",covid,"[1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01

Additionally, studies have mostly maintained a `clinical approach' to musical performance anxiety, focusing on the diagnosis, assessment and treatment of maladaptive performance anxiety and its effects on selected groups of musicians. The aim of this thesis was to fill some of these gaps by exploring the experience of musical performance anxiety from the perspective of adolescent musicians. 410 students aged 12-19, all attending junior conservatoires and / or youth orchestras in the UK and Cyprus, responded to a self-report questionnaire. The questionnaire dealt with a range of learning and performance issues and yielded both quantitative and qualitative data. Performance anxiety was measured with the Adolescent Musicians' Performance Anxiety Scale (AMPAS), designed specifically for the needs of this study. Results revealed that performance anxiety was an issue for a significant percentage of students. Differences in performance anxiety level intensity were related to nationality and gender, but not to age. Susceptibility to experiencing performance anxiety, task efficacy and quality of performance environment were important factors in determining the intensity of experienced performance anxiety. Performance anxiety was found to be a multi-faceted construct, influenced by a variety of factors relating to self-perceptions, situational parameters, identity and culture, and family environment. Student attainment was influenced by performance anxiety. Achievement of higher Grades was related to the experience of higher levels of performance anxiety and perceptions of receiving positive feedback were

Based on previous underlying theory of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), the initial 50-item scale of AFQ converged into a short 8-item scale for youth (Greco, Lambert, & Baer 2008). The short version of the AFQ questionnaire (AFQ-Y8) was used. The AFQ was adapted in Greek and administered to high school students (mean age=14.79, SD=1.058) in the context of two larger studies from which results were merged to examine the questionnaires’ psychometric properties. An exploratory factor analysis with principal components extraction and an oblique rotation revealed a single factor accounting for 43.08% of the variability. A reliability analysis showed a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of .81 for the factor. The next step was to ensure that the AFQ-Y8 is correlated with theoretically expected outcomes (concurrent and predictive validity), thus, results will be presented as an explanation for its predictive and convergent validity testing the AFQ-Y8 with related and unrelated measures. Based on the results, AFQ-Y8 appears to have adequate internal consistency in the Greek speaking population. In conclusion, the Greek AFQ-Y8 is a useful tool in evaluating psychological inflexibility and for group-based research in adolescents.

The ensuing discussion points out that the life of excellence (arête) in all classical Greek philosophy culminates in the attainment of eudemonic being, equivocating likeness to the divine to the highest possible degree. The paper goes on to disclose significant differences concerning happiness between the moral and political philosophy of Aristotle and that of his predecessors, Socrates, and Plato. In turn, the present inquiry explores Aristotle's claim in EN that the education of a sufficient number of citizens of superior refinement best accomplishes human flourishing in both the private and public spheres. According to Aristotle, the paramount achievement of eudaimonia in individuals and the city-state happens through the moral and intellectual education of citizens of refinement in political science (politike episteme). Consequently, the present exploration carefully investigates the crux of Aristotle's vision of educating citizens of quality as this aspect of his ethics best illumines the holistic aim scope and curriculum of his proposed study in politike episteme (the science integrating all sciences). Finally, the present endeavor explores the superiority that Aristotle allots to contemplative or divine theoria in the latter part of his ethical treatise (Book X.7-8), where, he establishes a hierarchy between phrõnesis (practical wisdom) and theoria (contemplative wisdom), ascertaining the higher standing of the latter, a claim that inevitably leads him into paradox. Nevertheless, he also considers that perhaps contemplative wisdom surpasses divine reason, therefore, any form of duality between 'lower' an

People living with a chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorder might be particularly at risk of mental health complications given higher rates of comorbid anxiety and depression compared to the healthy population. As GI disorders affect up to 40% of the population worldwide, this international collaborative study seeks to evaluate the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on GI symptoms specifically and more generally on the well-being of those living with chronic GI conditions. Methods: A longitudinal survey with three time points (baseline, 6-month, and 12-month) will be conducted online. Adult participants with GI disorders from multiple countries will be recruited via patient associations, social media advertising, utilizing snowball sampling. Participants will be invited to complete a battery of questionnaires including demographic and health parameters, and measures of gastrointestinal symptoms, fear of COVID-19, perceived impact of COVID-19, illness perceptions, coping, depression, anxiety, stress, catastrophizing, and quality of life, using validated measures where available. Statistical analyses will include univariate descriptive models, multivariate models utilizing regression, mediation, and moderation, and latent growth models. Conclusions: This project may present novel information to the field of psychogastroenterology and may provide crucial information regarding the areas of impact for individuals with GI disorders during and following the pandemic.

Methods and results Ischemic heart disease was defined as acute myocardial infarction (MI) and chronic IHD (angina; asymptomatic IHD following MI). Cause of death ensemble modelling was used to produce fatality estimates. The prevalence of the non-fatal sequalae of IHD was estimated using DisMod MR 2.1. All estimates were presented as counts and age-standardized rates per 100 000 population. In 2019, IHD accounted for 197.2 million (177.7–219.5) prevalent cases, 9.1 million (8.4–9.7) deaths, and 182.0 million (170.2–193.5) DALYs worldwide. There were decreases in the global age-standardized prevalence rates of IHD [−4.6% (−5.7, −3.6)], deaths [−30.8% (−34.8, −27.2)], and DALYs [−28.6% (−33.3, −24.2)] from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, the global prevalence and death rates of IHD were higher among males across all age groups, while the death rate peaked in the oldest group for both sexes. A negative association was found between the age-standardized DALY rates and SDI. Globally, high systolic blood pressure (54.6%), high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (46.6%), and smoking (23.9%) were the three largest contributors to the DALYs attributable to IHD. Conclusion Although the global age-standardized prevalence, death, and DALY rates all decreased.

Evidence-based cognitive-behavioral (CB) interventions are now being implemented in schools at a group level to combat anxiety.Childhood emotional health should be considered a national and global priority for an effective strategy promoting the prevention of mental health. The aim of this study is the description of novel data on the effectiveness of preventive interventions for anxious children, as well as the study of selective parameters that appear to affect treatment outcome.Furthermore, a brief review is cited regarding two empirically supported interventions, which include the Friends and Pyramid Club program and the Super Skills for Life program. Schools are considered suitable places for all types of prevention programs; they provide a familiar environment to a child, and by providing access to the prevention programs to many children, school programs could be the ideal way for anxious young individuals to practice and generalize their skills. Schools also offer an ideal space for collaboration between teachers and mental health professionals. Most programs have been effective in reducing anxiety, especially those based on the principles of CB, where the effects appear to be independent of the professional status of the leader (trained teacher or mental health professional). Friends and Pyramid Club interventions are well-established, multifaceted, and cost-effective programs, which include combinations of techniques (mostly behavioral activation, cognitive preparation, teaching social skills, and relaxation techniques). Super Skills for Life is a promising program,

It appears that especially during times of uncertainty and high stress, conspiracy theories flourish and these can affect the way individuals behave, especially in response to governmental recommendations for social isolation and quarantine. Psychological flexibility, we hypothesized, may act as a protective factor in the relation between COVID-19 distress, conspiracy theory beliefs and consequent behaving. In this respect, the aim of this paper was to examine how conspiracy theory beliefs, COVID-19 distress, adherence behavior, and psychological flexibility interact. Participants were 1001 individuals (802 women; Mage=35.59years, SD= 10.07), who completed an online survey approximately one month after the first governmental measures of self-isolation and quarantine were enforced. Psychological flexibility was found to mediate the relation between conspiracy theory beliefs and compliance behavior. Further, being highly stressed appeared to increase the probability that a person will believe conspiracy theories, while such beliefs influenced whether a person would follow public health recommendations. Psychological flexibility appeared to be a protective factor at low and moderate distress levels. However, at high levels of COVID-19 distress, individuals prone to conspiracy theory beliefs would be less likely to conform to governmental public health recommendations irrespective of their psychological flexibility levels.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.19985686, 0.01712995, 0.0, 0.00816309, 0.01915596, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",covid,"[1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06

Despite extensive research investigating the risks associated with cell phone use while driving, social media campaigns to raise public awareness and a number of laws banning phone use while driving, this behaviour remains prevalent throughout the world. The current study was conducted in Iran, where road traffic injuries are the leading causes of death and disability, and where drivers continue to use their cell phones, despite legislative bans restricting this behaviour. A total of 255 drivers in the city of Mashhad (male = 66.3%; mean age = 30.73 years; SD = 9.89) completed either an online or a paper-based survey assessing the self-reported frequency of using a cell phone while driving. Psychosocial factors contributing to cell phone use while driving and support for legislation restricting this behaviour, as well as the Big Five personality traits, were also measured. Overall, the results showed that almost 93% of drivers use their cell phones while driving at least once a week, with 32.5% reporting they always use their cell phones while driving. Ordinal logistic regression revealed that the presence of a child passenger, age, perceived benefits and risks of using cell phones while driving, as well as the perceived ability to drive safely while using a cell phone, were strongly associated with the frequency of cell phone use while driving.

Lack of social support, psychiatric history, childhood trauma, additional stressful events in the past month, and low resilience predicted more mental health problems for COVID-19 and other stressful events. Higher COVID-19 country impact was associated with increased mental health impact of both COVID-19 and other stressful events.

The disciple of evolutionary psychology is based on the premise that human behavior is generated by a collection of brain modules or adaptations that have evolved to produce fitness-increasing outcomes in the ancestral environment. Thus, understanding human behavior requires understanding the nature and function of these adaptations, which in turn, requires reconstructing the ancestral human condition. By identifying the typical patterns of life in contemporary pre-industrial societies, cross-cultural anthropological research constitutes a valid way to reconstruct the way of life of ancestral pre-industrial societies. Moreover, cross-cultural historical research could be used to reconstruct the way of life in the later period of human evolution. Furthermore, evolutionary psychology is based on the premise that adaptations are universal: Behavior arises from evolved mechanisms that most humans share. Thus, many evolutionary hypotheses require cross-cultural research in order to be tested. Finally, in the evolutionary psychological perspective, behavioral adaptations are not rigid mechanisms, but are responsive to environmental conditions. Accordingly, cross-cultural research is necessary for understanding the range of behaviors that these mechanisms can produce in different settings.","[0.03967054, 0.00493119, 0.00861215, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02621413, 0.00893848, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01629323, 0.01998188]",politics,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06

The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially affected many groups within the general population, but particularly those with extant clinical conditions, such as having or being treated for cancer. Cancer patients are at a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 since the malignancy and chemotherapy may negatively affect the immune system, and their immunocompromised condition also increases the risk of infection. Substantial international efforts are currently underway to develop specific methods for diagnosing and treating COVID-19. However, cancer patients’ risk profiles, management, and outcomes are not well understood.

The present article examined the potential mechanisms of hypokalemia and hyperkalemia in patients suffering from COVID-19, in order to raise awareness of potassium disorders in SARS-CoV-2 infections. PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched with keywords, such as ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""2019-nCoV"", ""Hypokalemia"", ""Hyperkalemia"", ""Serum potassium"", and ""Etiology"", ""Pathophysiology"" up to April 20, 2021 without any search filters. We included articles that proposed potential mechanisms for potassium abnormalities in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we used backward and forward citation searching. Potassium abnormalities are considered to be important electrolyte disturbances, with reported incidences ranging from < 5% to > 50% in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, understanding the etiologies of potassium abnormalities could help to improve disease outcome. Utilization of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 in the renal cells, viral-induced tubular injury, and gastrointestinal abnormalities, such as anorexia, diarrhea, and vomiting may predispose COVID-19 patients to developing hypokalemia. Furthermore, depleted magnesium levels make hypokalemia refractory to treatments. In addition, hyperkalemia may occur because of reduced urinary output, as a consequence of renal failure. Changes in blood pH and medication-induced side-effects are other possible reasons for the deviation of potassium levels from the normal range.

Methods: In total, 957 participants completed an online survey during the first lockdown, 134 of whom completed a similar survey again during the second lockdown. The outcomes assessed included stress, positive and negative affect, and well-being. Results: The results indicated no population-wide severe reactions in the participants. Repeated measures analyses showed similar mental health levels during both the first and the second lockdowns. Further inspection of participants’ scores indicated that, for all mental health variables, approximately half of the participants improved, while the other half deteriorated.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns have deprived people of major sources of social support and coping, with others representing threats. Hence, a major stressor during the pandemic has been a sense of social disconnection and loneliness. This study explores how people’s experience of compassion and feeling socially safe and connected, in contrast to feeling socially disconnected, lonely and fearful of compassion, effects the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on post-traumatic growth and post-traumatic stress. Methods Adult participants from the general population ( N = 4057) across 21 countries worldwide, completed self-report measures of social connection (compassion for self, from others, for others; social safeness), social disconnection (fears of compassion for self, from others, for others; loneliness), perceived threat of COVID-19, post-traumatic growth and traumatic stress. Results Perceived threat of COVID-19 predicted increased post-traumatic growth and traumatic stress. Social connection (compassion and social safeness) predicted higher post-traumatic growth and traumatic stress, whereas social disconnection (fears of compassion and loneliness) predicted increased traumatic symptoms only. Social connection heightened the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on post-traumatic growth, while social disconnection weakened this impact. Social disconnection magnified the impact of the perceived threat of COVID-19 on traumatic stress. These effects were consistent across all countries.

Methods: Outcomes assessed were self-reported perceived stress, depression symptom, and sleep changes. The predictors examined included sociodemographic factors and perceived social support. Results: The results demonstrated that half of the HCWs had moderate levels of perceived stress and symptoms of depression. Half of the HCWs ( n = 800, 51.4%) had similar sleeping patterns since the pandemic started, and one in four slept more or slept less. HCWs reported less perceived stress and depression symptoms and higher levels of perceived social support than the general population who participated in the same project. Predictors associated with higher perceived stress and symptoms of depression among HCWs included female sex, not having children, living with parents, lower educational level, and lower social support.

Furthermore, 264 participants from 30 different countries reported being cancer patients. The median age was 51.5 years, 79.9% were female, and 28% had breast cancer. Cancer participants reported higher self-efficacy to follow recommended national guidelines regarding COVID-19 protective behaviors compared to non-cancer participants (p < 0.01). They were less stressed (p < 0.01), more psychologically flexible (p < 0.01), and had higher levels of positive affect compared to non-cancer participants. Amongst cancer participants, the majority (80.3%) reported COVID-19, not their cancer, as their priority during the first wave of the pandemic and females reported higher levels of stress compared to males. In conclusion, cancer participants appeared to have handled the unpredictable nature of the first wave of the pandemic efficiently, with a positive attitude towards an unknown and otherwise frightening situation.

Four variables of the theory of planned behaviour (general attitude and intention towards phone use while driving, social norms towards mobile phone use, perceived behavioural control, the specific beliefs about being able to engage in distracting activities and drive safely), and type A behaviour pattern were also collected. The results showed that, during the last year, 65% of drivers had read a text message and 49% had written a text using mobile phone applications. Likewise, a substantial proportion of the sample reported using social media while driving, by checking (34%), sending or typing a post (25%) on social network applications.

However, the evidence has become somewhat fragmented, making it challenging to understand driver education's effectiveness for improving road safety. The current study aimed to provide the efficacy of pre-LDE and post-LDE interventions aimed at improving the safety of drivers (includes crashes, injuries, or secondary outcomes). Methods: The following online databases were searched up to the 21st of February 2020: Web of Science (WOS), Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane library, and other relevant databases. Systematic reviews (SR) and meta-analyses were selected to investigate the efficacy of driving education in reducing crashes, injuries, or secondary outcomes. Two investigators independently conducted the data extraction and used the assessment of multiple systematic reviews (AMSTAR) tool to conduct a quality assessment of each SR identified. Results: Out of the 229 potential articles, seven SRs were eligible for the current overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This overview showed that pre-and post-license education by people of all ages led to improvements in secondary outcomes, such as performance, self-perceived driving abilities, behind-the-wheel driving performance, and even a small decrease in traffic offenses. However, education was not effective in reducing crashes or injuries, either at the individual or community level. Conclusions: There was no evidence that driver education is an effective approach to reducing crashes or injuries. This negative result might be due to ineffective teaching methods.

Such a complex array of stressors potentially lead to symptoms of adjustment disorder. OBJECTIVE This cross-sectional exploratory study examined relationships between risk and protective factors, stressors, and symptoms of adjustment disorder during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Data from the first wave of the European Society of Traumatic Stress Studies (ESTSS) longitudinal ADJUST Study were used. N = 15,563 participants aged 18 years and above were recruited in eleven countries (Austria, Croatia, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Sweden) from June to November 2020. Associations between risk and protective factors (e.g. gender, diagnosis of a mental health disorder), stressors (e.g. fear of infection, restricted face-to-face contact), and symptoms of adjustment disorder (ADNM-8) were examined using multivariate linear regression. RESULTS The prevalence of self-reported probable adjustment disorder was 18.2%. Risk factors associated with higher levels of symptoms of adjustment disorder were female gender, older age, being at risk for severe COVID-19 illness, poorer general health status, current or previous trauma exposure, a current or previous mental health disorder, and longer exposure to COVID-19 news.

We aimed to explore the association between the pandemic-related product shortages and psychological distress in people with GI disorders. Methods This online cross-sectional survey was nested within an ongoing, international, prospective study of well-being in people with GI disorders. The study was advertised in multiple countries in May-September 2020 via patient organizations and social media. The primary outcome measure was distress, evaluated by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. We utilized linear regressions, adjusting for covariates and testing individual moderation effects. Key Results Overall, 831 people completed the survey from 27 countries, of whom 82% were female (mean age = 49 years). The most common disorders included inflammatory bowel disease (n = 322), celiac disease (n = 273), and irritable bowel syndrome (n = 260). Significant problems accessing food were reported by 19.8%, non-medical therapies by 16%, toilet paper by 10.8%, and essential medication by 8.9% of the sample (>5% pain medication). There was a positive association between toilet paper and pain medication shortages and distress, and a negative association between food shortages and distress. Significant moderation effects were identified for COVID-19 prevalence and toilet paper and food shortages, and between COVID-19 fear and pain medication shortages.

The main aim of the study was to examine the mediating role of Facebook intrusion between positive capital and general distress. Positive capital was considered as comprising self-esteem, ego-resiliency, and self-control, while general distress was seen as having three dimensions: depression, anxiety, and stress. Methods: The sample consisted of N = 4,495 participants ( M = 22.96 years, SD = 5.46) from 14 countries: Australia, Cyprus, Greece, Hong Kong, Lithuania, New Zealand, Peru, Poland, Russia, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and United States. We used the following methods: the Facebook Intrusion Questionnaire (FIQ), the Self-Esteem Scale (SES), the Brief Self-Control Scale (SCS), The Ego Resiliency Revised Scale and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Results: We found that Facebook intrusion was a mediator between self-esteem and general distress and between self-control and general distress. Limitations: The present study was based on a cross-sectional study, and the measures used were self-report measures. The majority of the participants were recruited using convenience sampling.

The present study reports the global, regional and national burden of anemia and its underlying causes between 1990 and 2019, by age, sex and socio-demographic index (SDI). Methods Publicly available data on the point prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) were retrieved from the global burden of disease (GBD) 2019 study for 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2019. The point prevalence, YLD counts and rates per 100,000 population were presented, along with their corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals. Results In 2019, the global age-standardized point prevalence and YLD rates for anemia were 23,176.2 (22,943.5–23,418.6) and 672.4 (447.2–981.5) per 100,000 population, respectively. Moreover, the global age-standardized point prevalence and YLD rate decreased by 13.4% (12.1–14.5%) and 18.8% (16.9–20.8%), respectively, over the period 1990–2019. The highest national point prevalences of anemia were found in Zambia [49327.1 (95% UI: 46,838.5–51,700.1)], Mali [46890.1 (95% UI: 44,301.1–49,389.8)], and Burkina Faso [46117.2 (95% UI: 43,640.7–48,319.2)]. In 2019, the global point prevalence of anemia was highest in the 15–19 and 95+ age groups in females and males, respectively. Also, the burden of anemia was lower in regions with higher socio-economic development. Globally, most of the prevalent cases were attributable to dietary iron deficiency, as well as hemoglobinopathies and hemolytic anemias. Conclusions Anemia remains a major health problem, especially among females in less developed countries. T

This study investigated student typologies in adolescent instrumental learners. Participants included 410 learners who completed the Young Musicians’ Performance Questionnaire. K-Means cluster analysis revealed three typologies: Cluster 1 – moderately anxious students evidencing lower levels of motivation and feeling ineffective but guarding their self-esteem; Cluster 2 – highly anxious students evidencing negative self-perceptions and being susceptible to experiencing maladaptive MPA; Cluster 3 – low anxious students evidencing high levels of motivation and confidence and inclined toward experiencing adaptive MPA. The 3-cluster solution effectiveness was validated with discriminant analysis. Significant associations between examination achievement and cluster membership revealed variations between clusters.

While autonomous vehicle technology is developing rapidly, much less attention and resources have been devoted to understanding the acceptance, attitudes, and preferences of vehicle automatization among driver groups, such as the elderly. In this study, 236 elderly drivers (≥65 years) evaluated four vehicles representing SAE levels 2–5 in terms of safety, trustworthiness, enjoyment, reliability, comfort, ease of use, and attractiveness, as well as reporting preferences for vehicles employing each of the four levels of automation. The results of a repeated-measures ANOVA showed that the elderly drivers rated the SAE level 2 vehicle highest and the fully automated vehicle (SAE 5) lowest across all attributes. The preference for the vehicle declined as a function of increasing automatization. The seven attributes formed an internally coherent “attitude to automatization” scale, a strong correlate of vehicle preference. Age or annual mileage were not related to attitudes or preferences for automated vehicles. The current study shows that elderly drivers' attitudes toward automatization should be studied further, and these results should be taken into account when developing automated vehicles. The full potential of automatization may not be realized if elderly drivers are ignored.","[0.00508814, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00415208, 0.067297, 0.0, 0.00200664, 0.00304442, 0.00083186, 0.02136357]",health_medicine,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

The impact of these lockdowns on mental health is inadequately understood. On the one hand such drastic changes in daily routines could be detrimental to mental health. On the other hand, it might not be experienced negatively, especially because the entire population was affected. Methods The aim of this study was to determine mental health outcomes during pandemic induced lockdowns and to examine known predictors of mental health outcomes. We therefore surveyed n = 9,565 people from 78 countries and 18 languages. Outcomes assessed were stress, depression, affect, and wellbeing. Predictors included country, sociodemographic factors, lockdown characteristics, social factors, and psychological factors. Results Results indicated that on average about 10% of the sample was languishing from low levels of mental health and about 50% had only moderate mental health. Importantly, three consistent predictors of mental health emerged: social support, education level, and psychologically flexible (vs. rigid) responding. Poorer outcomes were most strongly predicted by a worsening of finances and not having access to basic supplies. Conclusions These results suggest that on whole, respondents were moderately mentally healthy at the time of a population-wide lockdown. The highest level of mental health difficulties were found in approximately 10% of the population. Findings suggest that public health initiatives should target people without social support and those whose finances worsen as a result of the lockdown. Interventions that promote psychological flexibility may mitigate the impact of the pandemic.","[0.0, 0.01085975, 0.3328773, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0103884, 0.0130514, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02528802, 0.0]",covid,"[1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06

Recent research has tried to shift focus away from simplistic interpretations of social work as an unshakably ‘benevolent’ profession. A recent emphasis on social work’s colonial legacies and the structural causes of political violence provide us with important new directions on how to rethink and reshape social work education and practice in these contexts. Cyprus presents a very interesting, yet under-explored, case study as it remains an island de facto divided, along ethnic lines. The division has resulted in the physical and political separation of the two most populous ethnic communities (Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots). United Nations (UN)-sponsored peace talks have gained momentum in recent years. This paper offers the first systematic exploration of the views of social work students across both sides of the divide. Through a mixed-method approach, students were able to express their thoughts and beliefs on ‘the other’ and on social work in the post-conflict realities.

Results from an Exploratory Factor Analysis demonstrated that the Portuguese version of the CompACT statistically performed better without 5 items from the Openness to Experience subscale. The 18-item Portuguese-adapted CompACT presented significant correlations in the expected directions and with the expected magnitudes with AAQ-II, CFQ-7, MAAS, CAQ-8, and DASS-21. Partial metric invariance was demonstrated between the Portuguese-adapted 18-item CompACT and the original CompACT in a UK sample. The non-correspondence between responses to these versions may be due to differences between the Portuguese and British cultures. This study contributes with the adaptation of the original CompACT to the Portuguese language and with the refinement of this instrument to an 18-item measure of psychological flexibility, that appears to be adequate for use in Portuguese samples.

Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), which quantify the total burden of years lost due to premature death or disability, were also estimated per 100000 population. All estimates were reported along with their corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). Results: In 2017, there were 5.5 million (UI 4.9-6.2) transport-related incident cases in the EMR - a substantial increase from 1990 (2.8 million; UI 2.5-3.1).

Choosiness had also a significant effect, but only on voluntary singlehood, with high scorers being more likely to prefer to be single than low scorers.","[0.0, 0.03483624, 0.0, 0.06352593, 0.0, 0.0, 0.06232231, 0.00633211, 0.00461036, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",women,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

The heterogeneity of driving anxiety means that treatment often needs to address multiple areas of anxiety, cognition, and behaviour, and psychometric measures are an important part of individualised treatment and outcome measurement. There are several measures of driving anxiety, but their psychometric properties in non-clinical samples have not been adequately researched. The present study investigated the psychometric properties of three measures of driving anxiety, the Driving Cognitions Questionnaire (DCQ), Driving Situations Questionnaire (DSQ), and Driving Behavior Survey (DBS). In total, 420 participants from the New Zealand electoral roll completed a survey containing the three measures of driving anxiety, a measure of aberrant driving behaviour (the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire) and demographic and descriptive variables. The three driving anxiety scales demonstrated strong concurrent validity and the DSQ had strong discriminant validity. However, the discriminant validity findings for the DCQ and DBS were mixed. Further research is needed to evidence the psychometric properties of these measures of driving anxiety, so they can be of maximum benefit in designing tailored psychological treatment approaches.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0104243331, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00120094394, 0.109801483, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00483695493, 9.83403617e-05, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

A total of 749 Cypriot secondary school students, aged 12 to 14 years, responded to a survey addressing enjoyment of music, motivation for school music lessons, and perceptions of the music classroom environment. The survey included a questionnaire with six subscales: Involvement, Affiliation, Teacher Support, Task Orientation, Order and Organization, and Rule Clarity. High ratings for Affiliation, Teacher Support, and Rule Clarity suggest that, overall, students’ perceptions of the classroom environment were positive. They were not uniform, but varied on the basis of student characteristics. Girls rated Rule Clarity higher than boys. Younger students tended to rate Task Orientation, Order and Organization, and Rule Clarity higher than older students. Higher-achieving students tended to rate Affiliation and Teacher Support higher. Older boys rated Involvement lower than younger boys, whereas older girls rated Involvement higher than younger girls. It can be inferred that boys experienced a gradual increase in perceived Affiliation as their achievement improved, although the pattern was less consistent for girls. Girls tended to report higher motivation for school music lessons than boys. Motivation was enhanced by classroom environments in which students experienced higher levels of enjoyment of music, engagement, and support from teachers.

Numerous studies have supported the association of adverse childhood experiences with non-suicidal self-injury. However, the majority of the measures used were limited to basic forms of abuse and neglect, indicating a need for the use of a more inclusive measure, such as the ACE-IQ. The psychometric properties of the measure though have only been briefly investigated with other populations, suggesting that a more thorough examination might be beneficial before its use. Method: Two hundred eighty-four adult participants (77.5% females) with a mean age of 23.4 (SD=5.7) were recruited online via specific self-harm groups on social media platforms. Participants were asked to complete an online survey consisting of three self-report measures regarding early childhood experiences and engagement in non-suicidal self-injury. Results: The findings of this study supported ACE-IQ’s reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.854), convergent validity (r= 0.85, p<0.001 with the CTQ-SF), predictive validity (R² = 0.12, p=0.001 of the SHI total score) and discriminant validity (F-value = 13.90, p<0.001). An exploration of the factor structure demonstrated a 5-factor solution (physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, exposure to violence, family environment).

Research Question What is the global, regional and national burden of asthma in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2019, by age, sex and socio-demographic index (SDI)? Study Design and Methods Publicly available data from the Global Burden of Disease study were used over the period 1990 to 2019. All estimates were presented as counts and age-standardised rates per 100,000, along with their associated uncertainty intervals (UIs). Results In 2019, the global age-standardised point prevalence and death rates for asthma were 3415.5 and 5.8 per 100,000, which represent a 24% and 51.3% decrease since 1990, respectively. Moreover, in 2019 the global age-standardised DALY rate was 273.6 and the global point prevalence of asthma was highest in the 5-9 age group. Also in 2019, the USA (10399.3) had the highest age-standardised point prevalence rate of asthma. Generally, the burden of asthma decreased with increasing socio-demographic index (SDI). Globally, high body mass index (16.9%), smoking (9.9%) and occupational asthmagens (8.8%) contributed to the 2019 asthma DALYs. Interpretation Asthma remains an important public health issue, particularly in regions with low socio-economic development. Future research is needed to thoroughly examine the associations asthma has with its risk factors and the factors impeding optimal self-management.

In the domain of mating, these interests, along with other factors such as the trade-offs inherent in mating, give rise to an opportunity cost of free mate choice: Parents have much to lose if they allow their children to exercise choice freely. This opportunity cost provides a strong incentive to parents to influence their children's mate choices. In preindustrial societies, parents manage to exercise direct control, which is predominantly manifested in the institution of arranged marriage. In postindustrial societies, parents exercise influence indirectly through manipulation. Ultimately, parental influence over mating gives rise to a sexual selection force, namely parental choice, which may be unique to the human species.","[0.00705535, 0.02995217, 0.0, 0.00815108, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.19176712, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",child_family,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

Parent-offspring conflict over mating is manifested in the allocation of parental investment, where children want more than their fair share of parental resources. Mating is another domain where parent-offspring conflict over mating is manifested. The individuals who children consider optimal as mates are not considered optimal as in-laws by their parents. This conflict of interests results in parental attempts to control children’s mate choices, and children’s attempts to escape from this control.

Methods Data from the Global Burden of Diseases Study (GBD) 2019 were used. GBD 2019 modelled the prevalence of GBS using hospital and claims data. Years lived with disability (YLDs) were estimated as the product of the GBS prevalence and the disability weight. This article also reported proportions in the age-standardised prevalence rate that were due to six underlying causes of GBS. Results In 2019, there were 150,095 [95% uncertainty intervals (UI) 119,924 to 188,309] total cases of GBS worldwide, which resulted in 44,407 (95% UI 28,016 to 64,777) YLDs. Globally, there was a 6.4% (95% UI 3.6 to 9.5) increase in the age-standardised prevalence of GBS per 100,000 population between 1990 and 2019. High-income Asia Pacific [1.9 (95% UI: 1.5 to 2.4)] and East Asia [0.8 (95% UI: 0.6 to 1.0)] had the highest and lowest age-standardised prevalence rates (per 100,000), respectively, in 2019. Nationally, Japan [6.4 (95% UI: 5.3 to 7.7)] and China [0.8 (95% UI: 0.6 to 1.0)] had the highest and lowest age-standardised prevalence rates (per 100,000). The age-standardised burden of GBS increased with increasing age and was higher in males in all age groups. Furthermore, the age-standardised prevalence of GBS (per 100,000) had a positive association with the level of development, as measured by SDI, although this association was not strong. Upper respiratory infections and unknown causes accounted for the highest proportions of underlying causes. Conclusions Globally, the prevalence of GBS continues to increas

The growth in the numbers of older people is one of the most important factors increasing the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) on society. The Tabriz Older People Survey (TOPS) aimed to understand the socio-demographics, health-related behaviors, and health profile of older adults. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on a representative sample of 1362 community dwelling older adults in Tabriz, the most populated city in the northwest of Iran. The sampling method was probability proportionate to size (PPS). Data collection was conducted in the households of the participants from summer 2019 to winter 2020. Trained interviewers administered the questionnaire, which measured socio-demographics, anthropometrics, social support, sleep quality, mental health, past medical history, dietary habits, traditional medicine, physical activity, and other health-related behaviors. Results: The sample of 1362 consisted of 56.4% fameless and 54.4% were young older people (60-69 years old). Almost half of the sample were completely illiterate. There was no daily walking in 13.3% of the sample, with women reporting a more sedentary lifestyle than males. Out of the 1362 participants, 135 (9.9%) were current smokers, which was higher in males (20.9% vs. 1.5%) and more than 88% of people who lived alone were women. In terms of sleep quality, anxiety, depression, cognitive status, daily functioning, and social support, men were significantly better than women.

This study, based on analysis of data collected among 3,331 adolescents aged 13-17 from 48 randomly selected schools in government-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, provides an ecological and evidence-driven approach to exploring, firstly, how conflict exposure and other adversities impact on key development outcomes, and secondly, how life skills, school connectedness and family connectedness can provide protective buffers. Specifically, the study found that conflict exposure is associated with a broad range of internalizing and externalizing mental health problems; whereas exposure to micro-systemic violence (e.g. family abuse, school victimization) is additionally associated with school drop-out tendency and reduced readiness for civic participation. As for sources of resilience, the study found that collaborative skills and executive skills, in combination with parent support and teacher support, contribute most to resilience in adolescents exposed to violence in their microsystem. In contrast, adolescents that are resilient in the face of conflict exposure are more likely to be characterized by supportive relationships with peers, emotional connection to the school, inter-dependent values, collaborative problem-solving skills and tolerance of diversity. The study then goes on to explore in greater detail the specific role that can be played by the education system, measured through the concept of school connecte

This chapter proposes a rethinking of the integration-related policies by locating the problem areas. Mechanisms for intervention and regulation of the informal labour markets have been severely curtailed by the neoliberal reforms since the 1980s. Therefore, immigration and labour policies are generating and reproducing vulnerable irregulars occupying marginal labour market positions; migrant women represent the core of the global precariat. Also, public debates on irregular work by migrants and particularly migrant women generally misrepresent the social realities as narrated by migrant workers themselves.

Our findings highlight both cultural universals and cultural variation. We find a universal negative relation between appropriateness ratings of norm violations and appropriateness ratings of responses in the form of confrontation, social ostracism and gossip. Moreover, we find the country variation in the appropriateness of sanctions to be consistent across different norm violations but not across different sanctions. Specifically, in those countries where use of physical confrontation and social ostracism is rated as less appropriate, gossip is rated as more appropriate.","[0.0115074, 0.00467255, 0.02696806, 0.00361383, 0.0, 0.06621058, 0.01693575, 0.0, 0.00743619, 0.00984939, 0.0, 0.01640423]",education,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06

We aim to analyse geographical access to emergency medical services (EMSs) and hospital emergency units by EMS in relation to deprivation in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA), Portugal. Design This study estimates road network-based access times from the centroids of statistical sections (census block groups equivalent) to locations of EMS and hospital emergency services. Each statistical section has been linked to a Material Deprivation Index (MDI). A non-parametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) was undertaken to compare MDI-linked statistical sections in terms of access to emergency care. Geographical access analysis was conducted for 2018. Primary outcome measure Road network-based access time (in minutes) for EMSs to statistical sections and then on to emergency units in hospitals. Results Overall, 82.4% of the LMA population is located less than a 10 min drive from an EMS without transport, and 99.1% from an EMS with transport. Travel time from EMS with transport to hospital is potentially less than 20 min for 95.2% of the population. However, 63.1% of residents living beyond a 30 min threshold (total time from emergency call to hospital arrival) are in areas with very high MDI (18.8% in high MDI, 13.3% in medium MDI, 4.7% in low MDI, 0% in very low MDI). Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA confirms discrepancies in access times between better-off and poorer areas. Conclusion Poorer areas experience worse geographical access to EMS and hospital emergency units.

Designed with the aim to capture the value that nature should represent for society, the concept of ES has been gradually introduced into the realm of the market (Gómez-Baggethun et al., 2010). Nowadays, it is argued that Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) help to reverse the degradation of ecosystems, its services and biodiversity and even help to restore the latter. Furthermore, it is said to reduce poverty and create a novel “urban–rural compact” since it transfers funds from consumers of ES to the providers responsible for their provisions (Kosoy & Corbera, 2010, p. 1228). Heavy critiques have arisen of the utilitarian approach to nature, especially the mainstreaming of the economic approach to nature (cf. Gómez-Baggethun et al., 2010; McCaubley, 2006; Corbera et al., 2007). However, they are still seen as the dominant mechanism to attain sustainability. Some authors are even proposing that, if significantly altered and reframed, PES could help to trigger a transition to sustainability (Muniz & Cruz, 2015). It is in this realm that our paper has to be positioned. It has the double aim of 1) inquiring into how the PES mechanism functions, in order to 2) find out which are the main limitations and constraints of this approach to value ecosystems. For this undertaking we look at the hypothetical case of a rural unsustainable community in Southern Europe and ask ourselves under which premises the PES mechanism could help the community to transition to a real sustainability state, framed by the transition literature.

The problem is that efforts toward prejudice reduction may serve to suppress genuine efforts to change. We propose the Achieving Multicultural Integration of Groups Across Society (AMIGAS) model, in which a multicultural commitment is proposed as a driver of both improved intergroup evaluations and promotion of collective action for reduced inequality, especially in contexts where there are conditions for a respectful intercultural dialogue.

Prosumerism or self-consumption is an important part of this citizen involvement. While the new EU regulatory framework for energy now recognises civic-inspired prosumer initiatives such as energy communities, little is known about the full range and diversity of collective actors in renewable energy self-consumption as well as how they engage with the changing energy system. This paper presents an exploratory categorisation of the different collective social actors that produce and consume energy from renewable sources, referred to as 'collective RES prosumers', aiming to clarify their participation in the energy landscape.

One of the project’s main objectives was to develop a tool to evaluate European students’ initial knowledge when configuring their beliefs and perceptions about different science topics. Once the tool (platform) had been designed, the next step consisted of carrying out activities (Science camps), which would allow validating the platform and identifying changes in perception (through questionnaires with Likert scales), which students experienced during their participation in training activities, organised within the framework of the project. For this, five Science camps were organised in five European universities, two in central Europe (Germany, Slovakia), and three nations in southern Europe (Portugal, Spain and Italy). Therefore, we make sure to cover differences related to socio-geopolitical issues. The topics that were chosen for the debate were climate change, genetically-modified organisms (GMOs), complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) and vaccines, and it was expected that around 100 students would participate in each of the universities of the PERSIST_EU consortium (Valencia, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Trnava, Lisbon, and Vicenza).","[0.02490746, 0.0, 0.00049223, 0.0, 0.02854965, 0.17735115, 0.00305571, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.030846]",education,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

Literature review-based research was conducted to examine the types of NbS implemented, the common drivers, the governance model, and the plural functionalities of the solutions. The research shows that, despite the differences, the two cities shared common drivers (including water supply, flood control, and resident demand for green space) and goals, such as improving water quality and overall quality of life, through the deployment of NbS.

In Europe, trust in existing elected democratic institutions is fading while authoritarian nationalist movements grow. Experiences of neglect, ignorance, and inferiority are one explanation for this. This paper explores the link between the experiences of households in a state of energy poverty and their trust in institutions and social networks. Using qualitative data from ten different European countries, we show that a lack of trust in both public and private institutions is widespread among energy-poor households. Our interviewees show distrust in various dimensions. In their contacts with institutions, they report experiences of powerlessness, bad and unfair treatment, and feelings of inferiority. While some interviewees do trust single individuals within institutions, others trust only their own social networks and some have no trust in anyone. We further show how trust in networks or (people in) institutions can strengthen the coping capacities of energy-poor households while a lack of trust even cuts people off from the support they could attain and thus deepens their state of energy poverty.","[0.03943291, 0.0, 0.01240179, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00743972, 0.00418296, 0.00329434, 0.01932233, 0.0, 0.02536829, 0.0]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

Yet, there is little research on how attitudes towards technocracy may impact European citizens' political behaviour. Moreover, the consistency of technocracy supporters' political attitudes, especially towards the EU, is questionable. This paper uses new survey panel data collected before and after the European parliament elections in May 2019 in six countries (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain). We investigate how citizens’ technocratic attitudes affect their voting behaviour in the European elections. We find evidence that citizens with technocratic attitudes are less likely to support mainstream parties, and tend to either abstain or, if they vote, to give their vote to anti-system parties, especially from the populist right. In addition, by distinguishing technocracy supporters according to their partisanship, we conclude that technocracy is a thin ideology that can be combined with different patterns of political support: while many technocracy supporters have no party identification or support non-mainstream parties and show dissatisfaction with democracy and the EU, another subgroup of technocracy supporters identifies with a mainstream political party and show above average political support and support for the EU.","[0.05429565, 0.0, 0.00677094, 0.03741919, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00254005, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00070843, 0.0, 0.02401522]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

The aim of the current study is to overcome this gap and shed light on how food and eating practices are experienced by families at the end‐of‐life. An ethnographic research was developed in two Portuguese palliative care units: participant observation was conducted during 10 months and in‐depth interviews were carried out with 10 patients with a life‐threatening illness, 20 family members and 20 palliative care professionals. Food is not only a matter of nutrition in a biological sense, but also an act of giving care to patients with a life‐threatening illness. The findings suggest that food and eating practices affect the processes of relationality and of doing family at the end‐of‐life in Portugal. Attention is particularly paid to gender differences. The study supports recent sociological research which understands the dying process as a relational experience and intends to develop sociological knowledge on the materialities of care.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00776745, 0.01540798, 0.1619171, 0.0, 0.13997534, 0.0]",economy,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

Cross-cultural research with adults reveals a consensus regarding values’ structure and priorities. Research with young populations is still very recent, but has already provided relevant theoretical and empirical insights. In this systematic review, we have aimed to collect and analyse studies on the development of basic human values in childhood and early adolescence that published from 2008 to 2021. A systematic search of the literature was undertaken using three electronic databases (PsycINFO, Web of Science and Scopus). Reviewers independently conducted the screening procedures to identify all papers focusing on basic human values in childhood and early adolescence (5 to 14 years-old), according to a set of previously defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The articles were submitted to a standardised quality appraisal assessment tool to determine their methodological soundness. The retrieved data was extracted and summarised using a narrative synthesis approach that reports studies’ characteristics, socio-demographic variables, evidence on value structure, value preferences, factors associated with values and measures used to assess values in children and adolescents. A total of 44 papers were included in this review. The evidence provides extensive support to Schwartz's theoretical model. Moreover, several factors concerning predictors, moderators, mediators, correlates and outcomes of values were identified, and a total of 6 different instruments that allow measuring valu

Design/methodology/approach: Participant observation was carried out in a surplus food redistribution charity, a soup kitchen and a social supermarket, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with supervisors of these FAIs. The study followed an inductive coding strategy, and a thematic analysis was developed. Findings: The main results point to an appreciation of the initiatives and the role they play, but they also highlight the existence of several challenges, mainly related to: 1) difficulties in accessing sources of funding, 2) the absence of an intervening state and 3) a scarcity of resources that allow a thorough assessment of their activities and services provided, which weakens the public image of these responses. Originality/value: The development of food assistance in Europe has a long history. Over the past few years, this sector has grown significantly. Nowadays, it is possible to identify several realities around emergency food provision. However, this heterogeneity has not been sufficiently explored in the literature. In addition, there are few studies that report on the variety of initiatives that coexist in Portugal and establish a comparison between them.

The latter's historicist exegesis of gracia points to basic aspects of human experience that are also salient in the reduction to basics that Davidson carried out concerning interpretation and truth. For Davidson, in the face of ultimate indeterminacy, interpretation is made possible due to the rational accommodation that charity sparks off. For Pitt-Rivers, gratuity highlights how processes of personal interaction depend on the drawing of shared trajectories: that is, not only do I have to grant others charity in order to make sense of them, I also have to frame others as subjects with a future by relation to myself as already in existence.

Bearing in mind its focus on place-based development strategies, this paper intends to shed some light on its appropriateness to tackle uneven development and regional growth divergence. The paper showcases Spanish Extremadura growth trajectory. Extremadura is a poor region in the European context that between 2008 and 2014 diverged from the EU average, despite being eligible for EU funding as a convergence region by cohesion policy. In the 2014–2020 programming period, there was a positive dynamic at the beginning, but from 2017 onwards convergence stopped, which indicates that thematic and regional programmes have not delivered results or have not compensated for higher growth level of other Spanish regions. Moreover, research and innovation strategies for smart specialization (RIS3) seem to have limited impacts on place-based economic transformation in less developed regions. From this example, the suitability of the smart specialisation strategy as the core of cohesion policy in the programming period is discussed. It concludes that this strategy is interesting for intermediate development regions with some industrial base but does not seem appropriate as a convergence driver for poorer regions.","[0.03550254, 0.0, 0.00735642, 0.01712026, 0.00232845, 0.0, 0.02040976, 0.0, 0.01018266, 0.01023149, 0.00388983, 0.04504179]",politics,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Information about consumers’ food safety perception, knowledge and practices in the domestic environment is lacking in order to define the main intervention opportunities to obtain a significant reduction in the occurrence of foodborne salmonellosis. We conducted an on-line survey of the Portuguese population on self-reported domestic egg handling and occurrence of illness from egg consumption, which were analysed in a Critical Consumer Handling (CCH) framework. Respondents (N = 927) reported behaviours associated with high risk of Salmonella infection, namely the frequent consumption of eggs from non-controlled sources (43%) and of dishes prepared with uncooked or lightly cooked eggs. Other risk related practices, from egg storage until consumption, were also found to be common. However, when buying eggs respondents value safety-related criteria above others – use-by date (highly valued by 72.8%), lack of cracks (72.2%) and cleanliness (48%). Association of eggs with Salmonella contamination was recognized by 65.8% of the respondents; 72.2% declared to have never been sick after eating eggs. In addition to global egg safety awareness messages, future campaigns should prioritize shifting consumers towards eggs with low probability of being contaminated and encouraging the use of pasteurized eggs, in particular when used in recipes that are not fully heat treated. The importance of storing backyards eggs at refrigeration temperature needs to be communicated.","[8.90897168e-05, 0.0248224322, 0.00161177466, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.038899123, 0.0, 0.0831380055, 0.00504310385, 0.0, 0.0]",economy,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06

What is the educational value of such experience? How does aesthetic experience prompt meaning making? Our presentation addresses these questions. The presentation consists of two parts. Our particular interest rests in the relation between aesthetic experience and its capacity for meaning making. Thus in the first part we address some current literature linked to our focus. This discussion provides a theoretical framework for the second part. One challenge to aesthetic education is to be able to demonstrate that, within encounters with artworks, some form of learning is taking place. We maintain that the amassing of historical or technical information is not the primary benefit of aesthetic encounters. What then is the particular nature of aesthetic learning? Some research suggests that aesthetic encounters complement and help articulate earlier experiences. This counts as learning because it provides us with greater understanding of that to which we have been previously introduced. In the second part of our presentation we present examples of just such learning. Other research suggests that, because aesthetic encounters require a reciprocal interaction between viewer and the object or event experienced, the interaction is a form of dialogue in which one comes to empathize with the other while at the same time gaining increased self-understanding. Our study also supports this thesis. In the second part of our presentation we provide examples of how such learning takes place.

First, it analyses the many changes in, and responses to, the operation of “the state” wrought by the First World War and the calamities that followed. In this period, the classic questions surrounding the relationship between law, order and liberty took on new meaning and inspired new ideas. Some of the more ambitious—even radical—figures suggested rewriting entirely the so-called “rules of the game.” Others sought to re-establish the old order on a more philosophically robust and practically pragmatic footing. These new ideas both followed from, and fostered, new approaches, methods and academic collaborations across the traditional disciplinary, cultural and national borders. For many, these dynamics brought a heightened urgency and a new sense of possibility to the age-old dreams of a united Europe. The chapter closes by reflecting on the work undertaken—and the work left unfinished—by the architects of the post-war European project.","[0.06573199, 0.0, 0.00202908, 0.00608051, 0.00476104, 0.0126251, 0.00185972, 0.00325494, 0.0, 0.0124158, 0.00294586, 0.03544761]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06

This article returns to this classic question, now using time-series, cross-sectional data to test whether the effectiveness of governments in sustaining economic growth, providing quality healthcare, and tackling violent crime affects popular attitudes to democracy. We find that satisfaction with democracy is driven by fluctuations in economic performance and violent crime (but not healthcare quality). Diffuse support for democracy, in contrast, remains relatively impervious to changes in government effectiveness. Violent crime is the only indicator of effectiveness which has an impact on democratic support, and does so indirectly, via its influence on democratic satisfaction. These findings confirm that democratic support—which, unlike democratic satisfaction, is thought to help sustain democracy—is mostly immune to crises of performance.","[0.03093102, 0.0, 0.01084628, 0.00117065, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0256955, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07515514, 0.01641109, 0.0]",criminology,"[4.82137327e-05 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

It is designed to respond to the growing appeal for transformative change, by exploring the often inconvenient and uncomfortable spaces of knowledge production and co-creation that can make such change happen. Combining global trends in theory with experience of local practice, Enabling the City strikes a balance between enthusiastic support for such transformational potential and a cautious note regarding the persistent challenges to the ethos as well as the practice of inter and transdisciplinarity. The rich stories reflect different research and local practice cultures, exploring issues such as wellbeing and ageing, community, health and dementia, public space, energy, mobility cultures, heritage, housing, re-use, and renewal, as well as more universal questions about urban sustainability and climate change, and perhaps most importantly, education and competences. Against this backdrop, aspirations for the 21st century are related to the international, national, and local agendas expressed in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and in the New Urban Agenda (NUA), raising fundamental questions of how to enable development.

Theoretical work and, in particular, comparative empirical research on the quality of local democracy are less advanced. This paper contributes to our understanding of how democracy works from below. It develops a conceptual framing and employs a multidimensional index of the quality of democracy across all 278 municipalities in mainland Portugal by focusing on procedural dimensions of democratic performance at three levels of legitimacy: input, throughput, and output. Regression analysis is then used as a preliminary test of the usefulness of these measures of quality of local democracy and to uncover associations between them and a range of political and socioeconomic factors. The results suggest that municipalities led by independent mayors, with larger populations and higher levels of multiculturalism are likelier to be associated with ‘better’ local democracy.","[0.0528679359, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0631882964, 0.00576195969, 0.0, 0.000431984329, 9.30121527e-05, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Are admissions to intensive care units proportional among white and black people? Are physicians more likely to, unknowingly, pay more attention to white patients and therefore be more likely to offer them life-saving intensive care treatment? This study examined whether white Portuguese medical students' reaction to patients is affected by patients' race in a scenario of limited medical resources. Using an experimental paradigm, the authors asked whether exposure to objects associated with intensive care (vs. neutral objects) increased the attention of white medical students, and whether such attention to intensive care stimuli increased when preceded by white faces (vs. black faces). The results show that medical students' attention was significantly higher toward intensive care stimuli (vs. neutral stimuli), but that there wasn't a statistically significant difference in their attention to intensive care stimuli when they were primed with a white face vs. a black face. The paradigm was successful in capturing selective attention in a novel context-the covid-19 pandemic-suggesting that it can be used in future studies as a tool for examining attentional processes in medical research.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.03912608, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05880114, 0.03992115, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.10222725, 0.0]",community_service,"[1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

The economic, social and environmental consequences have been discussed by climate organizations and activists. The emergence of political changes linked to environmental issues has fueled protests around the world because there are many discussions and few concrete results. The aim of this study is to analyze linguistically-discursively the power relations in the speech of environmental activist Greta Thunberg and what Sociology of the Environment has discussed regarding the participation of society in environmental protection policies. The climate change activist's speeches are selected from the internet. Discourse analysis is used under the theory of Perelman (2005) considering argumentation as a form of persuasion and Foucault (1999) about discourse and power. The analysis by Dunlap (2015) and Okereke (2018) follows, following the stream of Chateauraunaud's pragmatic sociology (2005). The results show that there is a prevalence of a persuasive discourse aimed at the climate crisis, in an attempt to highlight the emergencies and the strength of the new generation for political movements. It is concluded that public policies are guided by concrete actions based on social movements, not only in terms of social movements based on environmental awareness, but also on the demands of the next generation and forms of power through discourse.","[0.08219161, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.09569333, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

While our authors may sometimes focus on different dependent variables, they all speak to the question of whether the Great Recession made a lasting difference, and whether EU politicisation matters. Most articles are longitudinal, and test for changes due to the crisis (Dassonneville, Lewis- Beck and Jabbour; Ruiz-Rufino; Talving and Vasilopolou; Jurado and Navarrete). But preoccupation with the Great Recession is also present in the articles assessing the political learning that unfolded from it (Ruiz-Rufino), or the ones which investigate whether EU effects can be detected during the post-crisis years (Talving and Vasilopolou; Lobo and Pannico; Heyne and Lobo). Despite the diversity of approaches, and certain differences in findings, each article contributes to a major debate ongoing in the literature, especially three key debates which have arisen: the crisis’ impact on European party systems, economic voting, and the degree of legitimacy of democratic systems.","[0.05802109, 0.0, 0.03328482, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00843152, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00625571, 0.0, 0.03636241]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06

In the first part, I review dominant (Western/liberal) logics of security and the main strands of critical security studies to argue for the need to: overcome the liberal framework of the balance among rights and freedom, with its inherent imbrication with the fantasy of absolute security; and, contra the ultimate conclusions of deconstructive critique, to take the desire for security seriously at the same time. By advocating for embracing the tensions that surface at this intersection, I then move to my reconstructive endeavor. I set out a meta-theory with both analytical and normative nature, agonistic security, inspired by the political theory developed by Mouffe and Laclau. Building on the opposition between antagonism and agonism, I argue that security belongs to the “political”, and that it constitutes a field of struggle for politicization. I then argue for three conceptual shifts, which concretely define agonistic security: i) from an absolute/static to a relational/dynamic understanding of security; ii) from universalism to pluralism at a world scale; and iii) from the dominance of individual rights in Western/liberal thinking toward security as a collective endeavor.

We adopt a multi-scalar approach to exploring security discourse/practice, comparing the performativity of national and global security with the local practice/discourse of public safety—with empirical focus on the case of Memphis (TN). Our main arguments are that the homeland builds on the same performative elements of the emergence and consolidation of a certain conception of “community”, as it has become dominant in public safety policymaking at the local scale; and that the homeland/community performativity is the expression of a never-ending movement of production of multi-scalar geographies of the “good” and “evil”, made of the coexistence of centrifugal (pushing problems away) and centripetal (incorporating any given outside) dimensions.","[0.05512445, 0.00112217, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00974921, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02507697, 0.01369134, 0.01130917, 0.00896687]",politics,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

To do this, the report portrays indicators of: youth population; youth em- ployment and unemployment; education; and, NEETs distribution. The characterisation of all indicators adopts the degree of urbanisation as a central criterion, thereby enabling propor- tional comparisons between rural areas, towns and suburbs, cities and the whole country. These analyses are further divided into age subgroups and, where possible, into sex groups for greater detail. The statistical procedures adopted across the different selected dimensions involve: des- criptive longitudinal analysis; using graphical displays (e.g., overlay line charts); and, the calculation of proportional absolute and relative changes between 2009 and 2013, 2013 and 2019, and finally 2009 and 2019. These time ranges were chosen to capture the in- dicators evolution before and after the economic crisis which hit European countries. All data was extracted from Eurostat public datasets. The analyses show that between 2009 and 2019 the rural youth population aged 15 to 24 years has been increasing in Portugal. Although the youth unemployment rate is higher in cities, rural areas faced more difficulties in overcoming the effects of the crisis, particularly among young adults aged over 25 years. In the field of education, however, there was an absolute and relative reduction in the proportion of young people with lower qualifications compared with young people in early school leavers in rural areas between 2009-2019, even though it still remains well above the 10% targe

Here, Mussolini’s regime had devised its largest feat of bonifica integrale (“integral cleansing,” or “reclamation”). Fascism’s overall project spanned various areas of “metropolitan” Italy and its overseas territories in Libya and East Africa, and aimed to fulfill the promise of land to peasants—a core element of fascism’s political platform in the aftermath of World War I—without upsetting that landowning elite which had supported the dictatorship’s rise to power. At the same time, these measures worked to quell internal opposition and build international reputation. While the scheme became progressively innervated by partially new ideals of racial purity and unity, it built on previous experiments dating as far back as the late eighteenth century, and would outlive the downfall and formal repudiation of the fascist credo at the end of World War II. The spectral survivals of these interventions on land, property, and people, which have stratified the landscape over the course of more than two centuries, haunt agribusiness enclaves and their migrant workforce today.","[0.03769847, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00245107, 0.00462136, 0.0, 0.000157, 0.00230459, 0.00633292, 0.0375307]",politics,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01

With its devastating impacts yet to be fully determined, the pandemic’s anthropogenic origins, reach, public, and political response are a stark reminder of the challenges the implementation of the UN Agenda 2030 and its 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) will face. At first, the urgency and immediacy of the Covid-19 crisis may fog this comparison. However, a striking resemblance becomes apparent when taking into account the pandemic’s global nature, associated geopolitical strife, scrambled initial institutional action, dynamic of (mis)information flows, and uneven geographical and socioeconomic implications. Concerning knowledge, a clear dichotomy emerged during Covid-19. On the one hand, a collaborative race for solutions began in terms of treatment, containment, and prevention. From epidemiologists, physicians to social psychologists, from local nurses to the World Health Organization, from national heads of state to mayors and civil society, Covid-19 mobilized joint working at different levels, sectors, and between a widely diverse array of actors. On the other hand, it also illustrated the speed in which fake facts spread in the age of post-truth. This highlighted the dangers of knowledge politicization, with its use primarily tuned for political combat rather than socially beneficial purposes. Multiple lessons can be taken from the outset of the pandemic to inform the implementation of the UN Agenda 2030 and the SDGs: the need to reorganize political priorities in face of a perceived emergency and to work collaboratively at multiple levels, as well as the relevance of an adequate knowledge governance framework.","[0.05701865, 0.0, 0.1646591, 0.0, 0.02398188, 0.00192453, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",covid,"[9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

Being in company involves an intersubjective engagement that has implications not only for what we do, but also for who we are, and where we are. Company involves more than simply one person interacting with another; it necessarily engages more than two persons inhabiting a common space. As persons emerge into personhood always within company, they necessarily experience the presence of third parties as a possible threat, inevitably giving rise to contradictory emotions. That is why company moves us emotionally and transcendentally, why it produces mysterious effects.

It seeks to identify the format and content of images used to illustrate online information about the pandemic, in particular, from websites of policy institutions, research promoters, and media in Portugal and Spain. By examining a sample containing 600 images, it aims to identify the messages being conveyed and the effects these images intend to provoke and to illuminate the differences in representations among the three sources of communication. Differences and similarities with visual images of previous pandemics (influenza, AIDS) are examined. This article ascertains that policy websites aim to be mostly prescriptive, relying on infographics to convey prevention and care instructions to its audiences. On the other hand, science websites rely mostly on stock photos and images from scientific articles to illustrate current research, while newspaper websites are the most diversified in terms of the images they use and the topics they cover. This study concludes that representations of science are still very much based on stereotypical imagery of labs and white coats, that representations of the medical side of the pandemic are focused on images of intensive care that aim to generate fear and stimulate responsible behavior, and that the social aspects of the pandemic are illustrated by images that focus either on pandemic prevention (e.g., washing hands) or on the impacts of the pandemic itself (e.g., empty streets during lockdown).","[0.0135956302, 0.0, 0.159538109, 0.00812432396, 0.000109249953, 0.017958913, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00289495258, 0.00606959736, 0.0172058739, 0.0]",covid,"[1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01

This article aims to contribute to this field of study through the specific lens of the city of Lisbon’s experience as an internationally acknowledged leader in participatory budgeting. To this end, the article critically examines the lessons and potential contribution of the Lisbon Participatory Budget through a multimethod approach. Emerging trends and variations of citizen proposals, projects, votes, and public funding are analysed in tandem with emerging key topics that show links and trade-offs between locally embedded participation and the international discourse on urban sustainability. Our analysis reveals three interconnected findings: first, the achievements of the Lisbon Participatory Budget show the potential to counteract the dominant engineered approach to urban sustainability; second, trends and variations of the achievements depend on both citizens’ voice and the significant influence of the city council through policymaking; and, third, the shift towards a thematic Green Participatory Budget in 2020 was not driven by consolidated social and political awareness on the achievements, suggesting that more could be achieved through the 2021 urban sustainability oriented Participatory Budget. We conclude recommending that this kind of analysis should be systematically carried out and disseminated within city council departments, promoting much needed internal awareness of PBs’ potential as drivers of urban sustainability.

I examine the ways in which practitioners inscribe their expert knowledge on their patients’ bodies, stigmatizing the marks of time and proposing medical treatments and surgeries to “repair” and “correct” them. Beauty and youth are symbolically constructed in medical discourse as visual markers of health, an adequate lifestyle, a strong character and good personal choices (such as not smoking, and a healthy diet and exercise habits). What beauty means within the discourse of anti-aging and therapeutic rejuvenation is increasingly connected to an ideal gender performance of normative, white, middle-class, heterosexual femininity that dismisses structural determinants. The fantasy of eternal youth, linked to a neoliberal ideology of limitless enhancement and individual responsibility, is firmly entrenched in moralizing definitions of aesthetics and gender norms. Finally, my article highlights the ways in which the women I interviewed do not always passively accept the discourse of the devaluation of the ageing body, defining femininity and ageing in their own terms by creating personal variants of the hegemonic normative discourses on beauty and successful ageing.","[0.00792201, 0.02817808, 0.0016285, 0.08895115, 0.0, 0.01264026, 0.0274427, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0219099, 0.0]",women,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

These indicators are individual pledges and climate-related policies; approaches to climate finance; and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC). The analysis first shows how the US started eroding the broader LIO and the climate change regime to then delve into the behaviours of the three respective key players concerning climate talks. I sustain that the EU, despite its inner divisions, is already counteracting Washington, whereas China is combining a pro-status quo position based on a rhetorical condemnation of the United States.

Accordingly, this paper approaches freshness as a matter of concern. Drawing on extensive fieldwork across sites of food production and consumption in the UK and Portugal, we identify four enactments of freshness. The analysis zooms in on the specific case of plastic food packaging and uses these enactments to consider a series of questions about realities and the relationships between them. Since packaging is an issue that readily overflows to encompass a broader suite of propositions about food, we argue that freshness is a suitable focus around which to assemble hybrid forums to debate future possibilities. Joining a body of recent work that brings relational-materialist sensibilities to bear on sustainability governance, we demonstrate that these ideas are not exhausted by a concern with the ways in which existing ontologies are brought together in policy. To conclude, we suggest that attention to the multiple ontologies of qualities complements and extends approaches that focus on objects by offering a conduit that brings understandings of markets into discussions of ontological politics.","[0.0325385, 0.00387605, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.23564449, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",economy,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01

In this article, we argue that another concept, that of articulation developed by Laclau and Mouffe, is particularly adequate to help gentrification, touristification and financialisation to travel among places and levels of abstraction. In order to make this argument, we focus on Southern Europe, whose cities had long been considered scarcely gentrifiable and where, more recently, critical urban scholarship has made large use ogf gentrification, touristification and financialisation to 3 explain the impacts of crisis, austerity, and afterwards economic rebound driven by real estate and tourism. We explore in multi-scalar perspective the trajectory of Mouraria, a historical neighbourhood in Lisbon-and particularly the dimensions of housing and local politics. We show how Mouraria, during the last decade, shifted from being a 'deviant' case-capable of taking advantage of neoliberal regeneration policies in order to keep its social diversity and most of its long-term residents-toward one 'paradigmatic' of urbanisation-as-accumulation and contentious urban politics. We explain this shift by focusing on its multi-scalar determinants; concluding that present urban change in many Southern European cities should be understood as the articulation of various processes, which include gentrification, touristification and financialisation.","[0.06328813, 0.0, 0.00940387, 0.00784814, 0.00454111, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00787014, 0.00215893, 0.0, 0.01521744]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Our analysis stems from an historical overview at two scales, regional and municipal, within the Lisbon Region. Specifically, we identify key changes between two time-periods: the mid- twentieth century, when design-based planning was established in Portugal for larger settlements, and nowadays, when it covers the totality of the national territory, based on land-use. We review these strategies, assessing what approaches would best encompass a sustainable transition of the food system. We start with the scheme of regional radial axis by architect Étienne de Gröer in contrast with the 2002 Lisbon Regional Plan. We furthermore expose two urbanization plans from 1940s: that of Vila Franca de Xira (1946) by Miguel Jacobetty and Faria da Costa and that of Palmela (1948) by João António Aguiar. Such plans, highly representative of the planning practices of that era, are then compared with their contemporary counterparts and subsequently with samples of their physical impacts on the ground, based on a morphological analysis of settlements and productive spaces in urban and rural contexts.

Rural contexts close to urban areas are assumed to have informal support networks that can alleviate poverty and exclusion when institutional support fails. The incidence and intensity of food poverty are presumed to be lessened by proximity to food production sites and land ownership. In this paper, we aim to analyse how living in an intermediate area shapes the experience of food poverty. We draw on qualitative case studies of low‐income families living in between a predominantly rural and a predominantly urban territory in Portugal, which has been through a process of restructuring of its rural territory since the second half of the 20th century. Paying attention to the specificities of this intermediate context, including the availability of formal support, we will investigate to what extent informal support networks alleviate food poverty for these families. Our discussion adds to the scientific debate on food poverty and its links to social networks in intermediate areas previously embedded in predominantly rural territories.

Such dynamics are shown to interact in complex ways with specific migration routes and their control, which also bear the effects of an encroaching logistical rationality. At times, these feed into the demand for cheap, just-in-time labour in agribusiness, whilst at others they clash with the needs of this sector. Racialisation represents a crucial tool of containment, together with a sexualised division of labour.

While applying an analytical framework based on environmental justice, we perform a cross-analysis of the city-wide greening strategies, together with a peculiar and unusual planning process for a new green space in the neighbourhood of Marvila. Based on qualitative research carried out in-situ, we argue that Lisbon’s greening strategies are based on a discourse of ecological benefits, without aiming to ensure access to green space for different population groups. Procedural justice concerns are widely undervalued, resulting in limited space available for community involvement. We show how urban greening is essentially a multiscalar exercise, impacted by and affecting multiple scales simultaneously. Hence procedural justice deserves a much more prominent role in urban greening, as participation and recognition can give local communities the opportunity to adapt global urban agendas toward their particular needs and desires. Our findings lead us to conclude that environmental justice is ultimately an exercise of multiscalar governance, where local decision-making needs to attend to contextual challenges but also to a long-term sustainability vision at a larger scale.","[0.03409475, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00374555, 0.15932814, 0.0, 0.00298486, 0.0, 0.00825271, 0.00499209, 0.02402893, 0.0]",politics,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

In an attempt to document the implications of this demographic transition, the Journal of Cities & Health in collaboration with the International Society for Urban Health (ISUH) launched a special issue. This special issue is composed of seven original research papers and one commentary that present a fair geographical coverage of urban Asia. This scholarship aims to: 1) enhance the state-of-the-art understanding of health risks, social vulnerability and adaptation policies in cities across Asia; 2) present case studies where local contexts were taken into consideration to respond to local health needs and cultural preferences; 3) highlight new evidence of health risks and the impact of the built environment; and 4) examine the use of emerging digital technologies and big data across diverse sectors for a more sustainable urban living environment. In the current context of COVID-19, new challenges, insights, and opportunities for change have arisen. Specifically, some crowded Asian cities offer successful approaches in battling early outbreaks of COVID-19 and provide a model for keeping the pandemic at bay, even if they can’t completely eliminate infections. Asian cities can make changes to design spatially distanced transport and recreation opportunities and the long-term implications for both infectious and chronic diseases.

Contaminated chicken is the food vehicle associated with the majority of reported cases of campylobacteriosis, either by the consumption of undercooked meat or via cross- contamination of ready-to-eat (RTE) foods during the handling of contaminated raw chicken parts and carcasses. Our results indicate that cooking salt (used for seasoning) is a potential vehicle for Campylobacter spp. cross-contamination from raw chicken to lettuce, through unwashed hands after handling contaminated chicken. Cross-contamination events were observed even when the chicken skin was contaminated with low levels of Campylobacter spp. (ca. 1.48 Log CFU/g). The pathogen was recovered from seasoned lettuce samples when raw chicken was contaminated with levels ≥ 2.34 Log CFU/g. We also demonstrated that, once introduced into cooking salt, Campylobacter spp. are able to survive in a culturable state up to 4 hours. After six hours, although not detected following an enrichment period in culture medium, intact cells were observed by transmission electron microscopy. These findings reveal a “novel” indirect cross-contamination route of Campylobacter in domestic settings, and a putative contamination source to RTE foods that are seasoned with salt, that might occur if basic food hygiene practices are not adopted by consumers when preparing and cooking poultry dishes.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.00085696, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00020216, 0.01822438, 0.0, 0.13652977, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00257831]",economy,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

The fact that the political legitimacy of the Portuguese regime was not dependent on sanctioning by the Holy See justifies this apparent inconsistency. The distinctive features of the Portuguese concordat were enhanced by the authoritarian, rather than totalitarian, nature of the regime. Salazar, more so than Mussolini or Franco, was constrained by political forces not in favour of Catholic privileges. In addition, the dictator himself defended a strict separation of church and state as prescribed by the Portuguese constitution.

Findings 21,027 mothers were included in the analysis. Among those who experienced labour (N=18,063), 41·8% (26·1%- 63·5%) experienced difficulties in accessing antenatal care, 62% (12·6%-99·0%) were not allowed a companion of choice, 31·1% (16·5%-56·9%) received inadequate breastfeeding support, 34·4% (5·2%-64·8%) reported that health workers were not always using protective personal equipment, and 31·8% (17·8%-53·1%) rated the health workers’ number as “insufficient”. Episiotomy was performed in 20·1% (6·1%-66·0%) of spontaneous vaginal births and fundal pressure applied in 41·2% (11·5% -100%) of instrumental vaginal births.

Nonetheless, during electoral campaigns, the use of this medium poses both challenges and advantages for the institutional communication made by political parties and candidates. An often-overlooked advantage is the possibility, particularly on social media, for parties and candidates to bypass journalists and communicate directly to a large and varied audience. This aspect is particularly relevant since the literature has been noting, in the last decades, a decline in the salience of substantive political information in the mainstream news coverage of political events. By comparing the political actors’ campaigns on social media with press news coverage of those campaigns, this chapter examines the role and impact of the Internet on modern political communication. An extensive content analysis of four electoral campaigns in four different countries (United States, Italy, Brazil, and Portugal) shows that candidates’ and parties’ online campaigns, compared to news articles in the press, tend to be more frequently framed in terms of substantive political issues. Even though there are differences between political actors and the social media platforms used (Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube), the results suggest that, overall, candidates and parties do actually try to convey substantive political information when communicating directly to the electorate. Furthermore, compared to articles in the press, social media campaigns also tend to be less frequently framed in terms of conflict, political scandals, and strategy aspects.","[0.09031027, 0.0, 0.02458916, 0.01845315, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00149526, 0.0, 0.0]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

This situation has considerable implications for families, frequently called upon to provide caring tasks. Portugal may be considered as having followed a specific pathway regarding the reconciliation of work and family life. On the one hand, norms emphasize a strong full-time work ethic, for both men and women and growing state support for families and care services; on the other hand, stress is laid on strong family obligations to care. In this paper we analyze the strategies of families in the context of this cultural double bind, whilst caring for dependent elderly parents. Qualitative interviews were carried out with adult children working full time and caring for a parent. Adopting a work-life balance perspective, we address the diversity of care arrangements identified, carers' perceptions of the main difficulties and pressures experienced, as well as the support they can rely upon in order to deal with the situation. The conclusion stress how the plurality of care arrangements is leading to a move away from a familistic care regime towards a more mixed care regime, combining both family care and formal paid services in diverse and complex ways.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.03231582, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07974811, 0.00941902, 0.0, 0.2271595, 0.0]",community_service,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 2.45946110e-06 9.99999000e-01

Key to this is activating and increasing citizen participation in a fractal-like, multi scaled, community-led, bottom up planning process, where active citizens design, construct and are part of the futures they desire for their territories. 2019’s declarations of climate emergency show that decades of sustainable development have not worked. The Sustainable Development Goals are a positive step, but sustainability’s dependence on economic growth is problematic. Recognising Earth’s limits, this article builds on degrowth ideas and doughnut economic frameworks to examine the role of community-led urban transitions in catalysing a regenerative world, where ecocities are the normative goal of contemporary cities. Challenges in scaling the Global Ecovillage Network’s process to large cities are identified and some radical governance experiments examined. Attempting to bridge activism and academia, a transdisciplinary participative action research method is used to develop a Communities of Practice ecosystem to support an eco-social just transition. This work contributes to the European Network for Community-Led Initiatives on Climate Change and Sustainability, ECOLISE, the Horizon 2020 project UrbanA investigating Sustainable and Just Cities, and the Communities for Future action platform enabling translocal communities to connect, co-create a knowledge commons and help shape policy.

We argue that the speed and scale of the crisis are indeed distinctive, but that claims of symmetry—a crisis affecting all equally—are misplaced. We suggest that stimulus packages have, in broad terms, reflected the scale of the threat and that the wage subsidies and employment supports that were introduced or adjusted are novel in scope and scale, with innovative developments. There has been a greater emphasis on housing than was apparent in responses to the Great Recession and, while a focus on taxation in response packages has been a focus in both crises, its form differs, with a greater reliance on deferrals rather than tax reductions in the stimulus plans announced to date. Our account stresses the agility of crisis responses and this agility must be regarded as welcome, mitigating a great deal of social harm during the initial phase of the pandemic. Whether these short‐run responses create pressures for wider‐ranging change is much debated, but highly uncertain.","[0.02296693, 0.0, 0.09636639, 0.0, 0.02146342, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01725334, 0.0, 0.0]",covid,"[5.13353574e-05 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Using data from 27 European countries (N=47,086), we conducted multilevel analyses and found that BJW positively predicted the legitimation of economic inequality, measured by three indicators: the perceived fairness of the overall wealth inequality, and the fairness of the earnings made by the Top 10% and the Bottom 10% of society. These results persisted after controlling for individual- and country-level variables. Moreover, the BJW effect was stronger on the legitimation of the Bottom 10% incomes, compared to the legitimation of the Top 10%.

Specifically, we argue that, under unstable social structure conditions, SDO serves as an ideological justification for collective action tendencies aimed at competing for a higher status. In such context, SDO should be positively related with actions aimed to favor the ingroup (i.e., collective actions) by increasing group members' motivation to engage in direct competition with a relevant higher-status outgroup. We conducted two studies under highly competitive and unstable social structure contexts using real life groups. In Study 1 (N = 77), we induced Low vs. High Ingroup (University) Status and in Study 2 (N = 220) we used competing sports groups. Overall, results showed that, among members of low-status groups, SDO consistently increased individuals' motivation to get involved in actions favoring the ingroup, by boosting their motivation to compete with the opposing high-status outgroup.

When looking at the authoritarian wave of the 1930s, it is not difficult to see how some regimes appeared to offer an authoritarian third way some- where between democracy and fascism. It is in this context that some Iberian dictatorships, such as those of Primo de Rivera in Spain, Salazar’s New State in Portugal, and the short-lived Dollfuss regime in Austria, are mentioned frequently. Especially during the 1930s, and in those parts of Europe under Axis control, these models were discussed and often adopted by several dic- tatorships. This book considers how and why these dictatorships on the periphery of Europe, especially Salazar’s New State in Portugal, inspired some of these regimes’ new political institutions particularly within Europe and Latin America. It pays special attention to how, as they proposed and pursued these authoritarian reforms, these domestic political actors also looked at these institutional models as suitable for their own countries.","[0.09020509, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00127523]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 2.53409354e-06 1.00000000e-06

Inspired by the work of Donald Davidson, I argue that indeterminacy and underdetermination are conditions for all communication and that, in light of that, a position of metaphysical pluralism provides us with a better account of the conditions of possibility of the ethnographic gesture than the kind of ontological pluralism that Swift espouses. I thank Philip Swift for his learned paper, as well as the editors of HAU, both of whom have generously granted me this opportunity to debate the epistemological bases of the conditions of possibility of the ethnographic gesture. I embarked upon this project in the 1990s and it remains an ongoing task; World (2017) turned out to be merely the first relay station on that voyage. 1 Some might argue that Swift's preference for a stress on failure to communicate and my preference for a stress on the possibility of communication are a matter of a glass half full or a glass half empty. After all, he comes to agree with me that 'worlds are not cosmic capsules, self-contained and sealed off from each other.' Very well then, so if that is the case, what are the conditions of possibility of that communicability which makes ethnography possible? This is what I have aimed to investigate, and that is why I am so disturbed by the focus on linguistic and cultural incommunicability that permeated our discipline at the turn of the twentieth century.","[0.04167849, 0.0006009, 0.00892342, 0.0, 0.00947256, 0.00659689, 0.0, 0.00134945, 0.00020232, 0.0, 0.00518127, 0.00463804]",politics,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Partnerships between private and public agencies have sought, accordingly, the engagement of citizens and stakeholders to push forward context-specific interventions. From the participatory action research developed in Lisbon, one of the cities funded under the EU-funded project ROCK, we analyse the ways in which this project has tackled spatial divides and socioeconomic inequalities in the project demonstration area. Our main argument is that operational decisions and substantive mismatches have given rise to opportunities and bottlenecks throughout the implementation of the project. While the public investment has been directed to regenerate a deprived area, it has fallen short of promoting greater connections within the area and with the surrounding neighbourhoods. ROCK’s actions have only partially met local community expectations regarding the project’s objectives for the optimisation of tangible and intangible cultural heritage, with impacts over degrees of citizen engagement in the local Living Lab.","[0.0415252, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01284406, 0.00774428, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01142329, 0.07504066, 0.01388061]",community_service,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

The Greek parliament, a relatively under-researched institution, is an interesting case in this volume’s context for at least two reasons. First, because of how the country’s institutional and party system intricacies do not allow for a straightforward classification along the Proksch and Slapin scheme, placing it somewhere between the two extremes. Second, because of the severe restructuring of the party system during the previous decade as a result of the Eurozone crisis and how it could have potentially strengthened the parliament. We make use of an original dataset on parliamentary speechmaking in the Greek parliament spanning twenty years of plenary debates to try to identify the determinants of floor access.

From a literary corpus compilation, 262 excerpts from 68 works that made reference to wolves were classified by grid analysis into 12 categories, encompassing the diversity of meanings attributed to these animals. Among wild carnivores, the wolf appears most frequently in the literary corpus analyzed. Most references concern conflict and economic losses caused by wolves’ attacks, relating to a utilitarian view of the wild prevalent in rural communities. Nonetheless numerous excerpts reveal closeness with humans and the existence of an ecological knowledge. Writings from the early twentieth century express admiration for wolves and acknowledge their right to exist. Some focus on practices like organized hunts, bounties, or domestication attempts. The negative views depict the wolf as a scapegoat for the shortcomings of rural life. The human desire to control the wolf represents the conquest of the wild. The wolf in literature is the object of further symbolic attributions, associated with witchcraft, religion, specific beliefs and lore but also with freedom and the dark inner self of humans. Overall these mixed views express ambivalent feelings toward the species. The results of this case study demonstrate that humans have multiple views of wolves, views that are not necessarily polarized into negative or positive extremes but that coexist: the vermin and the noble beast. In rural communities the wolf is not viewed as a fragile animal needing protection or as a modern symbol of wilderness.

By contrasting creditor and debtor countries, the article analyses how the Eurozone crisis affected the politicisation of the EU and its institutions using a unique dataset of 165,341 articles from 12 newspapers. The results show that the Eurozone crisis increased the politicisation of the EU, particularly in the countries that were at the forefront of the Eurozone bailouts. Importantly, the crisis contributed as well to a more multifaceted news coverage of the European Union, namely with a greater emphasis given to supranational institutions vis-à-vis intergovernmental ones. Yet, this supranational coverage was associated with the increasingly negative tone of articles. To that extent, this study shows that greater mention of EU institutions may not necessarily contribute to a Europeanisation of public debates.

Although the causes of these developments are complex and multifaceted, here we focus on one factor: the extent to which citizens express materialist and post-materialist concerns. We explore whether objective higher levels of democracy are differentially associated with materialist and post-materialist concerns and, in turn, whether this is related to the wish for a strong leader. Testing this hypothesis across 27 countries (n = 5,741), demonstrated a direct negative effect of democracies’ development on the wish for a strong leader. Further, multi-level mediation analysis showed that the relation between the Democracy Index and the wish for a strong leader was mediated by materialist concerns. This pattern of results suggests that lower levels of democracy are associated with enhanced concerns about basic needs and this is linked to greater support for strong leaders.","[0.0334868, 0.0, 0.01317299, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05244352, 0.00314613, 0.0, 0.00312224, 0.0, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[5.75061632e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Qualitative focus groups and interviews were conducted in rural and city regions across England, France, Hungary and Portugal. Data were collected to attain data saturation, transcribed, thematically analysed, and mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework. Twenty-five out of 84 schools approached (29.8%) participated, with data collected from 156 11–18-year-old students. Students had good knowledge of personal hygiene but did not always follow hygiene rules due to forgetfulness, lack of facilities or lack of concern for consequences. Students had limited understanding of foodborne microbes, underestimated the risks and consequences of foodborne illness and perceived the “home” environment as the safest. Young people preferred interactive educational methods. Addressing gaps in young people’s food safety knowledge is essential to improve their lack of concern towards foodborne illness and motivate them to follow food hygiene and safety behaviours consistently.

For instance, we would expect to see that younger persons that live in the city centre of Lisbon are motivated by ethical considerations related to sustainability than the mother of a numerous family in the economically deprived area of Amadora, who might rather be motivated by monetary or convenience factors.

Background This study draws on a multidimensional approach to attitudinal change in DLF and in the division of parental involvement after divorce/separation. Empirically, it benefits from new measures on fatherhood and motherhood and population‐based data. Method The authors draw on the 2012 Portuguese ISSP module by focusing on three dimensions: types of children's residence; men's involvement in parenting and homemaking; and women's employment and primacy as caregivers. They examine the interplay between attitudinal, family, and sociodemographic variables through regression, multiple correspondence, and cluster analyzes. Results The attitudes to DLF strongly shape the attitudes toward the type of children's residence, which contribute to polarization between preferences for sole residence and shared residence. Also, three attitudinal profiles—unilateral egalitarian familism, egalitarian familism, and mother‐centered familism—revealed attitudinal hybridization through the complex combination of egalitarianism, essentialism and familism, and their embeddedness in social contexts. Conclusion By moving beyond the nuclear family and by combining standard and innovative attitudinal indicators of DLF, the findings shed light on the social processes that are creating complexity and plurality in the attitudes toward cultural models of motherhood and fatherhood.","[0.00996665, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05179999, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01555052, 0.09163027, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00822782, 0.0]",child_family,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Both biological and cultural racism predict opposition to immigration and adhesion to ethnicist criteria on the selection of immigrants. As hypothesised, the relationship between racism and opposition to immigration and adhesion to ethnicist criteria is mediated by threat perceptions. Specifically, symbolic and realistic threats mediate the effect of biological and cultural racism on opposition to immigration and on ethnicist criteria. The hypothesis that the mediation effects are moderated by the country’s quality of democracy was supported, indicating that the mediation effects are stronger in countries with a higher quality of democracy.

This paper analyses the effects of resettlement on the vulnerability of relocated rural communities in Mozambique, from the perspective of environmental justice. The research seeks to understand how land concessions interfere with autonomous processes of adaptation that are not recognised within land distribution policies. The findings draw on a qualitative field research in two locations, in the provinces of Nampula and Cabo Delgado, where levels of poverty have persisted despite national trends of economic growth. The paper highlights how climate events inflluence perceptions of fairness amongst resettled populations, and how resettlements constrain their adaptative capabilities. The findings raise concern that misrecognition of adaptation practices can exacerbate the vulnerability of households to environmental change and to food insecurity, thereby hindering the fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG1 (No Poverty), SDG10 (Reduced Inequalities) and SDG13 (Climate Action).

These are some of the questions that underlie a qualitative research project carried out in Portugal on heavily tattooed young people. In this article, the author discusses their embodied trajectory from the first experiences to their involvement in a body project, and explains the meanings involved in this extreme corporeality. The analysis takes into consideration the structural dynamics that define how young people live their transitions and their identity construction nowadays to contextualize what appears as individual experiences and projects without reifying the individual as a privileged site of knowledge. Based on in-deph comprehensive interviews, the author demonstrates that the engagement of young people in this permanent body modification project represents an embodied struggle for the maintenance of a desired subjectivity. In an increasingly liquid and uncertain society, some young people ink larges extensions of their bodies searching for social recognition as different, authentic, and autonomous individuals and trying to maintain their core identity during transitional turning points.","[0.00827536, 0.02898765, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01338506, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01267876, 0.0, 0.12785863, 0.00617583]",community_service,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

We focus on two countries with divergent performances in the Eurozone: Germany and Greece, and make use of a novel dataset, which contains all necessary items to test this hypothesis. Our comprehensive vote model shows that in both countries economic voting occurs. However, once we interact perceptions of EU responsibility with perceptions of economic performance, we obtain diverging results: in Germany, the weight of economic perceptions on vote increases when citizens assign a higher responsibility to the EU for the country's economic situation. This is the opposite of what the “blurring of responsibility” posits. On the contrary, Greek electors are in line with expectations of our main hypothesis. Moreover, in this country we also found support for the idea that only citizens with a high level of political sophistication are able to incorporate the distribution of responsibilities for the economic policy in their vote calculus.

First, our findings dispute existing characterisations of the Portuguese case, which fail to distinguish between populist and nationalist claim-making.

The problem is that efforts towards prejudice reduction may serve to suppress genuine efforts to change. We propose the Achieving Multicultural Integration of Groups Across Society (AMIGAS) model, in which a multicultural commitment is proposed as a driver of both improved intergroup evaluations and promotion of collective action for reduced inequality, especially in contexts where there are conditions for a respectful intercultural dialogue.

Predictive policing is, at the same time, one of the drivers of the birth, and the ultimate material enactment of, the anticipatory logics that are central to the smart city discourse. Quite surprisingly, however, critical analyses of the smart city have remained divorced from critical criminology and police studies. To fill this gap, this article sets out the first critical, in-depth empirical discussion of Blue CRUSH, a predictive policing program developed in Memphis (TN, USA), where its implementation intersects long-term austerity for urban policy. The article, first, shows that there is no evidence of Blue CRUSH’s capacity to prevent crime, thus adding empirical material to skepticism over the role of predictive policing as a policy solution in the first place. And, second, it argues that, rather than making crime a matter of technological solutions, predictive policing shifts the politics therein – in short, it contributes to the expansion of policing into the field of urban policy at the same time as it disrupts present police work.

The interest group literature has examined how the use of advocacy tactics, such as lobbying or media campaigns, contributes to an actor’s perceived influence. The policy networks literature, in turn, has found that network ties and occupying certain institutional roles can explain why actors are perceived as influential. When investigating what explains perceptions of influence, interest groups scholars have not accounted for network interdependencies and network scholars have so far not examined the advocacy tactics used by interest groups. This paper addresses the gap at the intersection of these two literatures by investigating the relationship between network ties, institutional roles, advocacy tactics and the presence of influence attribution ties in climate change policy networks. Exponential random graph models are applied to network data collected from the organisations participating in the national climate change policymaking processes in six EU countries that vary by the extent to which they are majoritarian or consensual democracies: Czechia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Portugal, and Sweden. The results show that network ties and institutional roles are better predictors of influence attribution ties than advocacy tactics and that there is no pattern in the relationship between advocacy tactics and influence attribution ties across different institutional contexts. These findings suggest that because influence is primarily associated with structural factors (network ties and institutional roles) that more established policy actors are likely to have more influence, which may inhibit the need for a significant step cha

This study analyses how public support for such exceptional measures are determined by cognitive and ideological factors known to create and maintain racial biases in the criminal system. Participants were asked to express their level of agreement with the early-release of hypothetical prisoners. Results showed participants to be less favourable to the early-release of Black compared to White prisoners, when they had committed a stereotypically Black crime. As expected, the congruency between the crime stereotypicality and the colour of the prisoner’s skin did not emerge for White prisoners. Moreover, the difference between the agreement with the release of the Black vs. the White prisoner when both committed a stereotypically Black crime was higher as the level of endorsement of Meritocracy increased. Contrastingly, Anti-egalitarianism only predicted an overall disagreement with prisoners’ early-release.

Using new online survey data from the Spanish and Portuguese national elections in 2019, we find that the Iberian PRR electorate is mostly in line with the characteristics of the PRR electorate in Western Europe when it comes to socio-demographics, political dissatisfaction, media diet, and the rejection of immigration and feminism. Interestingly, however, the support for Chega and VOX does not come from economic losers of globalization. Finally, both parties capitalize on country-specific issues —national unity in Spain and welfare in Portugal— but PRR parties might struggle to establish themselves within the party system of the two Iberian countries.","[0.05667136, 0.0, 0.00588541, 0.048418, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00388179, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Inner transformation relates to various aspects of human existence and interactions such as consciousness, mindsets, values, worldviews, beliefs, spirituality and human–nature connectedness. The article draws on Meadows’ leverage points approach, as places to intervene in a system, to reveal the relevance of inner transformation for system change towards sustainability. Based on insights from a series of dialogue and reflection workshops and a literature review, this article provides three important contributions to sustainability transformations research: first, it increases our conceptual understanding of inner transformation and its relevance for sustainability; second, it outlines concrete elements of the inner transformation-sustainability nexus in relation to leverage points; and third, it presents practical examples illustrating how to work with leverage points for supporting inner transformation. In sum, the paper develops a systematized and structured approach to understanding inner transformation, including the identification of deep, i.e., highly influential, leverage points. In addition, it critically discusses the often contentious and divergent perspectives on inner transformation and shows related practical challenges.

The children’s narratives expressed concerns for their own safety and that of others, as well as concern for ecological damage. Emotional distress was also reported. The verbal statements accompanying the drawings helped the children to express their narratives carefully, allowing them to become active participants in their own process of thinking about the phenomena. We argue that children’s drawings constitute a valuable methodology to access children’s experiences after a disaster, as their visual richness reaches more than humans worlds.

We focus on the problem of intergenerational overlap of contemporaneity and the contradictions that emerge from it.

Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) is a key component to the overall health and quality of life and is impacted by power inequities inherent to society's institutions, environment, economics, and culture. In Portugal, guidelines for intervention in SRH are insufficient, a gap that is more pronounced with migrant populations due to the absence of culturally sensitive indicators to assess and monitor SRH. The aim of this work was 2-fold: to identify good practices in the SRH field, with a particular focus, whenever possible, on migrant populations, and to identify relevant and inclusive indicators to monitor SRH in Portugal. A Delphi panel (via online survey) with 66 experts (researchers, teachers, and health professionals) and 16 stakeholders (non-governmental organizations, civil society, and governmental organizations) was implemented in two rounds. Panelists were asked to state their level of agreement (5-point Likert-type scale) regarding four different SRH areas: Sexual Health, Reproductive Health, Social-Structural Factors, and Good Practices. Items were based on literature review and a World Café with 15 experts and stakeholders. Participation rate was 68% and response rate was 97% on the first round.

Kurdistanis put their trust mostly in television as the most accessible source of information across the region. Conversely, social media was not considered a reliable source of information during the pandemic. The results of this survey highlight a strong lack of trust in federal political figures and institutions. At the regional level, Kurdistanis are divided along lines of political affiliation and geography. While respondents from Duhok and Erbil expressed a high level of trust in the KRG, people of Silemani are openly distrustful of the KRI government. The institutions responsible for mitigating the impact of the pandemic attract the highest level of trust across governorates. This is the case with the KRG Ministry of Health and Ministry of Interior, including the security forces and the police. Conversely, participants expressed strong rejection of both parliaments that sit in Baghdad and Erbil. The legislative body attracted the least trust among the population surveyed. The COVID-19 pandemic has fostered social cohesion in the KRI. The majority of respondents believed that all Kurdistanis, including both vulnerable and non-vulnerable groups, should be treated equally and should receive the same amount of government support during the pandemic. That being said, a significant number of respondents recognized the importance of caring for those most vulnerable, such as the elderly, Syrian refugees, and International Displaced Persons (IDPs) more broadly. Finally, respondents have been shown to rely mostly on their social circles and family throughout the crisis, rather than regional and federal institutions. Those

If by now it is well established that the policies that regulate the mobility of migrant labour play a crucial role in enabling capitalist accumulation in contemporary global agriculture, few analyses have delved into the actual mechanisms which make this possible, and into their histories. The argument is developed by reference to the Italian case, showing how subsequent waves of substitution of Italian labourers with migrants, that began in the 1980s, have followed different patterns. It argues that these can be understood by reading them against the grain of the changes accruing in the transnational migration regime. Thus, precarisation and segmentation of the labour force in the farming sector are shown to have been actively fostered by policies which have made of undocumented or differentially included labour one of the pillars upon which globally integrated food production has relied for the past three decades. Whilst based on national-scale statistics and secondary literature, the analysis also builds upon a sustained presence and engaged participant research in some of the Italian agroindustrial enclaves that record the highest presence of migrant labour.","[0.01512189, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02278138, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00106926, 0.0, 0.10154854, 0.0, 0.0, 0.20413497]",politics,"[9.9999900e-01 9.9999900e-01 1.0000000e-06 1.0000000e-06 1.0000000e-06

Hand washing is an important way to prevent cross-contamination with pathogens during chicken preparation. This study, which is part of the EU Horizon 2020 funded consortium SafeConsume, aimed at quantifying and understanding hand washing practices in three categories of households and five European countries. A quantitative survey (n=1889) was combined with qualitative research, during which 75 participants from France, Norway, Portugal, Romania, and the United Kingdom were observed and interviewed. An original method for analysing video with “The Observer XT” software was developed to identify when and how risk arises. The quantitative survey and qualitative research data revealed that touching raw chicken was more frequent in Romania and Portugal. Practices to avoid touching raw chicken were declared and observed, although observations revealed that these practices were not always consistently followed. Only a third of the participants washed their hands with soap after handling raw chicken with important variations among countries (a majority in Norway and in the UK, a few in France and Portugal, none in Romania), in contrast to the results of the survey. Observations and interviews suggested that rinsing hands with water only and washing hands with soap are considered equivalent by many people. Barriers to washing hands due to improper equipment were mainly observed in Romania. Washing hands after touching raw chicken was motivated by food safety concerns for some participants in Norway and the UK, but not in France a

Data collection was conducted online at the national level in Portugal, with 9,176 complete replies and a response rate of 21%. Predictors stemming from theoretical models of an intra-individual, occupational, organizational, and socio-psychological nature were measured using an online/paper survey. Results were analyzed through a significantly modified version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) after transformations to address the fit of this measure in this sample. Results show that 66% of physicians have high levels of emotional exhaustion, 33% high levels of depersonalization, and 39% high levels of decrease of personal accomplishment. Moreover, a first set of hierarchical multiple regression models with burnout symptoms reveals that organizational resources, demands of the relationship with the patients and of work schedule are consistently important predictors of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization on top of other theoretically relevant predictors. A second set of regression models with the organizational-level variables shows that, aside from organizational variables, other context variables, like procedural justice and teamwork, have the most substantial predictive value. These results highlight the importance of recognizing physicians’ burnout as a phenomenon that is predicted by a wide variety of factors, but also the importance of attendin

Methods Item responses from the 10‐item EPDS were obtained from 5,157 participants (765 major depression cases) from 22 primary screening accuracy studies that compared the EPDS to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID). Unidimensionality of the EPDS latent construct was verified using confirmatory factor analysis, and an item response theory model was fit. Optimal test assembly (OTA) methods identified a maximally informative shortened form for each possible scale length between 1 and 9 items. The final shortened form was selected based on pre‐specified validity and reliability criteria and non‐inferiority of screening accuracy of the EPDS as compared to the SCID. Results A 5‐item short form of the EPDS (EPDS‐Dep‐5) was selected. The EPDS‐Dep‐5 had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.82. Sensitivity and specificity of the EPDS‐Dep‐5 for a cutoff of 4 or greater were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73, 0.89) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.80, 0.90) and were statistically non‐inferior to the EPDS. The correlation of total scores with the full EPDS was high (r = 0.91). Conclusion The EPDS‐Dep‐5 is a valid short form with minimal loss of information when compared to the full‐length EPDS. The EPDS‐Dep‐5 was developed with OTA methods using objective, pre‐specified criteria, but the approach is data‐driven and exploratory.

We also ascertain that professional science communicators are mostly invisible, though the public recognises the value of `translators'.","[0.03098292, 0.0, 0.02470497, 0.0, 0.02335614, 0.01828482, 0.00056681, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00036058, 0.0, 0.0]",politics,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

The work takes the form of a critical view correlating business leader’s comebacks, after a career setback, and the concept of leadership. In the first chapter are presented and discussed the most consensual and updated leadership types/styles and the new trends in the leadership field. Subsequently, are addressed some myths associated with the concept of leadership – in this section, the concepts of Emotional Intelligence and Social Intelligence are discussed. In the second chapter, is presented the data and the outputs that resulted from the interviews made to three Portuguese business leaders. The interviews were made in order to gather and analyze information, finding out what are the common aspects of a career setback and of a fighting back process, and to understand and draw conclusions regarding how the Portuguese market and business environment reacts to leaders that are hit by failure. Next, are discussed the three phases of the fighting back process. The shock phase, the retreat and reaction phase, and the comeback phase. At the end, in the third chapter, a conclusion is taken regarding the achievability of a leader to overcome the ultimate challenge that is to transform failure into success.","[0.03877304, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00260279, 0.0, 0.00639935, 0.01402062, 0.00313148, 0.0, 0.00495696, 0.01318283, 0.00928457]",politics,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 2.53413418e-06

Apesar da criação de soluções de governança multinível, globais, macro-regionais, nacionais e sub-nacionais abrangendo metas, marcos legais, normas e políticas internacio-nais, os vetores antrópicos das mudanças climáticas têm aumentado em ritmo e intensidade. A adaptação às alterações climáticas, enquanto objeto de política pública é um desafio multidimensional, de elevado grau de incerteza em relação aos riscos e impactos das medidas implementadas, que requer uma filosofia de intervenção integrada de base territorial, de natureza antecipatória face a um futuro pautado por uma inevitável mudança climática. Estas características desafiam os limites das culturas institucionais predominantes, sublinhando a necessidade de inovação quer ao nível processual, do desenho, financiamento e implementação de políticas públicas dedicadas, quer ao nível relacional, no desenvolver soluções de governança territorial multinível. Este texto é uma súmula introdutória à forma como, nos últimos 20 anos, a adaptação às alterações climáticas ganhou inquestionável centralidade no debate político e no quadro global, nacional e local de políticas públicas. Olhando para o padrão de governança climática local em Portugal através de uma lente institucional, o país mostra uma variação intra-nacional extrema. Decisivo para a capacidade de ação climática local é o processo de coprodução de conhecimento por meio do qual ela é alcançada, garantindo que novos entendimentos sejam realmente adotados e partilhados pelos atores envolvidos.

Yet, little attention has been giving to this phenomenon in Brazilian studies. This research sought to overcome this gap by verifying the relationship between sociodemographic variables of people with Vitiligo, as well as their perceptions of discrimination and severity of the disease in their qualities of life. It is a quantitative study with a descriptive and exploratory nature, in which 200 Brazilians with Vitiligo participated, most of them female (73%), with white skin colour (50.5%) and predominantly residents of Southeast Brazil (31.02%). For data collection, a sociodemographic questionnaire and the Vitiligo-specific health-related quality of life instrument (VitiQoL) scale were used. Results revealed that female participants, with black skin colour, low income and white patches in areas of easy social perception showed worse rates of quality of life. The findings are discussed with pertinent literature, and it is expected that they contribute to the development of public policies aiming to improve the quality of life of Brazilians with Vitiligo.","[0.00360486, 0.00199567, 0.01063449, 0.01665844, 0.00628422, 0.00290526, 0.06845223, 0.00881346, 0.01676903, 0.0, 0.03344101, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

Using minimal groups (N = 113), we manipulated ingroup (low vs. high) status, and primed unstable status positions to all participants. As expected, we found that SDO positively mediates the relation between ingroup identification and collective action, when ingroup's status is perceived to be low and status positions are perceived as highly unstable.

Design/methodology/approach The study was based on hierarchical cluster analysis, performed upon data collected from a survey to 113 shops, located in Aveiro ( n = 15), Lisbon ( n = 56) and Porto ( n = 42). Findings The study identified three clusters of shops according to the type of rural provenance products sold, services provided and clientele characteristics: the wine focused, the rural provenance focused and the generalist. The study confirms that in Portugal, small food retail outlets, with different rural provenance patterns and degrees of specialization have considerably grown in large cities over the last decade. Research limitations/implications The study contributes to typifying urban speciality food stores selling rural provenance products and to addressing critical research gaps on this topic. The study highlights the dynamism of small food retail outlets and their significance, mediating and responding to changing patterns of food consumption in urban spaces.

Distinguishing between these generative harm relations is, I argue, useful in accounting for the techno-sociality of a range of social harms, from gun violence and digital coercive control to forms of oppression, inequality and immiseration (re)produced by algorithms.","[0.02756, 0.05078217, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01318305, 0.0, 0.00212717, 0.0, 0.01450937, 0.0, 0.01222641]",sexuality,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.36974823e-06 1.00000000e-06

Cybersecurity is similarly a very broad concept and diverse field of practice. For computer scientists, the term ‘cybersecurity’ typically refers to policies, processes and practices undertaken to protect data, networks and systems from unauthorised access. Cybersecurity is used in subnational, national and transnational contexts to capture an increasingly diverse array of threats. Increasingly, cybercrimes are presented as threats to cybersecurity, which explains why national security institutions are gradually becoming involved in cybercrime control and prevention activities. This paper argues that the fields of cyber-criminology and cybersecurity, which are segregated at the moment, are in much need of greater engagement and cross-fertilisation. We draw on concepts of ‘high’ and ‘low’ policing ( Brodeur, 2010 ) to suggest it would be useful to consider ‘crime’ and ‘security’ on the same continuum. This continuum has cybercrime at one end and cybersecurity at the other, with crime being more the domain of ‘low’ policing while security, as conceptualised in the context of specific cybersecurity projects, falls under the responsibility of ‘high’ policing institutions. This unifying approach helps us to explore the fuzzy relationship between cyber- crime and cyber- security and to call for more fruitful alliances between cybercrime and cybersecurity researchers.","[0.01166658, 0.0, 0.00499165, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00409889, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01596749, 0.16139875, 0.0, 0.00596028]",criminology,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06

Their tone is often both elegiac and detached, at once keenly aware of and distant from the suffering occurring all around their author. This ambiguity becomes particularly apparent in the contrast between the remarkable everyday encounters the diaries describe and their broader cosmic and world-historical ruminations. In this paper, I want to suggest that this tension can be read as a response to the imperatives through which totalising thought shapes how subjects operating under its confines relate to time itself. This dynamic, which can already be found in Jünger’s own earlier work, is dramatized in the way that the diaries construct the alternative temporal perspective of the witness. The witness here is one who survives outside of, and yet also remains caught between, two temporal imaginaries characteristic of modernity: Totalising historicization – the sweeping narrative of progress that demands the sacrifice of the present individual and individual present – and mechanised temporality, that is, instrumentalised clock time.","[0.03078184, 0.00177448, 0.0095088, 0.00313553, 0.0, 0.00103295, 0.01144445, 0.00122928, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00211009, 0.00886507]",politics,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

This article analyses the tensions between these goals through interviews with policymakers who have direct knowledge of the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), which has functioned as an ‘offstage’, pre-market regulator for capital inflows to Australia. The tensions between these policy goals were manageable because the FIRB exercised its powers rarely, decisively and quietly, and the government believed that foreign investment did not threaten the national interest. The emergence of state-owned enterprises as foreign investors, however, significantly altered this calculus, and the FIRB has been tasked with assessing the national security implications of proposed investments.

Governments in some jurisdictions prevented contact between non-cohabiting sexual partners (except for couples in pre-existing relationships), while community organisations recommended people avoid casual sexual encounters. This article analyses Australian media articles, commentary and public health messages published during March to October 2020 to explore the normative assumptions underpinning these measures. Applying posthumanist perspectives and Warner’s (2002) conceptualisation of ‘publics’, we consider how COVID-19 public health advice enacts the (human) subject of public health as monogamous, coupled, and living with their partner or nuclear family. Those in non-normative relationships and households are not only excluded from this narrow enactment of the ‘ideal’ public health subject, but are rendered potentially risky disease vectors by virtue of their alternative kinship arrangements. We explore the implications of these findings for the more-than-human relationalities that shape health inequalities and processes of marginalisation during public health crises, and we offer suggestions for public health measures that address the needs of diverse ‘publics’.","[0.00604772, 0.13966914, 0.15816466, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00358475, 0.0, 0.00401821, 0.04261693, 0.0]",covid,"[1.0000000e-06 9.9999900e-01 1.0000000e-06 9.9999900e-01 1.0000000e-06

Universities, too, have been enhancing their study-abroad options as part of broader internationalization campaigns. In a short time, the number of Australian higher-education students undertaking study abroad as part of their undergraduate degrees has doubled, to one in five students. This significant investment follows from two beliefs: that Australia’s relations with Asia are significantly impacted by people-to people relations; and that formal, experiential learning is a particularly effective pedagogical method. But is this investment warranted? Do periods of short-term study in Indonesia enrich students’ understanding of the region, and of Australia’s relations with Asia? And do current undergraduates, who have unprecedented access to mobility through travel and tourism, gain anything from a formal and guided people-to-people experience? This article explores these questions through an in-depth investigation of the intensive-mode undergraduate unit ‘Australia and Asia’ run by the Faculty of Arts at Monash University from 2014 to 2017.

The attribution of an essential role to the legislator as an efficient cause appears to clash, however, with Aristotle's political naturalism. If the polis exists by nature and humans are by nature political animals (1253a1–2), then the question arises as to why active intervention by the legislator is necessary for a polis . Conversely, if the polis is an artefact of practical reason, then Aristotle's distinction between products of the intellect and natural entities seems to preclude the status of the polis as natural. In light of this apparent tension between different aspects of Aristotle's account of the origins of political communities, the current paper seeks to demonstrate their reconcilability. Section 1 considers the role of the Aristotelian legislator in light of broader Greek assumptions regarding law-making. Section 2 then considers the status of law-making expertise (νομοθετική) as part of political science (πολιτική) and examines the mode of practical reason that is exercised by the legislative founder. Finally, in section 3, and building on recent interpretations which have emphasized that Aristotle operates with an extended teleological conception of nature, I argue that acts of legislative founding and nature can consistently serve as joint causes of the polis , because the ‘products’ of the practical rationality of the architectonic legislator are themselves an expression of distinctly human nature.","[0.06664529, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00053104, 0.0, 0.00047588, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00070565, 0.0, 0.00068868]",politics,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

Once we accept Dummett’s thesis that the problem of abstract objects should be decided by considerations derived from the theory of meaning — in particular through an examination of the extent to which it is legitimate to attribute a reference to abstract singular terms — it becomes apparent, or at least so I have argued, that an intermediate position between platonism and nominalism is more plausible than its rivals. The problem with platonism is that it renders our epistemic access to abstract entities inscrutable insofar as it relies on a mysterious and superfluous notion of mind and language independence. Extreme nominalism, by contrast — in denying that it is legitimate to ascribe a reference to abstract singular terms at all — contradicts our capacity to form true sentences containing reference to abstract entities, while more sophisticated variants overlook the role played by our linguistic practice in the constitution of ‘thin’ objects of reference.","[0.0262436, 0.00035434, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00686439, 0.00286536, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00276157, 0.00567004, 0.00336021]",politics,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

Seventy years of law and development initiatives in Nepal have however had mixed results. Reforms to justice, strengthening democracy and rule of law governance have occurred alongside minimal reforms to the judicial system. In turn, good governance, legal empowerment of the poor and disadvantaged, fair access to justice and increased judicial responsiveness remain serious gaps in Nepal’s reform program. These gaps in justice delivery form part of a larger challenge posed by Nepal’s long history of struggle for rule of law and justice. Embedded structural inequalities and a political culture characterized by strengthened institutional measures ‘at the top’ and unmet demands for justice ‘from the bottom’ congeal the gaps to reform in Nepal. This paper focuses on two major areas: firstly, it stimulates a much needed discussion on law and development in Nepal. That is, how has law and development been explained, understood, and implemented? Secondly, it aims to contribute specifically to the discourse on approaches to judicial reform. Specifically, in relation to Nepal it asks how can judicial reform be operationalized in such a way that public trust in the judicial system as a guarantor of justice can be accomplished. The paper proposes that a concerted and more diligent effort in the area of judicial independence is an urgently required step in this direction.","[0.00230841, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00378007, 0.27911042, 0.00462261, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.09180622e-04

A ‘common sense’ rhetoric underpins support for police to be routinely armed. Armed police, it is argued, are inherently protective and improve safety for everyone. However, there is little empirical evidence to demonstrate that jurisdictions which deploy routinely armed police are intrinsically safer, or more effectively uphold the basic human rights of civilians to be safe. This paper acknowledges the work (in this journal) of Osse and Cano, who reported a clear association between fatal shootings by police and homicide rates across 11 jurisdictions. We re-focus their thesis to the specific context of the routine arming of police officers. We compare four jurisdictions – two are routinely armed, two are routinely unarmed – to examine the presumption that routinely arming our police makes the policed community safer. The findings are mixed and, in parts, surprising. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to support the expectation that the routine presence of armed police increases and ensures community safety. Further research is needed, but our findings provide an empirical basis from which to challenge calls to arm police in currently unarmed jurisdictions.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.287256521, 0.000247374744, 0.0]",criminology,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.50532195e-06 9.99999000e-01

It is important to ensure citizens' access to justice through justice reform initiatives. Past seventy years ofjustice and development initiatives in Nepal have contributed to reforming justice and strengthening democracy andrule of law, yet the challenges to sustain those efforts are enormous. Justice sector reform initiatives have become important to promote access to justice in order to achieve sustainable development. This will scale-up ""equal access to justice for all"" in line with Sustainable Development Goals (henceforthSDGs). As the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development enters its sixth year of implementation, it is important to see how access to justice is understood and implemented in Nepal. This article discusses Nepal's progress on the global goal for access to justice and rule of law, which is encapsulated in the Goal 16 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and focuses on how justice reform approaches better support achieving the goal. The article claims that while the challenges of achieving the goal are stark, considering the current pace of progress, the instrumental approaches chosen for justice reform is problematic. This article argues Nepal's efforts towards the SDGs and fulfilling its constitutional mandate requires a sharper focus on bridging the gap that exclude people from accessing justice; delivering access to justice for all in line with SDGs is possible through a realistic and participatory 'people-centred approach'.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00151352, 0.35432854, 0.00921291, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",politics,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

This relationship is seen as antagonistic, with the public being morally superior (Mudde and Kaltwasser, 2017). In this, it is important to note that populism does not align with a single political philosophy or position, and populist movements have emerged in a range of political contexts (Kaltwasser, 2013), as well as in various geographic locations and historical periods (Gidron and Bonikowski, 2013). For this reason, it is possible to view populism as a vehicle for greater inclusion in the political and social context, a situation that is generally accepted as beneficial for well-being and giving individuals a stake in their community (Taket et al, 2009). It is this aspect of populism that has implications for action in various areas that include community development but also public health, education and politics itself, in which grassroots activities may figure prominently (Aslanidis, 2007). Filc (2010) notes the significance of inclusion and exclusion in populist politics and finds that inclusion and exclusion have three separate types: material, symbolic and political. In this conceptualisation, material inclusion and exclusion relate to policies that provide benefits or support to specific groups within the population, while symbolic inclusion and exclusion derive from political rhetoric that can be altered to create new social understandings. Finally, political inclusion and exclusion have to do with structures in the political environment, such as

It introduces Charles Peirce’s distinction between symbols, indices and icons as three different kinds of signification whereby the sign picks out its object by learned convention, by unmediated indication, and by resemblance respectively. It is then argued that logical form is represented by the third, iconic, kind of sign. It is noted that icons uniquely enjoy partial identity between sign and object, and argued that this holds the key to Carroll’s puzzle. Finally, from this examination of sign-types metaphysical morals are drawn: that the traditional foes metaphysical realism and conventionalism constitute a false dichotomy, and that reality contains intriguingly inference-binding structures.

Medical tests, or investigative procedures for detecting and monitoring disease, play a central role in diagnosis. While testing promises diagnostic certainty or a definitive risk assessment, it often produces uncertainties and new questions which call for yet further tests. In short, testing, regardless of its specific application, is imbued with meaning and emotionally fraught. In this article, we explore individuals' ambivalent experiences of testing as they search for diagnostic certainty, and the anxieties and frustrations of those for whom it remains elusive. Combining insights from sociological work on ambivalence and the biopolitics of health, and drawing on qualitative interviews with Australian healthcare recipients who have undergone testing in the context of clinical practice, we argue that these experiences are explicable in light of the contradictory impulses and tensions associated with what we term ‘bio-subjectification’. We consider the implications of our analysis in light of the development of new tests that produce ever finer delineations between healthy and diseased populations, concluding that their use will likely multiply uncertainties and heighten rather than lessen anxieties.","[0.02465021, 0.01827829, 0.01272781, 0.00418394, 0.0, 0.00293916, 0.05627082, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00223111, 0.03040908, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

This counter-movement was symbolized by demonstrations by flag-carriers who found Park Geun-Hye's impeachment and Moon Jae-In's inauguration incomprehensible. They argued that Park was innocent, called for her release from prison, and claimed that Moon's election was illegitimate. An analysis of speeches made during conservative counter-protests between 2016 and 2019 illustrates how these activists reject the values of a new era in South Korean political and economic life. Instead, their speeches conveyed a clear desire to have the legacy of the industrialization generation recognized in contemporary South Korea. These flag-carriers are evidence that a marginalized set of desires and aspirations about South Korean nationalism and identity coexist with the progressive views of the candlelight protesters. The persistence of such an intense and partisan worldview, however, poses a threat to the future of liberal democracy in South Korea.

It often leads to further tests or treatments, perhaps hospitalisation, and sometimes unwelcome news about one’s future. Consequently, being tested is fraught with meaning and is likely to evoke strong emotional responses in those subject to its regimes, including anxiety, fear and uncertainty. In short, however one looks at it, testing is highly consequential and as much a socio-political phenomenon as a medical one. This special issue explores the socio-cultural, politico-economic, policy and regulatory factors shaping the practices of testing in healthcare, and the implications of testing. Before we introduce the articles and the interviews, we begin with some observations on recent trends in the practices of testing and offer a broad perspective on this field, drawing on ideas from science and technology studies (STS) and insights arising from our workshop. The topic of testing in healthcare is not new in sociology and other social sciences, and we acknowledge the various important contributions made by colleagues to date, including investigations of population-based screening and routine diagnostic practices in the clinic, specifically prenatal genetic testing and direct-to-consumer genetic testing (e.g., Armstrong & Eborall, 2012; Hallowell, 1999; Jutel, 2011, 2019; Mol, 2000, 2002; Tutton & Prainsack, 2011). This work has focused on discrete diseases/conditions or specific populations, screening and/or diagnostic practices, and the experiences of those who receive or deliver diagnoses.

In a 2008 paper I explored this, urging Brandom to 'go for gold' and embrace the hyperinferentialism that he sees as a step too far. But in that paper I relied exclusively on Peirce's anti-Cartesian writings of the 1860s. Here I extend my discussion to Peirce's apparently quite different theory of perception from 1902-3. I argue that despite the apparent differences, Peirce remains a hyperinferentialist, and his view remains an attractive alternative to Brandom's 'merely strong' inferentialism. My argument turns on an examination of how Peirce understands concepts diachronically, as habits of associating certain icons with certain real-world indices.

To rectify this, the aims of this review were (1) to establish the extent, range, and nature of research into smartphone apps with a primary crime prevention function; (2) to locate gaps in the primary crime prevention app literature; and (3) to develop a typology of primary crime prevention apps. Employing a scoping review methodology and following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, studies were identified via Web of Science, EBSCOhost, and Google Scholar. We included English-language research published between 2008 and 2020 that examined smartphone applications designed explicitly for primary crime prevention. Sixty-one publications met our criteria for review, out of an initial sample of 151 identified. Our review identified six types of crime prevention app examined in these publications: self-surveillance apps, decision aid apps, child-tracking apps, educational apps, crime-mapping/alert apps, and crime reporting apps. The findings of our review indicate that most of these forms of primary crime prevention apps have yet to be rigorously evaluated and many are not evidence-based in their design.

By highlighting Indigenous melodies, rhythms, ideas and experiences in the rock genre, Los Jaivas propose an alternative conception of the Chilean subject as Andean and not exclusively displaced-European, as maintained by Chile's institutions and mainstream culture. The music produced by Los Jaivas articulates a decolonial attitude. It recognises Indigenous values as an integral part of Chilean reality, adding a deeper dimension to the political critique of capitalism that occurred during the Unidad Popular period (1970-1973). Through the enduring music of their first albums and singles, Los Jaivas create an instance of decolonial aesthesis that has profoundly altered Chilean discourses of national identity.","[0.02696239, 0.01329638, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00592036, 0.01282407, 0.0, 0.00075367, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00264564, 0.00058612]",politics,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

This paper examines some notable tensions, still relevant today, in Constant’s domesticated liberal concept of popular sovereignty. These tensions, I contend, all point to the conclusion that Constant’s project of limiting popular sovereignty by appeal to a sacrosanct domain of rights rests on a liberal interpretation of the general will, which is in fact constitutive for the enjoyment of individual liberties. Section 2 argues that Constant’s location of popular sovereignty in the legislative general will, as determined by elected representatives, does not overcome the problem of the potential arrogation of the popular will by a partisan minority. Section 3 then examines Constant’s views on rights and the implications of his acknowledgement that the enjoyment of liberties depends upon the institutional guarantee provided by constitutional enactment. Finally, in section 4, I demonstrate that Constant’s valorization of individual self-development is inseparable from an idea of political liberty which reflects the priorities of a liberal elite.","[0.04540192, 0.00333453, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00722379, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01150945]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

This theoretical innovation is intended to drive computational security studies towards improved (and earlier) identification of information warfare, cyber-attack and covert influence activity across a range of platforms. The information influence assessment tool includes metrics underneath measures of timeliness, specificity, targeting and the level of integration and strategy to discern information influence along with the dissemination tactics applied to publicly available information. This establishes a baseline and can be used to identify changes in the level of strategy driven, state sponsored information activities. The information influence assessment tool is intended to drive computational security studies towards improved (and earlier) identification of information warfare, cyber- attack and covert influence activity across a range of platforms. Additionally, the analytical process could be significantly enhanced by automation of aspects, such as data collation and narrative, sentiment and network analysis. Applying the information influence framework to Russian operations in Crimea, Eastern Ukraine and the downing of MH17 demonstrated that it is a robust and sound framework to assess public information campaigns.

Disinhibition draws attention to the pragmatic, performative dimensions of intoxicant consumption while keeping the material constraints enacted by the stigmatisation of non-normative sexual and gender expression in view. A genealogy of dis/inhibition reveals its affinities with the pathologisation of sexual and gender minorities from the 19th century, enabling us to see how the consumption of intoxicating substances might emerge as part of processes of counter-corporealisation over the ensuing century. Drawing on qualitative research with LGBTQ+ drug and alcohol consumers in Australia, we explore how queer and trans cultures of sex and drug experimentation activate the mode of play and playfulness to engage in practices of queer world-making that counter the material pressures of 'inhibition'.

Bans, from public or private locations, are typically imposed summarily and presumed to be a meaningful deterrent to future problematic behaviours. The formalisation of licensee banning powers has created a civilianised police-enforceable power to punish by exclusion. In Victoria, the legislative framing of licensee barring order provisions precludes formal monitoring of their use. This article reports findings from interviews conducted with recipients. The conceptual and situational value of barring orders are acknowledged, but their capacity to act as a tangible deterrent or effective agent for behaviour change is far from conclusive. Barring orders constitute a civilianised summary power, which currently operates without scrutiny or accountability. Implications for the operational legitimacy of barring powers emerge from this study, in addition to broader considerations with respect to compliance, enforcement, oversight, and the importance of developing and examining alcohol policies through a gendered lens.","[0.02298841, 0.00199263, 0.00674804, 0.00608049, 0.00382813, 0.0, 0.01079854, 0.0, 0.00074404, 0.06192209, 0.01251006, 0.0]",criminology,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01

Most policing textbooks evade the question of what constitutes police power, instead creating a brief narrative arc, one of rationalist progress from semi-mythologised origins to contemporary legal and administrative structures. The extensive critique of policing in capitalist society from a Marxist perspective, which situates policing as an expression of the violence which is fundamental to capitalism, is acknowledged. However, we criticise as a major weakness the “implied alternative”: a social formation which does not rely on violence or the threat of violence. We argue that all societies are underpinned by violence; that all societies have policing in some form; and that large, complex modern societies require a reasonably professional and disciplined police organisation to function. This is the consequence of the Hobbesian social contract: individual citizens surrender their rights to use violence in return for the protection of the State. The benefits of this arrangement can be explained by borrowing Talcott Parson’s “monetary model” of power. By this view, police power is analogous to a fiscal system: the “power banks” of the State, of which the police are the most important, allow people to use power which is not their own. Like a fiscal system, police power too is dependent on public trust and confidence. This informs the notion of policing by consent, and the doctrine of minimum force which are explored in Chap. 3.","[0.0343834, 0.02356311, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.21924854, 0.0, 0.0]",criminology,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01

However, the understanding of multi-aquifer fractured bedrock systems and how they respond to episodic wet season rainfall recharge is still limited. This study used a comprehensive suite of isotopic tracers, hydrogeological and near-surface geophysical methods to characterise the multi-layer aquifer system on Milingimbi, a small bedrock island located in the tropics of the Arafura Sea, Northern Australia. Near-surface geophysics was used to determine the subsurface structure of the aquifer, including the spatial extent and thickness of the fresh groundwater lens and the shape of the transition zone. Pore water chloride profiles, hydrochemistry and δ18O and δ2H data supported the geophysics results. The lens was found to be 40 m thick on average, with an up to 70 m thick transition zone underneath. Water level time series data over 4 years showed that there was a strong tidal signal observed in the groundwater wells screened in the deeper aquifer and that the aquifer system showed a dynamic response to the wet season rainfall. Time series chloride and δ18O and δ2H rainfall and production bore data suggest that there was a freshening (i.e. lower salinity input) of the lens as a result of recharge during the wet season, which occurs up to 6 months after the event. Groundwater residence time indicators showed that the mean residence time in the lens was at least 25 years and the rate of recharge to the system was up to 200 mm y⁻¹.

By doing thematic analysis of the content of vlog videos generated by Chinese international students on both Chinese and English audio-visual platforms, we identify three overarching themes of their vlogging stories: ‘everyday personal experience sharing’, ‘vlogger-generated citizen journalism’ and ‘producing counternarratives’. We argue that Chinese international students creatively practice ‘actualizing digital citizenship’ through dual vlogging. Their vlogging implies a strong sense of civic engagement, connectivity and empowerment, and is conducive to the self-resilience of the affected group as well as their identity and solidarity building in the crisis. Our research advocates for a shift of digital citizenship studies to recognize the flexible, individualized and loosely networked ‘actualizing digital citizenship’ practice.

Radical enactivists have assumed that this insight must entail non-representationalism concerning at least basic minds. But what if it could be shown that representation is itself a form of skilled performance? I sketch the outline of such an account from the perspective of Peirce's pragmatist semiotics, which theorises signs as habits of associating specific cues with appropriate acts and schemas of ensuing experience. Within this framework, I argue, a naturalistic account of propositional structure can be constructed which transcends the symbolic-and in some instances even the linguistic-sphere, and offers new insights regarding the Information Processing Challenge, and the Hard Problem of Content.","[0.0372846789, 0.0112340773, 0.0, 0.0087399533, 0.0, 0.00730054958, 0.00841190172, 3.61389315e-05, 0.0, 0.00501744179, 0.00599259602, 0.00144539144]",politics,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

Given the nature and the complexity of root causes and consequences of these highly contested concepts, it should not be treated as a part of linear historical processes where one event led to another. Sri Lanka presents case of how intersecting not only ethnicity and violence but also religion, caste, class, linguistic, and cultural mosaics have been and might be billeted within the borders of a nation-state. However, state building in Sri Lanka has been riddled with paradoxes. The curious notion of numerically dominant ethnic group, Sinhala manifesting a ""minority complex"" or anxieties about minority groups, Tamil and Muslims, is evident in the rise of Sinhala Buddhist nationalism during the nineteenth and the twentieth century of the country. Since state building has often meant centralization and a single ethnic group dominating the symbolic framework of the nation, there has been the tendency by minority groups such as Tamil and Muslims who have felt marginalized by the process to reinvent new collective ethnic identities. Moreover, cultural-religious minorities have responded to such hegemonic state-building process through mobilization of both non-violence and violent means. A complicated coming together of anti-minority sentiment at the level of the state, permissive politics that made violence a possibility, and the utilizing of this permissive violent politics for working out various class and caste enmities resulted in an extremely difficult political time for Sri Lanka in the 1980s. However, the central narrative through which the prevalence of violence was understood was the ethnic conflict. This paper too shall lay out the impor

During the 1970s, while Chile still suffered under the dictatorial rule of General Augusto Pinochet, Lemebel studied to become a school teacher specializing in Fine Arts – the first in his family to do so. After graduating, he worked as a school teacher in a series of schools; however, he was fired from two of his appointments for openly identifying as gay. Between 1987 and 1997, together with Francisco Casas, Lemebel formed the performing arts troupe Las yeguas del apocalipsis1 (The Mares of the Apocalypse), whose name alludes to the idea of the end of an era, specifically: the Chile of pre-1973. This implicit reference to the 1973 Chilean experience is a loaded one, as post-1973 Chile was the testing ground for expansion of the current hegemonic economic logic and practice: neoliberalism. Neoliberal theories were first put into practice in Chile, under experimental shock conditions, as part of Augusto Pinochet’s economic and social policy program, which was heavily influenced by the Chicago School of Economics and its formation of a new wave of Chilean economists through the Universidad Católica de Santiago, known as the ‘Chicago boys’. Lemebel’s work is a reaction against the myths of Chile under neoliberalism. In the 1990s, in the first few years of the transition towards democracy, Chile presents an image of itself as a successful economic miracle, a developed nation without poverty that is only capable of looking forward at the cost of ignoring the ignominy of its recent past.

Second, it proposes a new approach to understanding ‘technology–harm relations’. Bringing the theory of critical realism, Simondon and Floridi into conversation, the proposed approach offers a stratigraphy of harm that enables us to excavate the different layers of human–technology and technology–harm relations. In doing so, it enables us to distinguish between four technology–harm relations that untangle the socio-technicality of harmful events: instrumental utility harms, generative utility harms, instrumental technicity harms and generative technicity harms.","[0.04107945, 0.02976086, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01081834, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00596756, 0.0, 0.00941829]",politics,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06

Although clinical pharmacists have been shown to enhance patient health outcomes and reduce costs among adult patients, the impact of a pharmacist in paediatric patient care has not been extensively documented. Methods: A team of pharmacists was established to conduct a systematic review of the literature. A title scan of papers in 5 databases was performed by 14 pharmacists using the MeSH terms Pharmacists, Medical Intervention, Paediatrics and Cost-Benefit Analysis. The underpinning research question was: “How do the professional activities of a clinical pharmacist impact the health outcomes of paediatric in-patients?” The abstracts of suitable titles were scanned and articles were read to assess relevance. Relevant articles were then evaluated independently by at least two members of the team, using critical appraisal tools suitable for quantitative, qualitative or systematic review studies. Results: The initial search identified 327 citations which after full text review and application of the scoring tool, resulted in 10 studies included in the systematic review. The average number of interventions reported varied from study to study. Dosing recommendations, pharmacokinetics and drug allergy alerts were the most commonly recorded interventions by pharmacists for a paediatric population. Evidence from this review will be used to formulate improvements to in-patient paediatric care. Conclusion: Clinical pharmacists have a positive impact on inpatient paediatric care which included both health and economic benefits.","[0.0, 0.00267851, 0.03201998, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.08220694, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.12430646, 0.0]",community_service,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

Since 2017, when the term was mobilised spectacularly in the US entertainment industry, other industries have undertaken an examination of their own practices and norms. In this paper we consider the implications of this political moment for the discipline of anthropology, and specifically the idea of ‘the field’ in the context of anthropological training in Australia. We argue that fieldwork is tacitly, and sometimes explicitly, fetishised by anthropologists as a transformative domain in which the normative rules of gendered interaction are temporarily suspended in favour of fruitfully engaging informants. Drawing on Bourdieu, we argue that ‘the field’ (the methodological and symbolic space) is a ‘field’ (a domain of recognition) that junior anthropologists enter with the expectation that they will suffer as a necessary part of their initiation, placing some PhD students at an enhanced risk of sexual violence. We reflect on the attitude of anthropologists to fieldwork as part of a professional illusio, a belief in the value of ‘playing the game’ that limits our capacity to modify our methodology to make it safer for neophytes and to reimagine a more just discipline.","[0.03880039, 0.1117512, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02554008, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00774098, 0.0, 0.0]",sexuality,"[9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01

This is a written version of a presentation I gave at the “Peirce’s Mathematics” conference, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, November 25-27, 2015, which was organized by Professor Fernando Zalamea. The piece owes much to the inspiration of Prof. Zalamea's writings on philosophy of mathematics.","[0.01564483, 0.00181719, 0.00045334, 0.00195954, 0.00442148, 0.00488128, 0.00045438, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00202691, 0.00181922, 0.0]",politics,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

The report showed that while in the past the 'zero tolerance' approach had been the norm, more recently there had been a growing awareness in Catholic schools that it is possible to respond to the needs of drug-using students while being respectful of the duty of care to other students. Moreover, harm reduction was accepted as a serious objective for drug policy and practice in Australian Catholic schools. The paper canvases the key issues that emerged from the consultation and suggests what 'good practice' looks like, providing useful guidance for both Catholic and non-Catholic schools alike. For those of us outside the Catholic school system, the paper provides an enlightening read about how substance use can be best addressed within schools.

However, there is limited research on the level of mental ill‐health among fishers and on the nature of stressors that contribute to their psychological distress. This paper focuses on the experiences of commercial wild‐catch fishers and analyses the results of an Australian national survey conducted in 2017 (n = 872) (Appendix S1). We first assess underlying themes in perceived stressors, identifying three distinct categories termed ‘traditional risks’, ‘modern uncertainties’ and ‘future concerns’. Second, we assess the level of self‐reported psychological distress, demonstrating higher occurrence of high to very high psychological distress among commercial fishers in comparison with the national population. Third, we examine the relationship between different groups of stressors and psychological distress, finding that stronger perceptions of both ‘traditional risks’ and ‘modern uncertainties’ are associated with greater levels of psychological distress among fishers. Third, recognizing diversity within the industry, we examine differences in these relationships among skippers and crew (work role), and inshore versus offshore fishers (fishing location). Our analysis demonstrates that ‘traditional risks’ and ‘modern uncertainties’ differentially impact on fisher mental health and depend on the individual's role in the industry and their fishing location. The findings suggest that changes to factors associated with modern uncertainty stressors—including government management techniques, red tape, media representation and political support—could significantly improve mental health in the commercial fishing sector.","[0.01999186, 0.00639143, 0.13110536, 0.00523215, 0.0, 0.00076858, 0.04494017, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00240801]",covid,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

The first half of the article highlights the opportunities that online and offline participant observation can provide in terms of understanding family transnational networks. Going beyond an ego-based narrative approach in interviews, digital family ethnography shows how social network analysis and reflexivity can bring depth to a study on family by including the researcher’s position vis-à-vis the research participants. The second half of the article discusses challenges in using these combined online and offline methods and how these challenges might be mitigated in future studies. In particular, the article look at problems faced with interviews, multimedia usage, and social media analysis related to the researcher’s background and in working with different age groups. In the transnational family context, social media and electronic communication are critical parts of contemporary ethnographic methodologies, and the discussion thus centres on including online personhood in the research. The study concludes that although digital family ethnography methodologies have limitations, they can be used to account for the transforming relationships that make up family mobility.","[0.020780163, 0.0, 0.00148576146, 0.0133156091, 0.00275405362, 0.073151126, 0.0188847752, 0.0571394367, 0.0391938855, 8.25071785e-05, 0.0593730634, 0.0167906007]",education,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 6.14302057e-06

Slamming refers in this context to the practice of injecting drugs – typically crystal methamphetamine – intravenously. To pair ‘slamming’ with ‘sex’ is to propose that a particular mode of drug administration is constitutive of a particular kind of sex – a relatively novel idea that deserves some unpacking. What does it mean to make a route of drug administration definitional in the delineation of a sexual practice? What does this move reveal about contemporary practices of sex and drug consumption?

Such humanitarian events require immediate responses as well as effective longer-term activities to aid communities recover. The global response is now valued over US$27 billion annually. More than half a million people are estimated to work in this sector, the majority being locally engaged staff. The international community provides significant resources to assist local communities impacted by these humanitarian emergencies. This aid flows through multiple channels, including national and regional governments, international non-governmental organisations and local community based organisations. Increasing the skills and knowledge of leaders and managers of these responses is a critical need to ensure the most effective recovery in communities as well as use of resources. Understanding the professional journey in the humanitarian sector is vital, but currently limited. As the humanitarian sector continues to expand, greater focus on the skill-set needed by humanitarian workers responding to these events is needed. However, tensions exist between the primacy given to the experiences and soft-skills of humanitarian workers over the value of academic qualifications.

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to examine associations between the use of digital platforms and adherence to the physical activity guidelines among Australian adults and adolescents during the COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions in April and May 2020. METHODS A national online survey was distributed in May 2020. Participants included 1188 adults (mean age 37.4 years, SD 15.1; 980/1188, 82.5% female) and 963 adolescents (mean age 16.2 years, SD 1.2; 685/963, 71.1% female). Participants reported demographic characteristics, use of digital platforms for physical activity over the previous month, and adherence to moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and muscle-strengthening exercise (MSE) guidelines. Multilevel logistic regression models examined differences in guideline adherence between those who used digital platforms (ie, users) to support their physical activity compared to those who did not (ie, nonusers). RESULTS Digital platforms include streaming services for exercise (eg, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook); subscriber fitness programs, via an app or online (eg, Centr and MyFitnessPal); facilitated online live or recorded classes, via platforms such as Zoom (eg, dance, sport training, and fitness class); sport- or activity-specific apps designed by sporting organizations for participants to keep up their skills (eg, TeamBuildr); active electronic games (eg, Xbox Kinect); and/or online or digital training or racing platforms (eg, Zwift, FullGaz, and Rouvy). Overall, 39.5% (469/1188) of adults and 26.5% (255/963) of adolescents reported using digital platforms for physical activity. Among adults, MVPA (odds ratio [OR] 2.0, 95% CI 1.5-2.7), MSE (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.5-4.5), and combined (OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.0-3.8) guideline adherence were higher among digital platform users relative to nonusers. Adolescents’ MVPA (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.3), MSE (OR 3.1, 95% CI 2.1-4.4), and combined (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.1-9.0) guideline adherence were also higher among users of digital platforms relative to nonusers. CONCLUSIONS Digital platform users were more likely than nonusers to meet MVPA and MSE guidelines during the COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions in April and May 2020. Digital platforms may play a critical role in helping to support physical activity engagement when access to facilities or opportunities for physical activity outside the home are restricted.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.02926156, 0.00422765, 0.0, 0.10955688, 0.1365801, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04120595]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 6.21636194e-06 9.99999000e-01

Yet despite evidence that rates of consumption are higher among LGBTQ populations, research exploring the gen-dered and sexual dynamics of these forms of consumption is limited and tends to frame such consumption as a response to stigma, marginalisation and discrimination. Against this dominant explanatory frame, this article explores the diverse experiences of LGBTQ consumers, and in so doing highlights both the pleasures and benefits of consumption, as well as potential risks and harms. Contributing to the growing body of ontopolitically oriented research that treats the materiality of drugs as emergent and contingent, we trace the ontologies of drugs, sexuality and gender that LGBTQ subjects generate through specific practices of consumption. Our analysis draws on qualitative interviews with 42 self-identified LGBTQ people from an Australian study designed to explore how sexual and gender-diverse minorities pursue particular drug effects to enhance or transform their experience of gender and/or sexuality. Our participants' accounts illuminate how drug consumption materialises in relation to sex, desire and play where it enhances pleasure, facilitates transgression and increases endurance. In the context of gender variance, our findings suggest that drug use can transform gendered experience and enable the expression of non-normative gender identities, in the process challenging gender binarism. By considering the productive role of drugs in enacting queer identities, this article treats drugs as 'technologies of the self' (Foucault 1988) and explores how drug consumption, sex and gender shape each other across a range of settings. We conclude by reflecting on the implications of our findings for research and service provision, and suggest ways of engaging LGBTQ consumers in terms that address their diverse priorities and experiences.","[0.00458252, 0.34435196, 0.0, 0.01580617, 0.0, 0.00632395, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01395739, 0.0, 0.00181538, 0.0]",sexuality,"[1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

He was also among the first to teach peace studies in Australian universities and is remembered for his activism on human rights, peace, and environmental issues as well as his scholarship. Jemma Purdey is researching and writing a biography of Herb Feith with particular focus on his engagement with Indonesia, both as scholar and humanist.

The case resulted in considerable debate about the ill‐treatment of rape complainants and prompted the Gillen Review into the Laws and Procedures in Serious Sexual Offences. Gillen proposed the introduction of separate legal representation (SLR) to safeguard complainants’ sexual history and medical records pre‐trial. Since the Review was published, however, scepticism about the applicability of complainant SLR within an adversarial context remains. We examine the arguments for and against SLR in adversarial systems and propose a ‘Gillen‐plus’ framework for SLR that would not interfere with the accused's rights or public interest and could provide the basis for reform across other adversarial jurisdictions.

I sketch an alternative enactivism which draws on Peirce’s pragmatic semiotics, and understands signs as habits whose connections with rich schemas of possible experience render them subject to increasing degrees of self-control. The talk’s key innovation is to align this cyclical process of habit cultivation with Peirce’s representationalist icon-index-symbol distinction, in a manner which I explain.

Despite the connections between sexual experimentation and substance use, LGBTIQ consumption practices have rarely received the attention they deserve within the alcohol and other drug (AOD) field. In this paper, we draw on concepts from post-structuralist policy analysis to analyse how AOD consumption among sexual and gender minorities is constituted in the policies of three Australian LGBTIQ health organisations. Following Carol Bacchi's (2009, p. xi) observation that we are ""governed through problematisations rather than policies"", we consider how substance use in LGBTIQ populations has been formulated as a policy problem requiring intervention. Doing so allows us to identify the normative assumptions about minority sexual and gender identities that underpin dominant problematisations of LGBTIQ substance use. These include: a) high rates of AOD use in LGBTIQ populations constitute problems in and of themselves, regardless of individual patterns of use; b) LGBTIQ people are a vulnerable population with specialised needs; and c) sexualised drug use is associated with ""disinhibition"" and a range of risks (including HIV transmission, drug dependence and mental health issues). Addressing the implications of these assumptions for how LGBTIQ communities are governed, we suggest that problematisation is

In this paper I suggest that this lack of clarity is at least partly caused by a certain historical obfuscation of the roots of the founding three-way distinction between syntax, semantics and pragmatics in Charles Peirce’s pragmatist philosophy of language. I then argue for recovering and revisiting these original roots, taking indexicality as a case-study of how certain questions connected with the distinction which are currently considered complex and difficult may be clarified by a ‘properly pragmatist pragmatics’. Such a view, I shall argue, upends a certain priority usually accorded to semantics over pragmatics, teaching that we do not work out what terms mean in some abstract overall sense and then work out to what use they are being put; rather, we must understand to what use terms are being put in order to understand what they mean.","[0.03062951, 0.00337233, 0.0, 0.00046197, 0.0, 0.01183882, 0.00956018, 0.00351793, 0.00294849, 0.0, 0.02045564, 0.0024117]",politics,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Despite these widely recognised harms, there is limited literature on using strategic intelligence resources to understand and assess transnational threats to enable action to reduce them. Whilst there is growing consensus that national security and national law enforcement intelligence challenges are moving closer together-especially in relation to transnational threats-there is very little theory or practitioner guidance. This article presents an applied national law enforcement case study; the provision of strategic intelligence assessments to senior decision-makers of the Australian Federal Police intended to improve decision-making. During this case study, practitioners drew on national security intelligence approaches and analytical techniques to produce strategic assessments of transnational threats. The case study addressed challenges raised in the literature as obstacles to effective strategic intelligence, including ambiguity relating to the role of intelligence in the criminal environment, a broad range of divergent threat types and the need to demonstrate value of strategic intelligence for decision-makers. This has broader applicability in different jurisdictions and on different topics due to the focus on consultation , engagement and collaboration alongside traditional intelligence processes. Given the lack of literature in the field, it makes a contribution to understanding and developing best practice in strategic intelligence as applicable to national policing and security.

This study examined the offending records of people who received bans and explored whether anti-social offences reduced after the imposition of a police-imposed ban. A de-identified dataset was obtained from Victoria Police, comprising persons who received police-imposed bans in one Australian city between 2010 and 2017. Analyses were conducted to examine charging histories and offence types before and after receipt of the ban. Of those who received bans, 70.7% had recorded offences before the ban. The median number of charges before and after receiving a ban were not significantly different with respect to both anti-social behaviours and other behaviours. However, when examining short term effects (two years prior and post receiving a ban), there was a significant increase in anti-social offending, specifically public order offences (d = 0.67), after receiving a ban compared to before. Most of the ban recipients had an established record of anti-social behaviours. As a short-term sanction which limits access to specific locations, Victoria’s police-imposed bans do not appear to deter recipients from repeat offending or change already established patterns of anti-social behaviours. Consideration should be given to extending the permissible length of bans and to ensuring more effective enforcement. In addition, alternative interventions or diversions for those with a record of anti-social offending, which could be initiated on-the-spot, may be more effective in reducing undesirable behaviours in and around licensed premises.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.00191343, 0.0, 0.00095399, 0.0, 0.03152349, 0.0, 0.0017643, 0.11838439, 0.00549256, 0.0]",criminology,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

In their struggle to define what the authors call the ‘national narrative’, would-be national leaders seek to develop a story about the nation’s past, present and future. These stories feature a unique plot, set of characters, and a moral that the political narrator hopes will resonate. In contemporary Indonesia, the authors assess two prominent national narratives: the technocratic and populist national narratives. The book concludes with an analysis that considers other potential sources of ideas about the nation, as well as the potential implications for domestic politics and Indonesian grand strategy.

Approximately 6 months prior to presentation, she was seen for shortness of breath and chest pain. A CT of the chest revealed multiple new non-calcified pulmonary nodules bilaterally. PET/CT demonstrated mild FDG uptake in multiple lung nodules, with no significant extra-thoracic sites of abnormal FDG uptake. A CT guided lung biopsy showed a low grade, smooth muscle tumor. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for smooth-muscle actin and desmin, estrogen and progesterone receptor and was negative for CD117, HMB-45, CD34, pan cytokeratin and EMA. She underwent wedge resection of one of the nodules which confirmed the above findings. A cytogenetic analysis was also performed, which was consistent with pulmonary BML. She ultimately underwent left lower lobe resection and was started on a daily aromatase inhibitor. BML is a rare disease usually seen in women of reproductive age.

The application and rapid evolution of 3D printing technology has created new challenges for law and regulation, and represents an interesting security paradox, albeit one which until now has received scant attention in the criminological or policing literature. On the one hand, 3D printing denotes a significant shift in the creation and use of objects, ranging from food to body parts, and more controversially, weaponry. On the other hand, the use of this technology to create items such as firearms and weapons signifies a potential safety, security, and legal challenge. We explore the emergence of 3D printing and its use to create firearms along with the theoretical challenges to legal design and enforcement presented by this decentralised technology. We also present some empirical data on instances of 3D printed firearms and firearm parts being detected internationally, and some jurisdictions’ legal and policy responses. We conclude by considering that any regulation of 3D printed firearms must be based on a robust evidence base and take proper account of citizens’ rights, but also that any national regulation will be in tension with the transnational and decentralised nature of the technology.","[0.01711479, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00170451, 0.00495514, 0.00291179, 0.0, 0.00914793, 0.04592145, 0.08706523, 0.0, 0.03484523]",criminology,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

With a focus on Western jurisdictions and by examining a range of documentary, media and data sources, this book provides an evidence-based examination of the question: Do police really need guns? This book first provides detailed insight into the armed policing tradition and perceptions/expectations with respect to police and firearms. A range of theoretical concepts regarding policing, state power and the use of force is applied to an examination of what makes the police powerful. This is set against the minimum force tradition, which is typified by policing in England and Wales. Consideration is also given to the role played by key tropes and constructs of popular culture. Drawing on Surette’s model of symbolic reality, the book considers contrasting media traditions and the positioning of firearms within narrative arcs, especially the role of heroes. The book concludes by drawing together the key themes and findings, and considering the viability of retaining and/or moving towards non-routinely armed police.","[0.02191823, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.27663125, 0.0, 0.0]",criminology,"[9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01

The image of the silent, suffering and childlike figure became the image and symbol of Chinese womanhood for the West. Set alongside the emerging figure of the modern Western girl, healthy, active and independent, the Chinese slave girl remains silenced, mute, passive and childlike, linked in the Western archives to a traditional culture and the practices of antiquity. Women's organisations engaged in both Britain and Australia in the inter-war period refined and sustained a traditionalist feminist and maternalist paradigm of care for the mothers and children of China . This feminism employed an essentialist and colonialist project without a concern for cultural difference. At another level, as this paper will argue, some Western feminist groups and individuals, particularly those on the ground, articulated a different feminism, more internationalist and racially aware. This article studies these shifts in the work of Western feminist activists in and around mainland China in the1920s and 1930s. Western women were 'thinking with interest and sympathy of the women of the East', wrote the British activist Edith Pye on her return from China in 1928. Western feminists were interested in China in the in the inter-war period, and they were sympathetic towards the modern Chinese woman and the Chinese girl. This paper also seeks to critique such notions of sympathy. In traditional Chinese society

The ‘idea of being Greek’ often represents a positive resource for personal and group identity, even though what constitutes being Greek may be different depending on the cultural lens through which it is viewed in the experience of each generation. Nonetheless, core domains associated with the concept of being Greek include the Greek language, the Greek Orthodox religion and various daily cultural practices. This paper will discuss findings across a number of recent studies undertaken in Melbourne, Australia taking an emic and etic perspective that all utilize the emergent methodology of narrative ethnography to explore migration, identity and wellbeing in the Greek community as well as the idea of being Greek in diaspora. The results suggest that there are emotional benefits associated with cultural identity and overall positive wellbeing and that, for those living in diaspora, whether migration was planned or not, a cultural community, cultural activities and membership in a distinct group are positive resources in fostering social connectedness. From a social perspective on health, this extends beyond the physiological/clinical elements of health and wellbeing and emphasizes the various social and intangible benefits of positive outlook and the very significant role that culture, and cultural practices play in the group social context by contributing to the perception of health and wellbeing in the Greek diaspora community across generations.

The United Nations Environment Assembly has declared the current waste problem a “global crisis” (Parker 2019), with estimates predicting that the present rate will worsen threefold by 2050 based on existing consumption and disposal rates (Ellis 2018). The international community has responded with expanding laws and regulations that seek to ensure that waste is disposed of in safe, sustainable and renewable ways. Such measures, however, have increased the costs of disposal and have inadvertently enlarged illegal markets in dumping and transference (European Commission 2019). This article examines the ways in which transnational corporations have avoided the rising costs of lawful disposal by shipping their waste to poor countries in the Global South—often with devastating social and environmental impacts.

This article presents findings from research on the drivers behind women’s increasing rates of custodial remand in Victoria—a jurisdiction that has significantly restricted access to bail through legislative reforms. Drawing on data derived from interviews with criminal defence and duty lawyers, we outline how bail and remand practices systematically disadvantage women experiencing housing insecurity and domestic and family violence (DFV), increasing their risk of becoming trapped in longer-term cycles of incarceration.

Finnis’s account of the basic requirements of practical reasonableness and defense of the methodological device of “focal meaning” both have recourse to Aristotle’s claim that, in ethics and politics, things should be judged in terms of how they appear to the mature practically reasonable person. The current paper examines the normative role played by the spoudaios within Finnis’s natural law theory and provides a defense of that role against the objection that it lacks justificatory force because it is dependent upon circular reasoning. Section one contextualizes Finnis’s use of the spoudaios by considering its Aristotelian origins and also sketches some reasons for its demise in subsequent moral theory. This serves as the basis for an assessment in section two of whether Finnis’s employment of the spoudaios as an ethical exemplar conflates explanation and justification, and therefore culminates in decisionism.

We explore how safety, a complex construct, can be usefully measured, and then compare in detail the four chosen jurisdictions. Using publicly available data, published documents and media sources, we analyse patterns of crime, behaviour and risk, and explore the relationship between the routine arming of police officers, community and police officer safety. Precise causal relationships are difficult to establish with certainty. Our analysis is framed within a “positive effect” construct. The armed tradition of policing is underpinned by the assertion that the routine arming of police enables and ensures both community and police officer safety (see Chap. 4). If this assertion is correct, then in jurisdictions where police officers are routinely armed, the occurrence and rates of key categories of crime will be lower than in jurisdictions whose police are deployed without routinely carrying firearms, as will key measures of police officer safety. We also explore the idea of the “law of the instrument”: the proposition that the availability of a particular response increases the likelihood that it will be used, even in situations where other solutions are more appropriate. This principle would predict that routinely armed police are more likely to use firearms in situations where such use is not absolutely essential, even though all four jurisdictions have clear expectations of minimum-force policing (see Chap. 3). We conclude that the claimed benefits of the armed tradition of policing—a safer community pr

However, at this very time, the characteristics of the Swedish policy approach which were most admired by the visiting Australian unionists were undergoing important changes, to which they paid little attention but which critics from the Right strongly emphasized in response. The Australian labour movement interest in Sweden in the 1980s had some distinctive features. It focused on manufacturing industry and skills training policy, reflecting priorities of the main participating unionists. It was also particularly concerned with industrial democracy and work design, as a result of important earlier links between Swedish, Norwegian and Australian industrial relations scholars and practitioners which were forged from the late 1960s. Increased interest in Sweden partly arose from the search for a new political vision by particular elements of the Australian Left following their disillusionment with the Soviet Union after the 1968 Prague Spring. This article presents the results of interviews with participants and extensive archival research to provide new information and perspective on Scandinavian influences on the Australian labour movement; and the political background of the main people involved. It also analyzes how discussion of the 'Swedish model' receded in Australia following the economic setbacks of the early 1990s amid a perception that 'the model' had collapsed, but how policy interest in the continuing evident achievements of Sweden and the other Nordic nations

Once he has abandoned a strong reading of the context principle, in fact, Dummett’s strategy to derive answers to traditional epistemological and metaphysical problems through the theory of meaning appears to be placed in question. By acknowledging that the identification of an extralinguistic referent is an essential component of the determination of the truth-conditions of a sentence containing a singular term, Dummett is led to ascribe a privileged status to the model of meaning for concrete singular terms and to place a greater emphasis on the problem of our epistemological access to concrete particulars. The question of the extent to which it is possible to provide an account of identifying knowledge of abstract objects modelled on the case of concrete objects, moreover, raises difficult questions concerning the metaphysical problem of the distinction between concrete and abstract entities.

Methods: A national online survey was distributed in May 2020. Participants (adults: n=1,188, 82% female, mean age=37.4±15.1 years; adolescents: n=963, 71% female, mean age=16.2±1.2 years) reported demographic characteristics, use of digital platforms for physical activity over the previous month, and adherence to moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity and muscle strengthening guidelines. Multilevel logistic regression models examined differences in guideline adherence between those who used digital platforms (users) to support their physical activity compared to those who did not (non-users).

Whereas the principle of humanity requires us to care about others and to want to help them meet their vital needs, and so to be partial towards those others, the principle of justice requires us to consider their needs without the intrusion of our subjective interests or emotions so that we can act with impartiality. I argue that a deep form of caring lies behind both approaches and so unites them. In the course of the argument, I reject Michael Slote's sentimentalist form of an ethics of care, and expound Thomas Nagel's moral theory, which seems to lie at the opposite end of a spectrum ranging from moral sentiments to impersonal objectivity. Nevertheless, Nagel's theory of normative realism provides unexpected support for the thesis that a deep and subjective form of caring lies at the base of even our most objective moral reasons.","[0.00925759, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.06184167, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.006681, 0.05977277, 0.00776975]",politics,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

We conducted a cross-sectional, correlational questionnaire survey among 124 international and national Iranian top male wrestlers and recruited 106 male and female Iranian university students as a control group to provide more rationale of the variables within the context. Passion Scale, GritS Scale and Theories of Intelligence Scale (TIS) were used to measure the variables. The wrestlers scored high on the passion, grit and growth mindset scales, higher than the controls. Further analysis indicated a positive association between passion, grit and growth mindset on wrestlers as a whole and the subgroups. There were, however, no differences in terms of the level of competency and achievement within the groups of wrestlers, which counters former findings. This research contributes valuable insights into how passion, grit and growth mindset, considering the interplay between individual agency and an apt social context, sustain athletes' desire for tough training; motivate them to overcome a series of setbacks and challenging situations in order to meet further achievements in such a competitive sport.

However, little is known about the importance of interest changes, relative to stable interest levels, for predicting career outcomes. This study assessed the long-term predictive power of adolescent interest levels and interest growth for five career outcomes: degree attainment, occupational prestige, income, career- and job-satisfaction. The study used two 12- year longitudinal samples (N1 = 485; N2 = 1,290) with vocational interests measured across multiple waves from late adolescence to young adulthood. Results from both samples converged on three key findings. First, adolescents who showed better interest fit with their eventual vocation were more satisfied with their jobs over a decade later. Second, adolescent interests predicted objective career outcomes (i.e., degree attainment, occupational prestige, and income), revealing that early interests shaped educational and career choices. Third, interest changes were typically not associated with career outcomes, indicating that adolescent interest levels played a larger role. Together, these findings highlight the critical importance of childhood and adolescent interest development for guiding career trajectories and outcomes.

This paper highlights issues that arise at the system level and how limitations of policies and their implementation can lead to multiple capability failures and violations of human rights – such as the difficulties people with mobility impairments face if society fails to provide the necessary means to support their community mobility – and the various ways that situation may affect their other chosen occupations.","[0.02328201, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00981192, 0.019254, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00521467, 0.00649501, 0.0, 0.14217665, 0.03639689]",community_service,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

I address this classic, yet understudied, proposition by surveying participation in a demonstration that the ‘Panama Papers Leak’ triggered in Iceland in 2016. The demonstration was preceded by a sudden rise of large-turnout expectations, and attracted one-fifth of an urban population, allowing me to obtain event-specific, population-representative survey measures of the focal constructs (N = 821). The findings support hypotheses about the role of large-turnout expectations in collective action. They confirm that protest support (i.e. the value placed in the goal of the collective action) both raises large-turnout expectations and moderates their effects on protest participation. In fact, large-turnout expectations were associated with participation only if individuals supported the protest. Also, the findings imply that large-protest expectations trigger interpersonal relational dynamics that further motivate participation. The study thus supports and yet qualifies the role of the self-fulfilling prophecy in collective action.","[0.02083988, 0.0, 0.00839296, 0.01053478, 0.00780512, 0.0, 0.02508201, 0.01186228, 0.00313255, 0.00803673, 0.00259011, 0.0050363]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Women comprise almost half of all international migrants and many of those female migrants require maternity care in their host countries. While some literature describes how migrant women experience the healthcare provisions of their host countries, less is known about the experience of providing the service, from the perspective of the healthcare practitioners. In this study we adopt a social constructionist perspective to explore the discourses of knowledge healthcare professionals in Iceland draw on in their discussion of prenatal and postpartum healthcare in Iceland. Interviews were conducted with 16 healthcare professionals with extensive experience of providing maternity care to migrant women to understand how they construct and make sense of the needs and behaviour of migrant women seeking maternity care. Our findings suggest that some healthcare professionals subject migrant women to normative professional discourses of parenting, without considering how those ideals are tailored to white, middle class women. Migrant mothers and pregnant women are thus excluded from the middle-class mothering norms that are ascribed to Icelandic women. Our findings also highlight how national identity, such as being part of a gender equal society and the image of Iceland as a classless society, influe

An ES cascade model is presented for whale ES, which connects the five linked stages of such ES production: the biophysical structure, functions, ecosystem services, the benefits to human wellbeing, and associated values. They are further expanded to include the co-production processes of whale ES as well as its main stages, inputs, and flows. These processes are illustrated using examples from ARCPATH case studies of coastal communities dependent on whale resources: Húsavík in Iceland, Andenes in Norway, and Ilulissat/Disko Bay in Greenland.

The project is based on 32 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with participants holding 5- to 20-year-old doctorate degrees in Iceland. These interviews were then analyzed using a phenomenological approach. The results indicate that the men generally felt a higher level of agency regarding their work–life balance and time management than did the women, who more often expressed difficulties finding a proper balance and expressed being more stressed about the often fragmented time they had to combine their career and family obligations successfully. The study provides a picture of how societal time norms among highly educated people are very gendered and how time is still inevitably linked to power. The contribution of this study to prior studies is that, even when comparing highly educated people among whom it is more likely to find a higher level of egalitarian attitudes, in a country where gender equality is assumed to be at a higher level than in many other countries, women still seem to experience time differently from men in terms of personal autonomy.","[0.00793507, 0.02399792, 0.01165396, 0.13477954, 0.0, 0.01766234, 0.06264444, 0.0, 0.00527496, 0.0, 0.04362663, 0.00508018]",women,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

The notion of curating as research offers useful suggestions on how to escape historically induced binary oppositions between theory and practice, the academic and the artistic. Moreover, curatorial research instigates critical questions on the significance of knowledge production in the context of public museums, particularly the relationship between research, display and museum audience. This article explores different notions of curatorial research as they emerge through current museological discourse. Three models of curatorial research are identified, each conveying a distinct – yet related – understanding of knowledge production through curatorial practice in the museum setting. The article then uses the exhibition In Between as a case to explore these models further. Building on the analysis of the case and the three models, a fourth research model is proposed. The new model is based on the concept of “boundary work”, emphasising the multiple epistemological contributions curatorial research entails as it traverses borders between the domains of science and culture, thereby blurring the distinctions between theory and practice, the discursive and the immersive, the systematic and the creative.","[0.06352963, 0.01134386, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01532545, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00809017, 0.01610873]",politics,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

Fisheries management in the lake is currently at a crossroads. The government abolished a co-management system in November 2015 and installed the military to temporary enforce management. The objective of this study was to explore how fishers envisage future management options by assessing past management regimes and analysing perceptions of alternative regimes. A total of 273 semi-structured interviews at six selected landing sites on LV in Uganda were conducted. Fishers targeted two dominant species, Nile perch, Lates niloticus (L.), mainly on motorised vessels representing the commercial fishers and dagaa, Rastrineobola argentea (Pellegrin), using both motorised and paddled vessels. The dominance of motorised fishing vessels depicted a consequence of the army operations and represents government priority to protect rather than regulate commercial fishing operations. Fishers mainly perceived regulations they knew about as effective, strongly opposed local governments as a management entity and assigned management to fisher groups as expected. The results support a management regime of key resource users organised by common interest groups to participate in decision-making and combined government structures to regulate and enforce sustainable fisheries measures.","[0.02343957, 0.0, 0.00639573, 0.0, 0.00991012, 0.0, 0.03606398, 0.0, 0.01666314, 0.00094556, 0.00416145, 0.00738081]",health_medicine,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Using administrative data from England, Finland, Ontario (Canada), Scotland and Sweden (with data from Victoria (Australia) and Iceland in supplementary analyses), the aim of this study was to investigate compliance with these guidelines and identify potential socioeconomic inequities in the timing of surgery before 1 and 3 years. Methods: All boys born in 2003-2011 with a diagnosis code of undescended testis and procedure codes indicating orchidopexy before their fifth birthday were identified from administrative health records. Trends in the proportion of orchidopexies performed before 1 and 3 years of age were investigated, as were socioeconomic inequities in adherence to the guidelines. Results: Across all jurisdictions, the proportion of orchidopexies occurring before the first birthday increased over the study period. By 2011, from 7·6 per cent (Sweden) to 27·9 per cent (Scotland) of boys had undergone orchidopexy by their first birthday and 71·5 per cent (Sweden) to 90·4 per cent (Scotland) by 3 years of age. There was limited evidence of socioeconomic inequities for orchidopexy before the introduction of guidelines (2008). Across all jurisdictions for boys born after 2008, there was consistent evidence of inequities in orchidopexy by the first birthday, favouring higher socioeconomic position.

The study aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on the lives of Quranic schoolboys, almudos , who beg on behalf of their teachers, chernos, in Guinea-Bissau. Methods Data were collected in July 2020 during a state of emergency. Data rest on semistructured interviews with 14 almudos and observations. The almudos , aged 12–16 years, were identified in the capital Bissau and the regional centre Gabú. Results Four interconnected themes were found. The first, hardship, was brought by the COVID-19 pandemic and caused by lockdown and police threats, resulting in a decrease in alms and hunger. The second, circumvention of calamity, included preventive measures the boys undertook and concerns with crowdedness impeding social distancing. Relations with others is the third theme. These had changed with sharply reduced contacts with neighbours and other providers of alms. The parents had more frequent telephone contact with their sons, and encouraged them to continue their studies. At the same time, the chernos and almudos passed more time together, and they dedicated more time than earlier to the studies and prayers. The fourth theme has to do with the boys’ concerns about their long-term aspirations—to complete their studies and become respected chernos , for which begging was seen as an integral part.

The protest started as a series of “town meetings” challenging the authorities’ framing of the collapse and its enormous impact on the state budget and the country’s economy as simply being a part of a “global financial storm” (Bernburg, 2016). The alternative frame that emerged at the meetings was that the crisis exposed misrepresentation, corruption, and privilege and thus called for mass civil action to create a pressure on the politics to reform (starting with the immediate resignation of the ruling, center-right government). During the unfolding of the financial crisis, in fall 2008, participation by the general public in the protest meetings grew rapidly and the expanding protest platform encouraged activists to perform increasingly radical acts of contention. Eventually, in January 2009, after a few, consecutive days of pots and pans protest, which attracted a quarter of the population of the country’s major urban area (Bernburg, 2015), the government resigned.","[0.0317191, 0.0, 0.06074759, 0.00448895, 0.01269003, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01520226, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01400043]",covid,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

This paper describes the study design, methodology, and methods along with lessons learned. In addition various methodological and ethical concerns are raised. A sequential mixed-methods design was applied. In Phase one (mapping) we used KIDSCREEN-27 to study how disabled children evaluate their QoL compared with the perspectives of their parents and those of non-disabled children and their parents. Using the Participation and environment measure we also studied parents’ perspectives of their children’s participation in different social contexts. Altogether 209 disabled children and their parents, and 335 children in a control group and their parents (paired reports) participated in phase one. Phase two (unpacking) consisted of 14 case studies with disabled children aged 8–18 years and focus groups with 21 disabled people aged 19–35 years.

Already in the second half of the 18th century, the Danish king initiated actions that aimed to improve the precarious situation of the Icelandic population. After independence in 1944, Iceland enjoyed the highest per capita support of the Marchall Plan (European Recovery Program) following World War II. Thereafter Iceland received aid and loans from the World Bank according to which Iceland was a developing country until 1976. In 1981, the Icelandic International Development Agency (Iceida) was established, substituting the office for Iceland´s Assistance to the Developing Countries, and since 2013 it is a formal member of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD. Iceida and now Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has in recent years been engaged in bilateral collaboration with mostly three countries, one of which is Malawi.

From early engagement within the fishing sector at the shores of Lake Malawi in the early 1990s, the focus of the collaboration in the area moved to health services, water-and-sanitation, primary education, and social sector initiatives, later expanded to district-wide support.

Although these ideas are central in several theoretical perspectives, they have largely gone untested. Here, we report a longitudinal examination of interest congruence (i.e., interest fit) across 12 years during the transition from education to the workforce. The study uses four methods to capture interest congruence and the drivers of fit change: growth models, latent congruence models, person and environment latent difference scores, and piecewise growth models based on environmental transitions. Each method uses a different lens to understand interest congruence in educational and work domains. Across methods, three results were typically found: (1) interest congruence improved over time in school and at work, (2) participants’ interests often predicted educational and work changes, and (3) participants’ interests rarely changed in response to their environment. These results support a dynamic conceptualization of fit and suggest that selection—rather than socialization—is the main mechanism through which individuals achieve better interest fit during young adulthood. Other implications are discussed for theory development and the applied use of interest assessments.","[0.04663267, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0044415, 0.03558333, 0.05423807, 0.01395502, 0.00048908, 0.0, 0.00921888, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 3.73807360e-06

However, these rankings fail to assess what is happening within the private sphere regarding gender equality. We argue that research on the interplay between the domestic and public spheres is important because these overlapping fields affect the lives of women and men differently. By focusing on the earnings of doctorate holders in Iceland, we aim to obtain a better understanding of the gendered meaning and implications of found earnings inequalities. Relying on longitudinal population register data, as well as 32 in-depth interviews with doctorate holders, we find that the men earn significantly more than the women. While the quantitative model only explains a small part of the inequality, the qualitative findings indicate that decisions made within the household, referred to as team play, negotiation, and choices, play a defining role in post-doctorate career development. We conclude that, despite the male breadwinner model being outdated in Icelandic society, some of its pillar thoughts still persist beneath the surface, keeping gender inequality within the household in place.","[0.03731637, 0.04116092, 0.00502927, 0.13369119, 0.0, 0.0179385, 0.01169954, 0.00126278, 0.00280236, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",women,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 3.39819016e-04

However, the Union of the European Football Associations (UEFA) was keen to continue playing despite the pandemic and staged matches played behind closed doors. Thus, UEFA provided the involved parties with a strict protocol of how to organise and conduct matches in order to protect players and staff from contracting the virus, as well as to limit the risk of spreading the virus. This study provides a visual auto-ethnographical account of a European qualifier match between the women´s national teams of Iceland and Sweden. The match took place in September 2020, in the midst of the second wave of the Covid pandemic which was sweeping through Europe at the time. This visual story illustrates how the Covid pandemic was experienced in a team working quarantine and how it affected the social organisation of the match as shown by established rules and recommendations for human conduct and manifested in new norms of behaviour. The visual story further highlights how the pandemic imposed unprecedented challenges for sport teams to settle the conflicting forces of how to withhold manifested and collective team rituals under such constrains, as for the social organisations, which had to make-up protocols, at short notice, in order to keep the virus at bay.

We conduct a quantitative analysis based on a nationally representative sample of 10,783 Icelandic adolescents (50.2% girls). We developed a scale measuring craftsmanship that we use to test several hypotheses regarding the role of craftsmanship in sport and education. Our findings provide a consistent empirical support for the theory of craftsmanship. First, they indicate that elements of the craftsmanship theory that have been identified by prior qualitative research go together as predicted to form a coherent theoretical construct and a measurement scale that is both reliable and valid. The craftsmanship scale therefore offers good opportunities for quantitative research in an area that has been exclusively qualitative. Second, our findings indicate that, as predicted, the craftsmanship approach makes schoolwork more meaningful and reduces general feelings of meaninglessness. Third, the findings show, as predicted, that the craftsmanship approach influences school performance in a positive way. Fourth, we find that the positive relationship between sport participation and school performance is in part mediated by craftsmanship.

However, the literature to date on glacier ES has lacked a systematic analysis of their type and the various stages in the formation of glacier ES, including the linkages between biophysical structures and ecological processes to human values, benefits and well-being. This paper begins to fill this gap by (1) detailing the first Common International Classification for Ecosystem Services classification of ES specific to glaciers; and (2) constructing an ES cascade model specific to the ES of glaciers, integrating four main stages of co-production: value attribution, mobilisation of ES potential, value appropriation, and commercialisation. In both stages, examples from the academic and grey literature are highlighted. Based on a systematic literature review, a total of 15 ES are identified, categorised as follows: provisioning (2), regulation and maintenance (6), and cultural (7). Apart from abiotic regulation and maintenance ES, it is evident that human interventions are necessary in order to mobilise, appropriate and commercialise several glacier ES, including freshwater for drinking, hydropower generation, recreation and education. Rapidly intensifying climate change has led to intense focus on the initial co-production process of value attribution and identification of dynamic ES potential, with a view to maximising commercial b

We employed a mixed-methods design to explore and compare parent perspectives on (1) participation of children with and without autism spectrum disorder in activities at home, (2) the environmental features and resources that affect these children’s home participation and (3) the strategies parents use to help their children participate at home. The Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth (PEM-CY) was used to gather online survey and qualitative data from parents of 99 high-functioning children with autism spectrum disorder and 241 children without autism spectrum disorder. Independent sample t-tests and χ² tests were used to explore differences between groups, and Cohen’s d was calculated to examine effect sizes. Differences were obtained on all Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth dimensions but particularly when comparing parents’ satisfaction and perceived environmental barriers to their children’s participation. The qualitative analyses revealed that parents in both groups used similar strategies to facilitate their children’s participation at home, although parents of children with autism spectrum disorder made use of more distinct modifications. Our results highlight the importance of environmental aspects and point to how practitioners can support families in their efforts to promote their child’s participation at home.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01125729, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.30381553, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",child_family,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 4.75203870e-04

Successful senior women academics in feminist and other critical disciplines were asked about their experiences within the academic system, how they thrived in the neoliberal academy while practicing feminist scholarship and activism. They revealed how they paid the price for unmasking the rules of the game and working the cracks within the system. Based on their experiences the new generation of feminist activists in academia is encouraged to B-E-L-I-E-F.

A survey was conducted to evaluate the disposition of respondents to the relative prioritisation of security over civil liberties. The results indicate that even in a rather secure setting, where threats from terror can be considered relatively distant, citizens have a disposition towards prioritising security, although this depends on the degree of anxiety, political trust and general social trust. Anxiety leads to greater willingness to accept infringements, as does trust in government while general social trust leads to smaller receptiveness in this respect.","[0.0299299177, 5.01425878e-05, 0.0175187537, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.013760366, 0.0, 0.00413570654, 0.00929183966, 0.0, 0.0]",politics,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Method: The Uni-Search and five additional databases were searched. Children's health issues were grouped into psychosocial issues including autism and ADHD, and physical and performance issues including pain. Measures used for comparison were those addressing (a) psychosocial functioning, (b) physical and performance functioning, and (c) health-related quality of life. Results: Totally, 39 studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 44 analyses in all since four studies contained more than one analyses. Moderate child-parent agreement was demonstrated in 23 analyses and poor agreement in 20 analyses. Several analyses found more agreement on observable/external than on non-observable/internal domains. Overall, parents considered their children had more difficulties than did the children themselves, although there were indications that for children with physical performance issues, parents may underreport their children's difficulties in emotional functioning and pain. There were no consistencies in differences between children's and parent's ratings on levels of agreement with respect to the children's health issue, age or gender.

First, a statistical analysis on the Icelandic Premier Football League was made in order to evaluate the frequency of managerial succession and job-tenure of football managers. Second, interviews with football managers and various football related resources were used to gain a more adequate understanding for the reasons and consequences of managerial succession in football. The findings show that the job of the football manager is complex and problematic and that managerial succession is frequent in contemporary football. In-season managerial changes are made when team efficiency is low and the findings also actuate the importance of the football managers for their clubs since results tend to improve considerably for low-efficient teams that make in-season managerial change. The findings further suggest that football managers experience what Merton described as ´anomie´ in their jobs. The cultural goals in contemporary sports are out of reach for most football clubs with the structural means provided. Finally, it is argued that ´anomie´ is one of the main reasons for frequent managerial succession in contemporary football.","[0.01338253, 0.00015227, 0.0, 0.00214729, 0.00148548, 0.00550385, 0.01222121, 0.0, 0.01115707, 0.01364248, 0.00485859, 0.01375961]",politics,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

It has, however, not proven to be a simple solution to improve their governance; hence, most African inland fisheries are still experiencing unsustainable overexploitation of their resources. As such, there is a need for reassessing the application of governance strategies for co-management that should strive to strengthen the participation of stakeholders, primarily the local fishers, as they are fundamental in the governance of fisheries resources. Therefore, this study set out to explore the prospects of a co-management governance approach at a Lake Itezhi-Tezhi small-scale fishery in Zambia. Focus group discussions with fishers and semi-structured interviews with other stakeholders were used to collect data. This study revealed that the stakeholders perceive co-management as a feasible approach to governance of the Lake Itezhi-Tezhi fishery. However, the feasibility of the co-management arrangement would be dependent mostly on the stakeholders’ ability to address most of the ‘key conditions’ criteria highlighted in the study.

The core purpose of these projects is to understand why parents with primarily intellectual disabilities encounter such difficulties with the child protection system. Our aim with this contribution is to identify, through a longitudinal and comparative framework, why these difficulties persist despite a changing disability rights environment. A case study methodology has been employed highlighting three cases, one from each research project, which focus narrowly on disabled parents’ struggles with the child protection system in the context of the maternity ward. The findings, framed in the concept of structural violence, indicate poor working practices on the part of healthcare and child protection, a lack of trust, and that context is still ignored in favour of disability as the explanatory framework for the perceived inadequacies of the parents. We contend that child protection authorities continue to remain out of step with developments in disability and human rights.

There is a need to advance knowledge on PA governance systems, like co-management, recognising that there is no ""one-size-fits-all"" solution. We analyse the co-management governance system and performance of Vatnajökull National Park (VNP), Iceland. We adapt an analytical framework from the literature on environmental governance and analyse its governance system, hence actor roles, institutional arrangements and interactions. Our findings illustrate that the co-management structure was an outcome of political negotiations and a response to the lack of legitimacy of its predecessors; resulting in a tailor-made governance system set out in park-specific legislation. Although the performance is quite positive, being adaptive to changes, inclusive, promoting rural development and an appreciated facilitator of devolution and power-sharing, it has come with challenges. It has encountered problems delineating responsibilities among its actors, causing conflict and confusion; in settling conflicting localised issues close to local stakeholders, there have been capacity issues. We argue that the VNP co-management system is fit for its purpose, aligned with Icelandic land-use governance structures but in need of systematic improvements. There are important lessons as Iceland seeks to expand its PA estate and beyond, since the global community is setting ambitious policy goals t

The whey did nothing for him. Not surprising considering that two years later he died of a cancer from which he was in all likelihood already suffering. A family from Hamburg stayed in the room directly above him, a Mr. Mai, his wife, and their young daughter. Andersen kept company with them, among other guests in the spa, and on Thursday, May 29, he records in his diary: The weather doesn’t look promising today either. I slept with many interruptions, but slept nonetheless. My ringworm itches constantly and I have many small liver spots on my legs, what does that mean?

I told him it was a Danish folktale and that Grimm had never composed a fairy tale, he was only a collector… I am not in a good mood. ""What the Old Man Does Is Always Right"" appeared in 1861 in the second series of Andersen’s New Fairy Tales and Stories.
