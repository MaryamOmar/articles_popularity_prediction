PWE-103 Positive nutritional outcomes in patients receiving home parenteral nutrition (hpn) with palliative malignancy: a uk single centre series,"['Rebecca Whitefield', 'R Iriarte', 'H Bridgestock[...]', 'NE Burch']","Introduction HPN use in those with malignant bowel obstruction or palliative cancer is relatively commonplace. The 2009 ESPEN guidelines advise consideration if tumour related prognosis is 2–3 months, where TPN is expected to improve or stabilise performance status and/or quality of life. To review our practice we undertook a retrospective audit of all palliative HPN discharges over 4 years. Method Retrospective audit of all palliative HPN discharges between October 2012 and November 2016 from UHCW. Data collected included: diagnosis, demographics, nutritional and biochemical parameters, estimated prognosis, complications, and outcome. Outcomes were collected up to 31st January 2017. Results 17 patients were identified; age 36–79 (mean 57); 59% female. Diagnosis included: malignant GI tract obstruction (n=12; 70%); malignant enterocutaneous fistulae (n=2; 12%); and malabsorption/autonomic dysfunction (n=3; 18%). Estimated prognosis was documented in 11/17 (65%):>3 months in 4 (36%); 3–6 months in 2 (18%);>6 months in 3 (27%), and >12 months in 2 (18%). 9/17 (53%) received chemotherapy alongside TPN. Weight at start of PN was 46.4–94.5 kg (mean 63.7); BMI 16.3–34.6 (mean 21.8); weight loss 0%–32% (mean 12.5%) prior to referral. 7/17 (42%) patients were alive at analysis. Of these, 3/17 (18%) had discontinued HPN due to resolution of intestinal failure, and 4/17 (24%) continuned HPN. Duration of HPN was 6.5–21 months (mean 13.4) in those with resolution, and 13.3–18 months (mean 15) in those continuing HPN. The remaining 10 patients (59%) had died; duration of HPN in this group was 0.3–29.1 months (mean 6.5). 12/17 patients (71%) survived longer than their estimated prognosis

The beef with vegans: Managing stigma in Britain's hegemonic meat culture,['Hannah Howard'],"As one of the fastest growing lifestyle choices, veganism is a diet, lifestyle and social movement motivated by animal rights, environmental protection and human health. Veganism is considered socially deviant from the hegemonic meat culture of the UK and so vegans often receive stigma when expressing this element of their identity. This study aimed to critically examine how vegans manage stigma dependent on the social and spatial context. Semi-structured interviews with 20 vegans in northwest England revealed that vegans employ four main strategies to manage stigma: acceptance, avoidance, reduction and denial. The chosen management technique was determined by a stigmatised individual's acceptance or rejection of public understandings of the stigma and the applicability of the stigma to the self. Social and spatial context were often emphasised by participants, with many vegans communicating a need to adapt their management techniques in accordance with the situation-often employing elements of different strategies simultaneously. The study thus highlights the idea of stigma as a social construct that is shifting and wide-ranging.",Article,,,,0,"

Gender-based Violence in Sport: Prevalence and Problems,"['Melanie Lang', 'Lut Mergaert', 'Tine Vertommen', 'Catarina Arnaut']","Little is known about the prevalence of gender-based violence (GBV) in sport in European Union (EU) Member States (MS). The research question underpinning this study was therefore: What is the nature and extent of gender-based violence in sport in the EU? The study involved a scoping exercise that mapped existing research on the incidence and/or prevalence of any/all form(s) of GBV in sport. This was complemented by interviews with key stakeholders within each EU MS. Forty-one studies were identified across 17 countries. Of these, none investigated the whole range of behaviours that constitute GBV, so the prevalence of GBV in sport in EU MS is unknown. The most commonly studied form of GBV was sexual harassment, which had a reported prevalence rate of between 1% and 64% due to different methodologies and definitions. This variation is indicative of the challenges of studying GBV, which are discussed in this paper. Without clear prevalence rates for of (all forms of) GBV, prevention efforts cannot be efficiently targeted and the effectiveness of interventions cannot be assessed. Among others, we recommend the European Commission contract regular research in sport that uses a standardized definition of GBV and a common methodological approach.",Article,1 , European Journal for Sport and Society,Nov 10,0,"

Depression in adolescent obesity: Cultural moderators of the association between obesity and depressive symptoms,"['J Wardle', 'S Williamson', 'Fiona Johnson', 'C Edwards']","Community studies relating depression to obesity in adolescents have generated inconsistent results. It has been argued that the variability in findings is due to effect modification by demographic characteristics that vary across samples. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the strength of the obesity-depression association is moderated by gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES). Data were from two large, school-based, studies of adolescent health and well-being (n=4320; n=1824). Students completed one of two measures of depressive symptoms (SDQ; CES-D) in school and were weighed and measured. Gender and ethnicity were self-reported and SES was indexed by residential neighbourhood characteristics or individual family deprivation. There was barely any association between obesity and depressive symptoms in either sample. There was also no evidence that obese participants who were female, white or from higher SES backgrounds were especially vulnerable to depressive symptoms. The results indicate that in community samples of adolescents, regardless of gender, SES or ethnicity, reports of depressive symptoms are not significantly higher in obese than normal-weight groups. The results are discussed in terms of obese adolescents' resilience in the face of multiple social adversities.",Article,6 , International Journal of Obesity,,0,"

Child-centred Framing Through Design Research: A Framework For Analysing Children’s ‘Dream Wheelchair’ Designs to Elicit Meaning and Elevate Their Voice,"['Cara Shaw', 'Francesca Bernardi', 'Farnaz Nickpour']","PREPRINT: This paper considers the possibilities of analysing children’s own designs to contribute to inclusive paediatric mobility design. The aim of this paper is threefold: (1) to develop a framework for child-centred design analysis, (2) to analyse children’s designs to explore both quantitative and qualitative insights and (3) to explore how children’s voice could be elevated through design research. A Child-centred Design Analysis Framework is developed in an interdisciplinary manner, comprising four dimensions including Child, Content, Context and Format. It is used as a vehicle to analyse and code 130 ‘Dream Wheelchair’ designs by children. The children’s ‘Dream Wheelchair’ designs reference a range of features and priorities, which are gathered into themes through the framework, providing insights into children’s individual and collective mobility narratives, values and requirements. Themes are explored through a qualitative interdisciplinary lens to understand the nature of children’s lived experiences. The framework promotes child-centred framing through extracting meaning from children’s own designs. It is suggested that child-centred framing and a rights-respecting approach to assistive technology design research can lead to more appropriate design outcomes and improved user experiences for children with disabilities.",Article,,,Aug 4,1,"

Hallmarks of the Political in Community Organizing: An Arendtian Perspective,['Paul Bunyan'],"Drawing upon Hannah Arendt’s adherence to existential phenomenology, the article advances a political understanding and interpretation of community organizing. Arendt, it is maintained, offers valuable insight into political phenomena which are constitutive of community organizing. Four aspects, in particular, are highlighted—what I refer to as the four “A”s of association, action, appearance and authenticity—understood in existentialist, phenomenological, ontological and ultimately political terms, as primary ways of being-together-politically . The first part of the article examines Arendt’s existential phenomenological approach in shaping her understanding of the political. This provides the theoretical basis for examining in the second part of the article, phenomena which are constitutive of community organizing, highlighting how association, action, appearance and authenticity form distinctive political characteristics of community organizing as an approach. At different points, brief reference is made to the work of London Citizens, the largest broad-based organization in the UK, in order to illustrate the connections between Arendtian thought and community-based organizing.",Article,1 , International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations,,0,"

Psychosocial aspects of weight control and weight concern in adolescent girls,['Fiona Johnson'],"The increasing prevalence of obesity has been described as a 'global epidemic' (WHO 2000), leading to calls for individuals to make changes to their dietary behaviours and physical activity levels. As the same time there is concern about the harmful effects of excessive weight concerns and dietary restriction, particularly amongst young women. Many girls who control their weight experience high levels of psychological distress and a small number go on to develop eating disorders. This thesis uses data from a survey of 1177 adolescent girls, which incorporates a one- year follow-up of the sample, to examine social and psychological factors which predispose individuals to weight control attempts. It aims to distinguish aspects of weight control associated with harmful levels of distress from those which lead to healthy lifestyle changes, examining the contribution of intensity of dieting, involvement in specific weight control practices, dietary restraint and body dissatisfaction in order to investigate which are the most harmful aspects of weight control. Weight control and dietary restraint has been associated with a number of detrimental psychological and behavioural outcomes, including depression, low self esteem and bulimic binge eating. Results presented here, however, suggest that these outcomes may be more closely associated with the high levels of body dissatisfaction found in dieters, and that the direct effects of weight control behaviours may not be as strong as has been claimed. They also suggest that the sub-group of dieters who practice only healthy, recommended methods of weight control do not exhibit many of the negative psychological and behavioural characteristics of dieters.

Aetiology and outcome of paediatric cardiopulmonary arrest,"['Laura R. van Banning', 'Ca Allison']","Paediatric cardiopulmonary arrest is an uncommon event in the general population but is not infrequent in the paediatric hospital setting. This article looks at the causes of arrests in children, the likely outcomes, and the ways in which this can be improved. In-hospital cardiac arrest has improving outcomes, while out-of-hospital arrest outcome remains poor and most recent research supports the vital importance of quality of CPR and measures to ensure favourable outcomes. Extracorporeal resuscitation is an emerging modality for in-hospital cardiac arrest and has increasing literature to support its use in specific circumstances as well as the impact of shorter time to initiation on quality outcomes. The coronavirus pandemic has reminded us of the resuscitation and airway implications of communicable disease, which we should be consider in context of outcome results.",Article,0 , Anaesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine,Jan 27,0,"

Self-management programmes for adult patients with bronchiectasis: a systematic review and realist synthesis,"['Anthony Tsang', 'Dave Andrew Lynes', 'Hayley McKenzie[...]', 'Carol Kelly']","Purpose Self-management for patients with bronchiectasis has been identified as an important component that could potentially empower patients to manage their condition and improve their quality of life. Evidence was reviewed to investigate what self-management programmes work, why and in what circumstances. Methods A systematic review and realist synthesis were conducted. A comprehensive database search was performed on seven databases for evidence published up to July 2021. Leading candidate self-management programmes identified from the systematic review became the focus of the realist synthesis. A realist logic of analysis was applied to produce explanatory context-mechanism-outcome configurations. These explanations were consolidated into programme theories drawing on health behaviour change theory. Results By synthesising the data from eight eligible articles, programme theories articulated how three different self-management programmes work that included: (i) education and action planning, (ii) education and airway clearance techniques (ACT) and, (iii) education, exercise and ACT. Patient characteristics and collaborative partnership between healthcare professionals and patients were identified as important contexts that influenced the improvement in self-efficacy, health-related quality of life, and exercise capacity. Conclusions This review contributes to a better understanding of how the complex interaction between contexts and mechanisms can improve outcomes of clinical interest. • IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION • This evidence synthesis has identified potentially important combinations of interventions to be considered in self-management prog

Functional outcome of early weight bearing for acute Achilles tendon rupture treated conservatively in a weight-bearing orthosis,"['Rajib Naskar', 'L. Oliver', 'Patricia Velazquez-Ruta[...]', 'C. Southgate']","Background The optimal management for Achilles tendon (AT) ruptures is controversial and still continues to encourage debate. Conventionally, operative repair was favoured secondary to its lower rates of re-rupture, however in more recent years, we have seen promising results and a reduction in complications with conservative management. One reason for this improvement may be due to the introduction of a functional weight-bearing orthosis, however, results for complete AT ruptures is still unclear. This study aims to evaluate the functional outcomes of early weight bearing in a functional orthosis for conservatively managed, complete AT ruptures. Methodology This study was done at East Kent Hospital University Foundation Trust in between 2019−2020. In this prospective study, we have analysed data from 41 patients with US diagnosed compete AT ruptures, with gap less than 5 cm. Every patient was treated in a functional weight-bearing orthosis (VACOped) for 8 weeks with early weight-bearing following a specific treatment protocol, followed by rehabilitation with a trained physiotherapist. All patients received a final follow-up at 1 year post injury, where we recorded the following functional outcome measurements on each leg: calf girth, single leg heel raise height, single leg heel raise repetitions and the ATRS score. Result Our study population was predominantly male with an average age of 50 (range 22−79). The majority of the cohort were physically active, with more than 75% involved in a form of sporting activity pre-injury and 15% involved in higher level activity and competitive sport. The mean ATRS score was 82.1, with a re-rupture rate of only 2%. The average calf bulk difference was 1.6 cm, average heel raise height dif

State violence and the colonial roots of collusion in Northern Ireland,['Mark Mcgovern'],"This article considers the nature of collusion between the British state and loyalist paramilitary organisations during the conflict in Northern Ireland in the context of British counterinsurgency theory and practices in prior colonial campaigns. It briefly outlines the nature, pattern and logic of collusion in Northern Ireland before examining some of the key works of British counterinsurgency theorists – Charles Callwell, Charles Gwynn and Frank Kitson – reflecting on earlier imperial experiences. Collusion is understood as an expedient coercive state practice, premised on a ‘doctrine of necessity’, designed to remove ‘enemies’ and induce fear in a target population via a strategy of assassination in which the appearance of adherence to the rule of law is a political end shaping the specific forms of state violence involved. Such a practice, the author argues, is not an aberration in the tradition of British state counterinsurgency violence, it is exemplary.",Article,5 , Race & Class,Jun 3,0,"

Navigating the shifting sands of filtering facepiece respirator provision during the COVID-19 pandemic: A system response for maximising staff safety,"['Ca Allison', 'Mike Tennant', 'Peter Xiang[...]', 'Niall Wilton']","Introduction Personal protective equipment is essential to protect health workers and patients and to ensure confidence when dealing with aerosolised disease transmission. We describe the process for ensuring adequate filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) qualitative fit testing at a local level during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Cascaded training is described, which allowed rapid spreading of the testing process, with supervision allowing quality assurance throughout. Testing consisted of subjective ‘fit checking’, checking for leaks, followed by qualitative hood testing. Results The original respirators (3M 1870) had a hood test pass rate of 87.5%. Following identification of this as a non-renewable and unsustainable option, a domestically manufactured and sustainable Help-It P2 duckbill-type respirator was adopted as the primary FFR. The hood test pass rate for this respirator was only 54%. A third respirator was made available (3M 1860), with a high pass rate of 80% but also a limited and non-renewable resource. Algorithms were constructed highlighting different proportional use of the respirators depending on the most limited resource. Conclusion The testing format used is simple, reproducible and can be used by any hospital organisation when occupational health and safety departments are unable to provide the service during overwhelming demand. Qualitative fit testing is a scalable and effective method for ensuring appropriately sized and shaped FFRs, minimising resource consumption in the process. The use of a product with appropriate filtration capacity but a lower fit test pass rate (domestic duckbill respirator) as a replaceable resource facilitated adequate respirator availability for staff that would ot

Setting 193 Australian general practices in Western Australia and New South Wales participating in the MedicineInsight programme run by NPS MedicineWise. Participants 22 791 patients aged 18 and above with T2DM. Interventions Regularity was assessed based on variation in the number of days between GP visits, with more regular contacts assumed to indicate planned, proactive care. Informational continuity (claims for care planning incentives) and relational continuity (usual provider of care index) were assessed separately. Outcome measures Process of care indicators were glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) test underuse (8 months without test), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) underuse (14 months) and HbA1c overuse (two tests within 80 days). The clinical indicator was T2DM control (HbA1c 6.5% (47.5 mmol/mol)–7.5% (58.5 mmol/mol)). Results The quintile with most regular contact had reduced odds of HbA1c and eGFR underuse (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.81 and OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.86, respectively), but increased odds of HbA1c overuse (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.38).

"Development of the Top Tips Habit-Based Weight Loss App and Preliminary Indications of Its Usage, Effectiveness, and Acceptability: Mixed-Methods Pilot Study","['Nathalie Kliemann', 'Helen Croker', 'Fiona Johnson', 'Rebecca J Beeken']","Background: The Ten Top Tips (10TT) is an intervention based on the habit formation theory that promotes a set of weight management behaviors alongside advice about repetition in a consistent context. Overall, 3 studies have demonstrated that the 10TT can support individuals to lose weight when delivered in a leaflet format. Delivery of 10TT via new technology such as a mobile app could potentially improve its effectiveness and make it more convenient, appealing, and wide reaching. Objective: This study aimed to provide preliminary indications of the usage, effectiveness, and acceptability of an Android app of the 10TT intervention (Top Tips only app) and a second version including self-regulatory strategies for dealing with tempting foods (Top Tips plus app). Methods: The 3-month pilot randomized adults with overweight or obesity to (1) Top Tips only app, (2) Top Tips plus app, or (3) waiting list condition. Automated data from app users were collected. Validated questionnaires assessed self-regulatory skills, weight loss (kg), and behaviors at baseline and 3 months. Users’ feedback on their experience using the app was assessed using open questions. Results: A total of 81 participants took part in the pilot; 28 participants were randomized to the Top Tips only app, 27 to the Top Tips plus app, and 26 to the waiting list condition. On average, participants viewed a mean of 43.4 (SD 66.9) screens during a mean of 24.5 (SD 44.07) log-ins and used the app for 124.2 (SD 240.2) min over the 3-month period.

Effectiveness of Telehealth in Rural and Remote Emergency Departments: A Systematic Review (Preprint),"['Christina Tsou', 'Suzanne Robinson', 'James H Boyd[...]', 'Delia Hendrie']","BACKGROUND Emergency telehealth has been used to improve rural and remote patients’ access to specialist care in the hope of mitigating the significant health disparities experienced by people living in these locations. Patient disposition decisions in rural and remote emergency departments (ED) can be complex and largely dependent on the expertise and experience available to local (receiving-end) hospitals. Whilst there has been some synthesis of evidence on the effectiveness of emergency telehealth on clinical practice in the rural and remote EDs for non-acute presentations, there has been limited evaluation of the influence of contextual factors such as clinical areas and acuity of presentations on these findings. OBJECTIVE This systematic review examined the outcome measures used in studying the effectiveness of rural and remote emergency telehealth and analyzed the clinical context in which these outcome measures were used and interpreted. METHODS The search strategy used medical subject headings (MeSH) and equivalent lists of subject descriptors to find articles covering four key domains: telehealth/telemedicine, emergency department(s), effectiveness, rural and remote. According to the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome(s) of interest, and Study design (PICOS) framework, studies were selected. This search strategy was applied to MEDLINE (Ovid), Cochrane Library, Scopus, CINAHL, ProQuest, EconLit, and the CRD databases (e.g. NHS Economic Evaluation Database) for the search period of 1st January 1990 to 23rd May 2020.

"Variety, Palatability, and Obesity","['Fiona Johnson', 'Jane Wardle']","Among the key characteristics of the Western obesogenic food environment is a highly palatable and varied food supply. Laboratory investigations of eating behavior in both humans and animals established key roles for palatability and variety in stimulating appetite, delaying satiety, and promoting excessive energy intake. There is a robust effect of food palatability and variety on short-term food intake, and increased variety and palatability also cause weight gain in animal models. However, laboratory paradigms do not replicate the complexities of eating in a natural setting, and there is a shortage of evidence to estimate the magnitude of effects on weight in humans. There are substantial individual differences in susceptibility to the palatability effect and this may be a key determinant in individual vulnerability to weight gain. The understanding of pathways through which palatability and variety can affect eating is advancing, and epidemiologic and intervention studies are needed to translate laboratory findings into applications in public health or clinical domains, and to establish whether there is a role for greater regulation of the food environment in tackling increases in obesity.",Literature Review,,,,0,"

We aim to quantify the impact of this outbreak on shoulder and elbow trauma in our institution. Methods We prospectively collected data on patients presenting to our hospital with shoulder and elbow injuries during COVID-19. This included the number of attendances to the emergency department, fracture clinic, inpatient admissions and operative treatments. This was compared to a pre-COVID-19 period. We also assessed the efficacy of telephone clinics. Results There has been a noticeable decrease in the number of emergency department and fracture clinic attendances with upper limb complaints. The number of in-person fracture clinic reviews also decreased, with a reciprocal exponential increase in telephone consultations. We recorded a decrease in the number of shoulder and elbow trauma procedures performed. There was a small increase in the proportion of injuries treated conservatively during COVID-19. Our telephone clinics yielded a diagnosis and management plan in many cases and patient perspective appeared favourable. Conclusion We have noted significant change in the upper limb caseload.

What Can Be Learnt From 130 Children's Dream Wheelchair Designs? Eliciting Child-centred Insights Using An Interdisciplinary Design Analysis Framework,"['Cara Shaw', 'Farnaz Nickpour', 'Francesca Bernardi']","The design of inclusive paediatric mobility (IPM) interventions, such as children's wheelchairs, are entangled with technological, health and social considerations. As narratives around childhood, disability and mobility shift and transform, these entanglements evolve. In order to optimise the experience of childhood mobility, IPM designers must understand and respond to such changes and channel children's own requirements, desires and 'dreams' into the design process; this can be achieved by utilising a child-centred design approach. This paper identifies meaningful child-centred IPM design insights and opportunities through the interdisciplinary analysis of 130 dream wheelchair designs by disabled children, aged 4 to 17 years. A novel interdisciplinary and child-centred design analysis framework is developed to dissect, categorise and code the topics and features expressed through visuals and written descriptions in each of the children's dream wheelchair designs. Children's mobility narratives, desires and requirements are elicited and trending topics are discussed. It is proposed that valuing children's voices in the IPM design process could alter both the process of designing IPM interventions as well as the product outcomes.",Article,,,Aug 16,0,"

Use of PEG-rHuMGDF in platelet engraftment after autologous stem cell transplantation,"['Karen K Fields', 'M Crump', 'I Bence-Bruckler[...]', 'Michael Lill']","This paper summarizes a pilot, sequential dose-escalation study of PEG-rHuMGDF in patients with advanced malignancies who had delayed platelet recovery after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Patients were randomized to receive either placebo (n = 11) or PEG-rHuMGDF at 5 (n = 9), 10 (n = 6), or 25 (n = 7) microg/kg/day by subcutaneous injection for 14 days and were monitored for 5 weeks. Across all treatment groups, eight patients had platelet recovery to > or = 20 x 10(9)/l by day 21. The proportion of patients achieving platelet recovery, the median number of days and units of platelet transfusions were similar for the placebo and the PEG-rHuMGDF groups. PEG-rHuMGDF was well tolerated at all dosages. The incidence rates of adverse events in all groups were similar. No deaths on study, no drug-related serious adverse events, and no development of neutralizing antibodies to MGDF occurred.",Article,0 , Bone Marrow Transplantation,Nov 25,1,"

Assessing socioeconomic status in adolescents: the validity of a home affluence scale,"['J Wardle', 'Kathryn Robb', 'Fiona Johnson']","To examine the completion rate, internal reliability, and external validity of a home affluence scale based on adolescents' reports of material circumstances in the home as a measure of family socioeconomic status. Cross sectional survey. Data were collected from a school based study in seven schools in the north of England Cheshire over a five month period from September 1999 to January 2000. 1824 students (1248 girls, 567 boys) aged 13-15 years who were attending normal classes in Years 9 and 10 in 7 schools on the days of data collection. Main results: Comparatively poor completion rates were found for questions on parental education and occupation while material deprivation items had much higher completion rates. There was evidence that students with poorer material circumstances were less able to report parental education and occupation whereas material based questions showed less bias. A home affluence scale composed of material items was found to have adequate internal reliability and good external validity. A home affluence scale based on material markers provides a useful alternative in assessing family affluence in adolescents. Additionally, it prevents exclusion of those less materially well off adolescents who fail to complete conventional socioeconomic status items.",Article,2 , Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,,1,"

Brief ‘Appetitive Trait Tailored Intervention’: Development in a Sample of Adults with Overweight and Obesity,"['Claudia Hunot-Alexander', 'Helen Croker', 'Alison Fildes[...]', 'Rebecca J Beeken']","Appetitive traits are associated with weight and could be managed using behavioural strategies. Personalised approaches to weight loss could use a person's appetitive trait profile to tailor weight management advice. This study aimed to explore participants’ experiences of a brief Appetitive Trait Tailored Intervention (ATTI) based on participants’ Adult Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (AEBQ) scores. The ATTI was developed using strategies from modified Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and behaviour change techniques. Acceptability testing of the ATTI was carried out with participants (body mass index ≥25) who completed the AEBQ online and were sent their appetitive trait profile and corresponding weight loss tips via e-mail. Participants were asked to follow the tips for 8 weeks and following the tips, perceived helpfulness, barriers, and initial and final body weight. Qualitative interviews explored their experiences. Thirty-seven participants provided feedback and reported the majority of the tips to be helpful. Thirty-two participants (92.5% female) provided their final weight; 10 reported weight loss ≥5% of initial weight. Qualitative interviews (n = 21) revealed that tailoring was seen as novel and participants felt that the ATTI increased their self-awareness and encouraged behavioural changes. The low intensity of the ATTI limited engagement for some. The ATTI is an acceptable, novel approach to weight management.",Article,1 , Behaviour Change,Nov 3,0,"

Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of TeleStroke consultations to support the care of patients who had a stroke presenting to regional emergency departments in Western Australia: an economic evaluation case study protocol,"['Christina Tsou', 'Suzanne Robinson', 'James H Boyd[...]', 'Delia Hendrie']","Introduction The Western Australia (WA) Acute TeleStroke Programme commenced incrementally across regional WA during 2016–2017. Since the introduction of the TeleStroke Programme, there has been monitoring of service outputs, including regional patient access to tertiary stroke specialist advice and reperfusion treatment; however, the impact of consultation with a stroke specialist via telehealth (videoconferencing or telephone) on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of stroke care and the drivers of cost-effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. Methods and analysis The aim of the case study was to examine the impact of consultation with a stroke specialist via telehealth on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of stroke and transient ischaemic attack care using a mixed methods approach. A categorical decision tree model will be constructed in collaboration with clinicians and programme managers. A before and after comparison using state-wide administrative datasets will be used to run the base model. If sample size and statistical power permits, the cases and comparators will be matched by stroke type and presence of CT scan at the initial site of presentation, age category and presenting hospital. The drivers of cost-effectiveness will be explored through stakeholder interviews. Data from the qualitative analysis will be cross-referenced with trends emerging from the quantitative dataset and used to guide the factors to be involved in subgroup and sensitivity analysis. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval for this case study has been granted from the Western Australian Country Health Service Human Research and Ethics Committee (RGS3076). Reciprocal approval

519Innovative use of MedicineInsight GP database for applied research on antibiotic prescribing in Western Australia,"['Amy Harrison', 'Suzanne Robinson', 'Linda Selvey[...]', 'Mark N. Harris']","Focus of Presentation This project showcases the use of existing general practice (GP) datasets to gain access to large-scale data for epidemiological research. There is limited quantitative research on antibiotic prescribing in Australian GP. The research question involves identifying predictors of antibiotic prescribing not in accordance with national therapeutic guidelines for urinary tract infection (UTI) in Western Australian (WA) GP. This requires large-scale, individual-level data, which is difficult to access in Australia, and in this case could not be achieved without collaboration. Findings Longitudinal records from 52 practices in WA participating in MedicineInsight were analyzed. GP datasets present challenges regarding cleaning, processing and storage. Substantial broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing was identified in initial episodes of UTI, particularly for children, and not supported by laboratory pathology. Children received broad-spectrum antibiotics 85% of the time, compared to 58% in women. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to elucidate patient- and consultation-related factors associated with antibiotic prescribing outside of the guidelines. Conclusions/Implications There is evidence of antibiotic prescribing outside of the guidelines for initial presentations of UTI in WA GP. Whilst GP datasets provide insightful information on antibiotic prescribing, it is important to explore these findings with practising clinicians to further understand the drivers behind this behaviour, and this is the next stage of this research. Key messages Collaborative partnerships can facilitate access to rich, large-scale datasets capable of answering important research questions in Australian primary care.",Article,1 , International Journal of Epidemiology,,0,"

The EU diaspora in the UK cannot be ignored (LSE Brexit),"['Zana Vathi', 'Ruxandra Trandafoiu']","While formally Brexit may be behind us, the EU diaspora in the UK is becoming a political actor Brexiters could not foresee, write Zana Vathi and Ruxandra Trandafoiu (Edge Hill University). They argue that a 'civic' Europeanness was activated by Brexit and has started to create bridges among Europeans in the UK who are emerging as a dynamic diaspora collective of political significance. The promises made by the UK government to EU nationals in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 Referendum have not been fulfilled. Instead, they were quickly replaced with the lengthy bureaucracy of the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) and the stark choice of continued residence in the UK under tougher conditions or return to the countries of origin. What Brexiters and the UK government did not foresee was the powerful mix of geopolitical interests and emotional stakes shared by EU nationals, who bonded together to become political actors in their own right, across linguistic and cultural differences.",Article,,,,0,"

Phase 1 study of pegylated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEG-rHuMGDF) in breast cancer patients after autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation,"['B.J. Bolwell', 'J Vredenburgh', 'Beth Overmoyer[...]', 'J Glaspy']","Forty-seven patients with stage II, III, or IV breast cancer undergoing autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation were randomized to placebo (n = 13) or to one of five sequential dose cohorts of pegylated (PEG) recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEG-rHuMGDF) (1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, or 10.0 microg/kg/day) (n= 34). Blinded study drug was started on the day of transplantation and was continued until the platelet count was > or =100 x 109/l or a maximum of 21 days. PBPCs were mobilized with filgrastim (r-metHuG-CSF) and all patients received filgrastim starting on day +2 after transplantation. The nadir platelet count was not affected by treatment. The median time to platelet recovery was 11 and 12 days for the placebo and combined PEG-rHuMGDF groups, respectively. No trends in adverse events suggested dose- or treatment-related toxicity. Two patients withdrew from the study because of an adverse event (allergic reaction in the 7.5 microg/kg group) probably related to study drug, and veno-occlusive disease (VOD) (in the 5 microg/kg group) which was felt not to be related to study drug by the investigator. No patients developed neutralizing antibodies to MGDF. Day +21 and day +28 platelet counts were higher in the group receiving PEG-rHuMGDF (246 vs 148 x 109/l and 299 vs 145 x 109/l, respectively; both P < 0. 05). PEG-rHuMGDF up to 10 microg/kg/day was well tolerated. In this study, there was no effect of study drug on initial platelet engraftment at the doses studied. However, the efficacy of other doses is unknown.",Article,0 , Bone Marrow Transplantation,,0,"

Why do early years educators engage with phonics policy directives in their work with under-threes in England?,['Karen Marie Boardman'],"This paper explores how the neoliberal policy directives relating to the teaching of phonics in schools in England, influences the pedagogy of early years educators (EYEs) working with under-threes. The research highlights that these EYEs are confounded by early reading (ER), given that there is no clear definition or provision separating ER from the mandatory teaching of phonics in schools. This paper asserts that it is vital to detach provision for ER for under-threes from the ‘formal’ teaching of phonics recommended for schools. In addition, EYEs require immediate support to become ‘resistant’ to such inappropriate policy directives, persistently driven by the school readiness agenda and the ‘datafication’ and inequality of early years pedagogy, previously highlighted by Roberts-Holmes and Bradbury.",Article,1 , Policy Futures in Education,Apr 22,1,"

Widespread Exposures of Extensive Clean Shallow Ice in the Mid‐Latitudes of Mars,"['Colin M. Dundas', 'Michael T. Mellon', 'Susan J. Conway[...]', 'Asmin V. Pathare']","Although ice in the Martian midlatitudes is typically covered by a layer of dust or regolith, it is exposed in some locations by fresh impact craters or in erosional scarps. In both cases, the exposed ice is massive or excess ice with a low lithic content. We find that erosional scarps occur between 50° and 61° north and south latitude and that they are concentrated in and near Milankovič crater in the northern hemisphere and southeast of the Hellas basin in the southern hemisphere. These may represent locations of particularly thick or clean bodies of ice. Pits created by retreat of the scarps represent sublimation‐thermokarst landforms that evolve in a manner distinct from other ice‐loss landforms on Mars. New impact craters reveal that clean subsurface ice is widespread at middle‐ and high‐latitudes in both hemispheres at depths less than 1 m. Both the depth to ice and the ice content appear to exhibit significant variability over tens to hundreds of meters. The lowest‐latitude exposed ice is near 39°N and is at the edge of a region where impact exposures between 40° and 50°N are common, consistent with other indications of a high ice content. This lowest‐latitude ice may be currently unstable and subliming. Impact craters on lineated valley fill excavate ice blocks that may represent the top of debris‐covered glacial ice. Together, these landforms indicate widespread, clean subsurface ice at middle‐latitudes on Mars. The distribution and properties of this ice could provide information about past climate conditions.",Article,1 , The Journal of Geophysical Research Planets,Jan 29,1,"

Regularity and Continuity of GP Contacts and Use of Statins Amongst People at Risk of Cardiovascular Events,"['David Youens', 'Jenny Doust', 'Suzanne Robinson', 'Rachael E Moorin']","Background: Regularity and continuity of general practitioner (GP) contacts are associated with reduced hospitalisation. Opportunities for improved medication management are cited as a potential cause. Objective: Determine associations between continuity and regularity of primary care and statin use amongst individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. Design: Observational cohort study using self-report and administrative data from 267,153 participants of the Sax Institute's 45 and Up Study conducted in New South Wales, Australia. from 2006 to 2009. Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) data, from Services Australia, were linked to survey, hospital and death data by the NSW Centre for Health Record Linkage. Participants: The 45 and Up Study participants at risk of CVD outcomes based on self-report and administrative data, divided into existing users and potential users based on dispensing records through the exposure period. Main measures: The Continuity of Care index (COC), measuring whether patients see the same GP, and an index assessing whether GP visits are on a regular basis, measured from July 2011 to June 2012. Amongst potential users, statin initiation from July 2012 to June 2013 was assessed using logistic regression; amongst existing users, adherence was assessed from July 2012 to June 2015 using Cox regression (non-adherence being 30 days without statins). Key results: Amongst 29,420 potential users, the most regular quintile had 1.22 times the odds of initiating statin (95%CI 1.11-1.34), while the high continuity group had an odds ratio of 1.12 (95%CI 1.02-1.24).

This paper is a case report of a patient who had undergone cranioplasty on right forehead region following a surgical excision of tumor. The patient reported to the department of prosthodontics after the healing of cranioplasty wound, and hence, was not willing for further surgical intervention to correct the defect. Thus, it was decided to manage the defect through extra-cranial prosthetic rehabilitation. Among the numerous maxillofacial prosthetic materials, room temperature vulcanizing silicone material was selected for fabrication of the final prosthesis. Pigmentation and shade matching were done for improved aesthetics. The prosthesis tremendously improved her quality of life in terms of appearance and confidence.

In analyses that included both restraint and body dissatisfaction as independent predictors, restraint was associated only with more negative attitudes to eating, whereas body dissatisfaction was significantly associated with all the adverse outcomes. These results cast doubt on the proposition that restrained eating is a primary cause of bulimic symptoms, emotional eating, and psychological distress seen in individuals who are trying to control their weight, and rather suggest that body dissatisfaction is the key factor.",Article,5 , Journal of Abnormal Psychology,,1,"

The Adolescent Food Habits Checklist: reliability and validity of a measure of healthy eating behaviour in adolescents,"['Fiona Johnson', 'J Wardle', 'J Griffith']","Amid concerns about the quality of young people's diets, this paper describes the development of a measure of healthy eating behaviour for use with adolescents. Items for the measure were selected from a larger pool on the basis of responses from a pilot study. The 23-item checklist was validated using measures of dietary fat and fibre intake, fruit and vegetable consumption, dietary restraint, nutrition knowledge and a measure of family income. Participants came from seven secondary schools in the north-west of England. A total of 1822 adolescents aged between 13 and 16 y took part in the study, representing 84% of those invited to participate. Correlations between measures indicate a good level of convergent validity, and the checklist is also shown to have high internal and test-retest reliability. The focus on choices available to adolescents means that the checklist will provide a useful addition to food frequency-type approaches to the measurement of adolescent eating behaviour.

Public Preferences for Allocating Ventilators in an Intensive Care Unit: A Discrete Choice Experiment,"['Richard Norman', 'Suzanne Robinson', 'Helen Dickinson[...]', 'Matthew Anstey']","Background and objective: During the COVID-19 pandemic, resources in intensive care units (ICUs) have the potential to be inadequate to treat all those who might benefit. Therefore, it is paramount to identify the views of the community regarding how to allocate such resources. This study aims to quantify Australian community preferences for ventilation allocation. Methods: A discrete choice experiment was designed and administrated to an adult Australian online panel. Each survey respondent answered 12 choice sets from a total design of 120. Each choice set placed the respondent in the role of hypothetical decision maker, prioritising care between two patients. Conditional logit, mixed logit regression and latent class analysis were used to analyse the data. Additionally, we asked a series of attitudinal questions about different methods of making such decisions in practice, focusing on who should be responsible. Results: A total of 1050 community members completed the survey and responded to each choice. Dimensions considered most important were age, likely effectiveness, smoking status, whether the person has dependents, whether they are a healthcare worker, and whether they have a disability or not. Estimating marginal rates of substitution between patient characteristics and chance of survival if ventilated yielded values of up to 30 percentage points if the patient was 70 years old relative to being 30. However, respondents typically said they would prefer such decisions to be made by medical professionals. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the preferences of the community to allocation of ventilators during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of such information should be treated with some caution as the underlying reason for such pr

WHAT CAN BE LEARNT FROM 130 CHILDREN'S DREAM WHEELCHAIR DESIGNS? ELICITING CHILD-CENTRED INSIGHTS USING AN INTERDISCIPLINARY DESIGN ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK,"['Cara Shaw', 'Farnaz Nickpour', 'Francesca Bernardi']","The design of inclusive paediatric mobility (IPM) interventions, such as children's wheelchairs, are entangled with technological, health and social considerations. As narratives around childhood, disability and mobility shift and transform, these entanglements evolve. In order to optimise the experience of childhood mobility, IPM designers must understand and respond to such changes and channel children's own requirements, desires and 'dreams' into the design process; this can be achieved by utilising a child-centred design approach. This paper identifies meaningful child-centred IPM design insights and opportunities through the interdisciplinary analysis of 130 dream wheelchair designs by disabled children, aged 4 to 17 years. A novel interdisciplinary and child-centred design analysis framework is developed to dissect, categorise and code the topics and features expressed through visuals and written descriptions in each of the children's dream wheelchair designs. Children's mobility narratives, desires and requirements are elicited and trending topics are discussed. It is proposed that valuing children's voices in the IPM design process could alter both the process of designing IPM interventions as well as the product outcomes.",Conference Paper,,,Aug 6,1,"

The effects of pegylated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEG-rHuMGDF) on platelet recovery in breast cancer patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation,"['Michael W Schuster', 'Roy Beveridge', 'Debra Frei-Lahr[...]', 'Edmund K Waller']","To assess the safety and efficacy of pegylated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEG-rHuMGDF) administered after autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were done. In the phase 1/2 study, 75 breast cancer patients underwent a bone marrow harvest and myeloablative STAMP V chemotherapy and were randomized to receive placebo or one of three doses of PEG-rHuMGDF. In the phase 3 study, 64 patients were randomized to receive placebo or the minimally effective dose of PEG-rHuMGDF. The study drug was administered daily starting on the day of bone marrow infusion until the platelet count was greater than or equal to 50 x 10(9)/L (without transfusion) or for a maximum of 28 days. All patients received 10 microg/kg/day filgrastim starting on day 2 until neutrophil count recovery. PEG-rHuMGDF appeared to be safe and well tolerated. No significant differences were noted in mortality or disease progression rates. Antibodies to MGDF were not observed. In the phase 1/2 study, the time to platelet recovery to greater than or equal to 20 x 10(9)/L and platelet transfusion requirements were significantly reduced for patients treated with PEG-rHuMGDF compared with placebo (p < 0.05). In the phase 3 study, no significant differences in the kinetics of early thrombopoiesis or platelet transfusions after ABMT were observed. PEG-rHuMGDF was not consistently efficacious in reducing the duration of severe thrombocytopenia. The maximum platelet counts for PEG-rHuMGDF-treated patients occurred a median of 2 weeks after the last dose of drug, suggesting that the biologic effects of this hematopoietic cytokine are de

Visual Cues Given by Humans Are Not Sufficient for Asian Elephants (Elephas maximus) to Find Hidden Food,"['Joshua M Plotnik', 'Jen Pokorny', 'Titiporn Keratimanochaya[...]', 'David Getz']","Recent research suggests that domesticated species - due to artificial selection by humans for specific, preferred behavioral traits - are better than wild animals at responding to visual cues given by humans about the location of hidden food. \Although this seems to be supported by studies on a range of domesticated (including dogs, goats and horses) and wild (including wolves and chimpanzees) animals, there is also evidence that exposure to humans positively influences the ability of both wild and domesticated animals to follow these same cues. Here, we test the performance of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) on an object choice task that provides them with visual-only cues given by humans about the location of hidden food. Captive elephants are interesting candidates for investigating how both domestication and human exposure may impact cue-following as they represent a non-domesticated species with almost constant human interaction. As a group, the elephants (n = 7) in our study were unable to follow pointing, body orientation or a combination of both as honest signals of food location. They were, however, able to follow vocal commands with which they were already familiar in a novel context, suggesting the elephants are able to follow cues if they are sufficiently salient. Although the elephants' inability to follow the visual cues provides partial support for the domestication hypothesis, an alternative explanation is that elephants may rely more heavily on other sensory modalities, specifically olfaction and audition. Further research will be needed to rule out this alternative explanation.",Article,3 , PLoS ONE,,1,"
