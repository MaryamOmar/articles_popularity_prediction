"What Family Circumstances, During COVID-19, Impact on Parental Mental Health in an Inner City Community in London?","['Lydia Whitaker', 'Claire Cameron', 'Hanan Hauari[...]', ""Margaret O'Brien""]","The introduction of lockdown due to a public health emergency in March 2020 marked the beginning of substantial changes to daily life for all families with young children. Here we report the experience of families from London Borough of Tower Hamlets with high rates of poverty and ethnic and linguistic diversity. This inner city community, like communities worldwide, has experienced a reduction or closure in access to education, support services, and in some cases, a change in or loss of income, job, and food security. Using quantitative survey items ( N = 992), we examined what differences in family circumstances, for mothers and fathers of young children aged 0–5 living in Tower Hamlets, during March 2020 to November 2020, were associated with their mental health status. We measure parental mental health using symptoms of depression (self-report: Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale: PHQ-8), symptoms of anxiety levels (self-report: General Anxiety Disorder: GAD-7), and perceptions of direct loneliness. We find parental mental health difficulties are associated with low material assets (financial security, food security, and children having access to outside space), familial assets (parents time for themselves and parent status: lone vs. cohabiting), and community assets (receiving support from friends and family outside the household). South Asian parents and fathers across ethnicities were significantly more likely to experience mental health difficulties, once all other predictors were accounted for. These contributing factors should be considered for future pandemics, where restrictions on people's lives are put in place, and speak to the importance of reducing financial insecurity and food ins

Forecasting the vaccine uptake rate: An infodemiological study in the US,"['Xingzuo Zhou', 'Yiang Li']","A year following the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China, many countries have approved emergency vaccines. Public-health practitioners and policymakers must understand the predicted populational willingness for vaccines and implement relevant stimulation measures. This study developed a framework for predicting vaccination uptake rate based on traditional clinical data-involving an autoregressive model with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)- and innovative web search queries-involving a linear regression with ordinary least squares/least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and machine-learning with boost and random forest. For accuracy, we implemented a stacking regression for the clinical data and web search queries. The stacked regression of ARIMA (1,0,8) for clinical data and boost with support vector machine for web data formed the best model for forecasting vaccination speed in the US. The stacked regression provided a more accurate forecast. These results can help governments and policymakers predict vaccine demand and finance relevant programs.",Preprint,,,5d ago,1,"

Exploring equity in educational policies and interventions in primary and secondary education in the context of public health emergencies: A systematic literature review,"['Yi Shi', 'Kendra Pyne', 'Dhirapat Kulophas', 'Mukdarut Bangpan']","School disruptions during public health emergencies (PHEs) have a detrimental effect on students, families and societies, and exacerbate pre-existing education inequalities. Built on OECD's six education equity policy options and PROGRESS-Plus framework, this systematic review produced a narrative account of consequences of and barriers to access to primary and secondary educational policies and interventions implemented during PHEs through an equity lens. By examining 52 included studies, the review found that disadvantaged learners lacked reliable access to essential learning materials and resources. Families from disadvantaged socio-economic background and those with learning difficulties required extra support services during remote learning. Schools faced unique challenges in delivering inclusive teaching during PHEs. Recommendations were provided for practitioners to uphold education equity during school disruptions.",Article,2 , International Journal of Educational Research,5d ago,0,"

Ethnic Inequalities in Healthcare Use and Care Quality among People with Multiple Long-Term Health Conditions Living in the United Kingdom: A Systematic Review and Narrative Synthesis,"['Brenda Adongo Hayanga', 'Mai Stafford', 'Laia Bécares']","Indicative evidence suggests that the prevalence of multiple long-term conditions (i.e., conditions that cannot be cured but can be managed with medication and other treatments) may be higher in people from minoritised ethnic groups when compared to people from the White majority population. Some studies also suggest that there are ethnic inequalities in healthcare use and care quality among people with multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs). The aims of this review are to (1) identify and describe the literature that reports on ethnicity and healthcare use and care quality among people with MLTCs in the UK and (2) examine how healthcare use and/or care quality for people with MLTCs compares across ethnic groups. We registered the protocol on PROSPERO (CRD42020220702). We searched the following databases up to December 2020: ASSIA, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science core collection. Reference lists of key articles were also hand-searched for relevant studies. The outcomes of interest were patterns of healthcare use and care quality among people with MLTCs for at least one minoritised ethnic group, compared to the White majority population in the UK. Two reviewers, L.B. and B.H., screened and extracted data from a random sample of studies (10%). B.H. independently screened and extracted data from the remaining studies. Of the 718 studies identified, 14 were eligible for inclusion. There was evidence indicating ethnic inequalities in disease management and emergency admissions among people with MLTCs in the five studies that counted more than two long-term conditions. Compared to their White counterparts, Black and Asian children and young people h

The relational navigator: a pedagogical reframing of widening educational participation for care-experienced young people,"['Penny Jane Burke', 'Claire Cameron', 'Emily Fuller', 'Katie Hollingworth']","Young people in state care not only lose support, usually at 18 years of age, but also experience unequal participation in post-secondary education. This has raised concern about the importance of widening participation (WP) for care-experienced young people (CEYP). However, CEYP are often institutionally stigmatised and this could be worsened by WP interventions that are framed by deficit discourses. Weaving together social pedagogies and social justice theories, the article aims to reframe WP away from deficit discourses through recognition of the systemic, structural and cultural inequalities that most CEYP must navigate to access formal education. We introduce the concept of the relational navigator , in which a pedagogical relationship enables the navigator to ‘pilot’ through complex systems and transitional processes in collaboration with, and through ‘walking alongside’, the CEYP with respect to their lived contexts and experiences. This article draws from the reflections of WP navigators situated in two small-scale WP projects, one in an English museum and the other in an Australian university. Our analysis of the reflections of the WP project navigators is offered as a preliminary exploration of the potential the relational navigator as a way to shift deficit discourses and work towards a reframing of WP through a social pedagogical perspective.",Article,1 , International Journal of Social Pedagogy,Nov 27,0,"

Bone disease in CKD 5D,"['L. Patrier', 'A.-M. Dupuis', 'A. Granger Vallee[...]', 'R. Wilson']","INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Declining renal function is associated with a progressive increase in serum fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) levels. In patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT), high FGF-23 circulating levels have been associated with vascular calcifications and mortality, suggesting that FGF-23 could be a uremic toxin. In this perspective, reducing FGF-23 concentrations in this patient population appears an appealing approach. The purpose of our study was therefore to compare the clearance of FGF-23 between high flux haemodialysis (HD) and on-line haemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) procedures. METHODS: Two groups were defined according to their prevalent RRT modality. 53 patients (29 men, 24 women; median age 73 [range 41-91] years; mean dialysis vintage 4.4 [range 0.5-22.0] years) were included in the HD group while 32 patients (19 men, 13 women; median age 73 [range 40-89] years; mean dialysis vintage 3.5 [range 0.5-36.0] years) were included in the OL-HDF group. Serum pre- and post-dialysis FGF-23 levels were measured using a 2nd generation Human FGF-23 (C-Term) ELISA kit. Dialysis adequacy was assessed by serum urea and creatinine levels, urea single-pool Kt/V, and urea reduction rate. Bone and mineral disorders were evaluated by pre- and post-dialysis calcium and phosphate concentrations, calcium-phosphate product, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels. RESULTS: Median FGF-23 reduction rates were significantly higher with OL-HDF (55.7±25.2 %) versus HD (36.2±28.6 %) procedures (p=0.0331). Similarly, median calculated FGF-23 clearances (OL-HDF 55.0 vs. HD 41.8 ml/min, p = 0.015) and Kt/V (OL-HDF 1.00 vs. HD 0.72, p=0.0001) were significantly s

A New Perspective from Time Use Research on the Effects of Lockdown on COVID-19 Behavioral Infection Risk,"['Jonathan Gershuny', 'Oriel Sullivan', 'Almudena Sevilla[...]', 'Pierre Walthery']","We present findings from the first two waves of an innovative, population-representative, UK time-use diary survey conducted both pre- and mid-lockdown, using an online diary instrument that proved both reliable and quick-to-field. Combining diary information on activity, location, and co-presence to estimate infection risks associated with daily behavior, we show clear changes in such behavior related to infection risk between the pre- and mid-lockdown periods: a substantial reduction of time spent in those behaviors with the highest levels of risk, accompanied by an equivalent increase in low-risk behavior. Because, in general, a populations' time use changes relatively slowly, the behavioral changes revealed may be interpreted directly as a consequence of the UK COVID-19 'lockdown' regulations. Subsequent waves will reveal the behavioral consequences of future changes in regulation.",Article,0 , SSRN Electronic Journal,Nov 20,0,"

Comparisons were made between the processes of spark ignition and transient plasma ignition. Compared with the spark ignition, the transient plasma ignition has larger ignition area. Based on those, the initiation detonation by spark ignition and transient plasma ignition were simulated. The fuel is CH4.

"Income, ethnic diversity and family life in East London during the first wave of the pandemic: An assets approach","['Claire Cameron', ""Margaret O'Brien"", 'Lydia Whitaker[...]', 'Hanan Hauari']","Objective: This paper reports first results from a survey of 992 parents and parents to be living in an ethnically diverse and socio-economically unequal borough of East London during the coronavirus pandemic that reduced mobility, closed services and threatened public health. Background: Little is known about the place based impacts of the pandemic on families with young children. We describe the living circumstances of families with children under five or expecting a baby living in Tower Hamlets during the Coronavirus pandemic in 2020, and then examine the relative importance of household characteristics such as ethnicity and household income for adverse impacts on survey respondents, as seen in mental health outcomes. Method: a community survey sample recruited with support from the local council comprised 75% mothers/pregnant women, 25% fathers/partners of pregnant women. Reflecting the borough population, 35 percent were White British or Irish and 36 percent were Bangladeshi, and the remainder were from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. Adopting an assets based approach, we describe material, familial and community assets using three household income bands and seven ethnic groups. We then use regressions to identify which assets were most important in mitigating adversity. Results: We find that material assets (income, employment, food insecurity, housing quality) were often insecure and in decline but familial assets (home caring practices, couple relationships) were largely sustained. Community assets (informal support, service provision) were less available or means of access had changed.

Global stakeholder perspectives of home birth: a systematic scoping review,"['Ginny Brunton', 'Samira Wahab', 'Hassan Sheikh', 'Beth Murray-Davis']","Home birth is experienced by people very differently worldwide. These experiences likely differ by the type of stakeholder involved (women, their support persons, birth attendants, policy-makers), the experience itself (low-risk birth, transfer to hospital, previous deliveries), and by the health system within which home birth occurs (e.g., high-resource versus low- and middle-resource countries). Research evidence of stakeholders’ perspectives of home birth could usefully inform personal and policy decisions about choosing and providing home birth, but the current literature is fragmented and its breadth is not fully understood. We conducted a systematic scoping review to understand how the research literature on stakeholders’ perspectives of home birth is characterized in terms of populations, settings and identified issues, and what potential gaps exist in the research evidence. A range of electronic, web-based and key informant sources of evidence were searched. Located references were assessed, data extracted, and descriptively analyzed using robust methods. Our analysis included 460 full reports. Findings from 210 reports of studies in high-resource countries suggested that research with fathers and same-sex partners, midwives, and vulnerable populations and perspectives of freebirth and transfer to hospital could be synthesized. Gaps in primary research exist with respect to family members, policy makers, and those living in rural and remote locations. A further 250 reports of studies in low- and middle-resource countries suggested evidence for syntheses related to fathers and other family members, policy makers, and other health care providers and examination of issues related to emergency transfer t

Sexual Orientations and Identities Among Sexual Minority Emerging Adults: Marc E. D. Svensson and David M. FrostMarc E. D. Svensson and David M. Frost,"['Marc E. D. Svensson', 'David M Frost']","This chapter focuses on the development of sexual orientations and identities among sexual minority emerging adults, such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, pansexual, and other non-heterosexual sexual identities. The importance of sociohistorical context when examining sexual orientations and identity development is considered in explaining why emerging adults increasingly question binary constructs of both sexuality and gender, and more often adopt fluid and shifting identities, compared to older generations. New psychological frameworks accounting for these more diverse ways of approaching sexual identity and gender identity are reviewed. Nevertheless, health disparities among sexual minority emerging adults still prevail, and the minority stress framework is utilized to explain and understand the underlying reasons. The chapter concludes with suggestions on directions for future research on sexual orientations and identities in emerging adulthood.",Chapter,,,Nov 4,0,"

Ethnic and sexual identities: inequalities in adolescent health and wellbeing in a national population-based study,"['Amal Khanolkar', 'David M Frost', 'Victoria Redclift[...]', 'Evangeline Tabor']","Aims To examine inequalities related to dual sexual- and ethnic-identities in risk for health, wellbeing, and health-related behaviours in a nationally representative sample of adolescents. Methods 9,789 adolescents (51% female) aged 17 years from the UK-wide Millennium Cohort Study, with data on self-identified sexual- and ethnic-identities. Adolescents were grouped into White-Heterosexual, White sexual minority (White-SM), ethnic minority (EM)-heterosexual, and ethnic- and sexual minority (EM-SM). Mental health (e.g., self-reported psychological distress, doctor-diagnosed depression, attempted suicide, victimisation), general health (self-rated health, chronic illness, BMI) and a range of health-related behaviours (e.g., smoking, substance use) were assessed by questionnaires. Associations between dual identities and outcomes were analysed using logistic and linear regression (adjusted for sex and parental income). Results Sexual minorities (White:18% and ethnic minority:3%) had increased odds for mental ill-health and attempted suicide, with higher odds in White-SM than EM-SM. Compared to White-heterosexuals, White-SM and EM-SM had higher odds for psychological distress (OR 3.47/2.24 for White-SM/EM-SM respectively), and emotional problems (OR 3.17/1.65). White-SM and EM-SM had higher odds for attempted suicide (OR 2.78/2.02), self-harm (OR 3.06/1.52), and poor sleep quality (OR 1.88/1.67). In contrast, White-Heterosexual and White-SM groups had similarly high proportions reporting risky behaviours except for drug use (OR 1.34) and risky sex (OR 1.40) more common in White-SM individuals.

The complicated connection between closeness and the quality of romantic relationships,"['David M Frost', 'Allen J.

This study examined the implications that discrepancies between actual and ideal closeness have for relationship quality in romantic couples. A questionnaire was administered to a sample of 103 cohabiting couples ( N = 206) in the United States, who were randomly selected from a nationally representative survey panel. Dyadic analysis using actor–partner interdependence models with latent outcomes revealed that internal discrepancies between actual and idealized closeness were associated with poorer relationship quality for both individuals and their partners. These associations persisted above and beyond the effects of actual closeness and dyad-level differences in actual and ideal closeness. The association between closeness and relationship quality may be more individual than dyadic in nature, warranting renewed attention to the idiographic experience of closeness and its association with relational well-being.",Article,1 , Journal of Social and Personal Relationships,Nov 4,0,"

Well-being of children born after medically assisted reproductionKindeswohl nach medizinisch assistierter Reproduktion,"['Alice Goisis', 'Mikko Myrskylä']","Background The increasing number and proportion of children born after medically assisted reproduction (MAR) has raised concerns and motivated research about the impact of MAR on the well-being and development of children. Objective We summarize existing studies on the well-being and development of children conceived through MAR. Materials and methods Review of existing studies. Results Children conceived through MAR are at increased risk of adverse birth outcomes such as low birthweight and preterm delivery compared to naturally conceived children. The higher rates of multiple births amongst MAR-conceived children continue to represent an important driving factor behind these disparities. Reassuringly, elective single embryo transfer (eSET)—which is associated with more favourable pregnancy outcomes among MAR-conceived children—is becoming more common. Despite the early life health disadvantages, the evidence on later life outcomes such as physical, cognitive and psychosocial development is generally reassuring. On average, MAR-conceived children show similar or better outcomes than naturally conceived children. The selected and advantaged socioeconomic characteristics of parents who conceive through MAR are likely to play an important role in explaining why, on average, MAR-conceived children perform better than naturally conceived children—particularly in terms of cognitive outcomes. In contrast, there is some evidence pointing to potentially increased risks of mental health problems among MAR-conceived children.

Sexual orientation and health behaviors among college students in Italy,"['Maria Sironi', 'Julie Fricke']","Studies regarding sexual orientation and health behaviors have largely neglected the Italian context. This research utilizes the second wave of the ‘Sexual and Emotional Life of Youths’ (SELFY) data set to compare the health behaviors of sexual minority (SM) and heterosexual college students in Italy. Results showed that bisexual women were more likely than heterosexual women to smoke both 1–7 and 8+ cigarettes per day, get drunk sometimes and often/very often, and use marijuana and/or ecstasy sometimes and often/very often. Homosexual women were more likely than heterosexual women to smoke 1–7 cigarettes per day, get drunk often/very often, and use marijuana and/or ecstasy often/very often. Homosexual men were more likely than heterosexual men to smoke 8+ cigarettes per day, but less likely to get drunk often/very often. Bisexual men were less likely than heterosexual men to participate in physical activity sometimes, often, and very often. Finally, bisexual men were less likely to exercise often than homosexual men. This work highlights that SM college students in Italy, particularly women, are more likely to engage in specific risky health behaviors compared to their heterosexual counterparts. More attention needs to be given to SMs in Italy to inform the Italian national health care system and to ensure that the appropriate care can be provided when required.",Article,1 , Genus,Oct 21,1,"

Participatory research in and against time,['Rachel Rosen'],"The staccato rhythms of experiential time remain obscured in much of the literature on participatory research, where time is treated as a reassuring constant – a backdrop for human activity. This article addresses the discordances between lived temporalities and existing theorisations of participatory methodologies. It takes participatory research with lone child migrants as a particularly rich case to think with, given the proliferation of contradictory and often punitive applications of time these young people encounter in their interactions with migration and welfare regimes. The core argument developed is that unless temporality is given due theoretical and methodological attention, aims of contesting and unsettling inequities through participatory research will have limited success and can wind up reproducing exclusions and oppressions. In response to these critiques, the paper temporalizes participatory research through three reconstructions: working with and against time, de-centring shared time and collectivising the time of participatory research.",Article,1 , Qualitative Research,Oct 18,0,"

Concerted measures at both the policy and ideological level are required to redress this problem. // Recent statistics show a gender pay gap of 16% in Europe1, and 18% in the USA2, despite half a century of women moving into paid employment. Gender inequality in pay is intricately linked to gender inequality in work–family balance, especially in the division of paid and unpaid work. Women shoulder the greatest burden of unpaid work and care, decreasing their opportunities for employment and career progression.

Background: Few studies have investigated families headed by transgender individuals. Even less in contexts where there are no specific policies for family planning in this group, as is the case in Brazil. Methods: A hospital and web-based cross-sectional survey recruited transgender individuals from two Brazilian states, during July–October 2014 and January–March 2015. The survey was designed based on a cross-cultural adaptation of the TransPULSE project. Results: From 670 participants, 44 reported being parents, were older, stated more years of education and were more likely to be in a relationship, than the transgender adults who were not parents. Controlling for age, transgender parents reported suffering more discrimination than those who have no children. Among them, most became parents through biological means, 17.06% reported having lost or having the custody reduced for being transgender and 48.07% suspected or were told that their ability to see their children less was due to their gender identity. Implications: The findings of this study are relevant to guide the practice of individual, couple, and family therapists working with transgender clients.",Article,1 , Family Relations,Sep 19,0,"

Using time-use diaries to track changing behavior across successive stages of COVID-19 social restrictions,"['Oriel Sullivan', 'Jonathan Gershuny', 'Almudena Sevilla[...]', 'Pierre Walthery']","How did people change their behavior over the different phases of the UK COVID-19 restrictions, and how did these changes affect their risk of being exposed to infection? Time-use diary surveys are unique in providing a complete chronicle of daily behavior: 24-h continuous records of the populations’ activities, their social context, and their location. We present results from four such surveys, collected in real time from representative UK samples, both before and at three points over the course of the current pandemic. Comparing across the four waves, we find evidence of substantial changes in the UK population’s behavior relating to activities, locations, and social context. We assign different levels of risk to combinations of activities, locations, and copresence to compare risk-related behavior across successive “lockdowns.” We find evidence that during the second lockdown (November 2020), there was an increase in high-risk behaviors relative to the first (starting March 2020). This increase is shown to be associated with more paid work time in the workplace. At a time when capacity is still limited both in respect of immunization and track–trace technology, governments must continue to rely on changes in people’s daily behaviors to contain the spread of COVID-19 and similar viruses. Time-use diary information of this type, collected in real time across the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, can provide policy makers with information to assess and quantify changes in daily behaviors and the impact they are likely to have on overall behavioral-associated risks.",Article,1 , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,Aug 31,1,"

The effectiveness and suitability of interventions for social isolation and loneliness for older people from minoritised ethnic groups living in the UK,['Brenda Adongo Hayanga'],"This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and suitability of social isolation and loneliness interventions for older people from minoritised ethnic groups living in the UK. It employed an iterative mixed-methods approach, conducted in four phases. Using data from Understanding Society: the UK Household Longitudinal Study, Phase 1 explored ethnic variations in the friendship networks of older people using logistic regression analyses. Compared to older white people, older minoritised people’s friendship networks were found to be restricted in size and accessibility. These findings were explored further in Phase 2 using in-depth interviews with older people from minoritised ethnic groups. Community groups were identified as important for protecting against social isolation and loneliness. A mixed-methods systematic review was subsequently conducted to assess whether community-based group interventions reduced social isolation and loneliness in older people, and to uncover their underlying mechanisms. The evidence of effectiveness based on the meta-analyses was unclear, and qualitative comparative analysis was used to understand (non)effective interventions. The most effective interventions were found to adopt cognitive approaches to reducing loneliness, recruit participants with shared characteristics and provide participants with opportunities to connect.

Area-level and family-level socioeconomic position and body composition trajectories: longitudinal analysis of the UK Millennium Cohort Study,"['Charis Bridger Staatz', 'Yvonne Kelly', 'Rebecca E Lacey', 'Rebecca Hardy']","Background Inequalities in the trajectories of body composition in childhood and adolescence have been infrequently studied. Despite the importance of environmental factors in obesity development, little research has looked at area-level socioeconomic position, independent of family socioeconomic position. We aimed to assess how inequalities in body composition develop with age. Methods The Millennium Cohort Study is a longitudinal study of 19 243 families who had a child born between 2000 and 2002 in the UK. Multilevel growth curve models were applied to examine change in fat mass index (FMI), fat free mass index (FFMI; using the Benn index), and fat mass to fat free mass ratio (FM:FFM), measured using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis, from ages 7 years to 17 years by the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) and household income at baseline. Findings Inequalities in FMI and FM:FFM ratio are evident at age 7 years and widen with age. At age 17 years, adolescents in the most disadvantaged IMD group had FMI 0·57 kg/mB (B=Benn parameter; 95% CI 0·43 to 0·70) higher and FM:FFM ratio 0·037 (95% CI 0·026 to 0·047) higher compared with the most advantaged group. Disadvantaged socioeconomic position is associated with higher FFMI but is reversed in adolescence after adjustment for FMI. Inequalities were greater in girls at age 7 years (mean FMI 0·22 kg/mB; 95% CI 0·13 to 0·32) compared with boys of the same age (0·05 kg/mB; –0·04 to 0·15, p=0·3), but widen fastest in boys, especially for FMI, in which there was over an 11 times increase in the inequality from age 7 years of 0·05kg/mB (95% CI –0·04 to 0·15) to 0·62 kg/mB at 17 years (0·42 to 0·82). Inequalities for the IMD were similar to income, and persisted at ag

Socioeconomic position and body composition in childhood in high- and middle-income countries: a systematic review and narrative synthesis,"['Charis Bridger Staatz', 'Yvonne Kelly', 'Rebecca E Lacey[...]', 'Rebecca Hardy']","Background The relation between socioeconomic position (SEP) and obesity measured by body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight for height, has been extensively reviewed in children, showing consistent associations between disadvantaged SEP and higher BMI in high-income countries (HICs) and lower BMI in middle-income countries (MICs). Fat mass (FM), a more accurate measure of adiposity, and fat-free mass (FFM) are not captured by BMI, but have been shown to track from childhood to adulthood, and be important for cardiovascular health and functional outcomes in later life. It is not clear whether body composition is associated with SEP. We systematically reviewed the association between SEP and body composition in childhood. Methods A systematic review was carried out following PRISMA guidelines. The protocol was pre-registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019119937). Original studies in the English language, which examined the association between SEP and body composition in childhood, were included. An electronic search of three databases was conducted. Two independent reviewers carried out screening, data extraction and quality assessment. Due to heterogeneity in results, a narrative synthesis was conducted. Heterogeneity in findings according to SEP, sex, body composition measure and country income level was investigated. Results 50 papers were included, the majority from HICs. No papers were from low-income countries. Disadvantage in childhood was associated with greater FM and lower FFM in HICs, but with lower FM and lower FFM in MICs. When measures of FFM indexed to height were used there was no evidence of associations with SEP. In HICs, more studies reported associations between disadvant

Life course socioeconomic position and body composition in adulthood: a systematic review and narrative synthesis,"['Charis Bridger Staatz', 'Yvonne Kelly', 'Rebecca E Lacey[...]', 'Rebecca Hardy']","Multiple systematic reviews have investigated the relation between socioeconomic position (SEP) and body mass index (BMI) throughout the life course. However, BMI does not capture quantity and distribution of fat and muscle, which are better indicators of obesity than BMI, and have been independently linked to adverse health outcomes. Less is known about the relation between SEP and body composition, and the literature has not been reviewed. We therefore systematically reviewed the literature on the association between life course SEP and body composition in adulthood. A protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42019119937), and the review followed PRISMA guidelines. An electronic search of three databases (MEDLINE, Embase Classic + Embase and SPORTDiscus) was conducted. Original studies in the English language were included that examine the association between any recognised measure of SEP at any age and body composition (fat mass, fat-free mass, ratio and distribution) in adulthood, measured using a direct technique, i.e., not an anthropometric measure. A narrative synthesis was conducted. A total of 47 papers were included in the final review, none were from low-income countries (LICs). Greater advantage in childhood and adulthood was associated with lower fat levels in high-income countries (HICs). Associations in the opposite direction were found exclusively in middle-income countries (MICs). No studies in MICs reported associations for childhood SEP. For measures of lean mass, the majority of papers reported no association, or greater advantage in adulthood associated with higher lean mass, with little variation between HICs and MICs.

Risk factors for long COVID: analyses of 10 longitudinal studies and electronic health records in the UK,"['Ellen Jo Thompson', 'Dylan M. Williams', 'Alex J Walker[...]', 'Claire Steves']","Background The impact of long COVID is considerable, but risk factors are poorly characterised. We analysed symptom duration and risk factor from 10 longitudinal study (LS) samples and electronic healthcare records (EHR). Methods Samples: 6907 adults self-reporting COVID-19 infection from 48,901 participants in the UK LS, and 3,327 adults with COVID-19, were assigned a long COVID code from 1,199,812 individuals in primary care EHR. Outcomes for LS included symptom duration lasting 4+ weeks (long COVID) and 12+ weeks. Association with of age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, smoking, general and mental health, overweight/obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and asthma was assessed. Results In LS, symptoms impacted normal functioning for 12+ weeks in 1.2% (mean age 20 years) to 4.8% (mean age 63 y) of COVID-19 cases. Between 7.8% (mean age 28 y) and 17% (mean age 58 y) reported any symptoms for 12+ weeks, and greater proportions for 4+ weeks. Age was associated with a linear increased risk in long COVID between 20 and 70 years. Being female (LS: OR=1.49; 95%CI:1.24-1.79; EHR: OR=1.51 [1.41-1.61]), having poor pre-pandemic mental health (LS: OR=1.46 [1.17-1.83]; EHR: OR=1.57 [1.47-1.68]) and poor general health (LS: OR=1.62 [1.25-2.09]; EHR: OR=1.26; [1.18-1.35]) were associated with higher risk of long COVID. Individuals with asthma (LS: OR=1.32 [1.07-1.62]; EHR: OR=1.56 [1.46-1.67]), and overweight or obesity (LS: OR=1.25 [1.01-1.55]; EHR: OR=1.31 [1.21-1.42]) also had higher risk.

Mental Health Around the Transition to First Birth: Does Medically Assisted Reproduction Matter?,"['Marco Tosi', 'Alice Goisis']","Previous research has shown that childbearing is associated with short-term improvements in women's subjective well-being but that these effects depend on the timing and quantum of the birth as well as on the parents' education and socioeconomic status. These studies did not address whether and, if so, how this effect varies according to the mode of conception. This represents an important knowledge gap, given that conceptions through medically assisted reproduction (MAR) have been increasing rapidly in recent decades, exceeding 5% of live births in some European countries. Drawing on nine waves (2009/2010–2017/2018) of the UK Household Longitudinal Study, we use distributed fixed-effects linear regression models to examine changes in women's mental health before, during, and after natural and MAR conceptions. The results show that the mental health of women who conceived naturally improved around the time of conception and then gradually returned to baseline levels; comparatively, the mental health of women who conceived through MAR declined in the year before pregnancy and then gradually recovered. The findings also indicate that women's happiness decreased both two years and one year before an MAR conception and then increased above the baseline in the year of pregnancy. We further show that the deterioration in mental health and subjective well-being before an MAR conception affects both partners, which could be part of a longer process in which the partners potentially suffer from stress related not solely to the MAR treatments themselves but also to the experience of subfertility.",Article,1 , Demography,May 31,0,"

Call for papers: LGBTI+ population and healthcare context,"['Paolo Valerio', 'Cristiano Scandurra', 'David M. Frost']","Although research on the health of LGBTI+ populations is expanding rapidly, including a focus on social and health policies, the experiences of LGBTI+ people within healthcare contexts needs to be explored in even more in detail. An increasing body of research has demonstrated that LGBTI+ people face health inequalities, which are due to the pernicious effects of social stigma. A more accurate understanding of the quality of care received and perceived by this population represents a fundamental social issue and a central focus for reducing health inequalities. Indeed, many LGBTI+ people still avoid healthcare contexts for fear of discrimination from healthcare providers. On the other hand, many healthcare providers still have little knowledge about the specific health needs of this population. A further issue concerns the structural/institutional stigma embedded within some health organizations due to the existence of laws and regulations that not guarantee full equality for LGBTI+ populations. The focus of this thematic issue is the experience of LGBTI+ people within healthcare contexts. We invite contributions from a plurality of theoretical and methodological perspectives, including but not limited to: clinical and social psychology, sociology, philosophy, jurisprudence, diversity management, organization and HR management. Qualitative, quantitative and/or mixed-method design are welcome, as well as reviews and critical reflections. Manuscripts focused on the experiences of intersectionality (e.g., intersections of race, ethnicity, ability, class, migration status, etc. within LGBTI+ populations) and from diverse geographic regions are particularly welcome.",Article,8 , puntOorg International Journal,May 16,0,"

Precarious Care and (Dis)Connections: Adults Working With Separated Child Migrants in England and Their Understandings of Care,"['Sarah Crafter', 'Rachel Rosen', 'Veena Meetoo']","Adult stakeholders who work with separated child migrants (SCMs) face a substantial challenge to their capacity or remit to care amid increasingly hostile immigration environments. This paper explores a diverse range of adult stakeholders' understandings of the care of SCMs, filling an important gap in understanding how care is conceptualized by those working in often complex and contradictory positions. Drawing on the care literature, this study focuses on 15 qualitative semistructured interviews with state and nonstate adult stakeholders in England (e.g., social work, law, police, and NGO workers). We argue that stringent immigration practices, policies, and bureaucratic and structural challenges undoubtedly present personal tensions and professional constraints for those whose role is meant to foreground “care.” Importantly, when taking into account a range of different perspectives, roles, and responsibilities across professions and sectors, our respondents were constrained in varying ways or had varying room to maneuver within their institutional contexts. Our analysis suggests that amid a hostile immigration environment, care connections with and between SCMs are treated with mistrust and are unstable over space and time. We argue that how care is conceptualized and experienced is mutually constituted by hostile policies and procedures, adult stakeholders' roles within or out-with those systems, and their personal values and perspectives. It is within this space where constraints, enablers, and resistances play out. Care is subjectively experienced, and care relationships are open to potential (dis)connection across space and time.",Article,1 , International Perspectives in Psychology Research Practice Consultation,May 2,0,"

"Rapid systematic review of systematic reviews: what befriending, social support and low intensity psychosocial interventions, delivered remotely, may reduce social isolation and loneliness among older adults and how?","['Elisabeth Boulton', 'Dylan Kneale', 'Claire Stansfield[...]', 'Chris James Todd']","Background : During the COVID-19 pandemic ‘social distancing’ has highlighted the need to minimise loneliness and isolation among older adults (aged 50+). We wanted to know what remotely delivered befriending, social support and low intensity psychosocial interventions may help to alleviate social isolation and loneliness and how they work. Methods : We followed a systematic ‘review of reviews’ approach. Searches of 11 databases from the fields of health, social care, psychology and social science were undertaken during April 2020. Reviews meeting our PICOS criteria were included if they focussed on the evaluation of remote interventions to reduce levels of social isolation or loneliness in adults aged 50+ and were critically appraised using AMSTAR2. Narrative synthesis was used at a review and study level to develop a typology of intervention types and their effectiveness. Intervention Component Analysis (ICA) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) were used at a study level to explore the characteristics of successful interventions. Results : We synthesised evidence from five systematic reviews and 18 primary studies. Remote befriending, social support and low intensity psychosocial interventions took the form of: (i) supported video-communication; (ii) online discussion groups and forums; (iii) telephone befriending; (iv) social networking sites; and (v) multi-tool interventions. The majority of studies utilised the first two approaches, and were generally regarded positively by older adults, although with mixed evidence around effectiveness. Focussing on processes and mechanisms, using ICA and QCA, we found that the interventions that were most successful in improving social support: (i) e

We draw on an in-depth interview study with 20 professional researchers, and we analyse their experiences of competing for research funding, focusing on PPI as a process of professional research governance. We unearth dominant professional narratives of scepticism and alternative identifications in their enactment of PPI policy. We argue that such narratives and identifications evidence a resistance to ways in which patient involvement has been institutionalised and to the resulting subject-positions researchers are summoned to take up. We show that the new subjectivities emerging in this landscape of research governance as increasingly disempowered, contradictory and fraught with unresolved tensions over the ethical dimensions of the researchers’ own professional identities.",Article,1 , Journal of Social Policy,Apr 28,0,"

"“It’s being a part of a grand tradition, a grand counter-culture which involves communities”: A qualitative investigation of autistic community connectedness.","['Monique Botha', 'Bridget Dibb', 'David M Frost']","Autistic people report greater comfort socialising and easier communication with each other. Despite autism being stereotypically associated with lack of social motivation, an autistic community has been described briefly in the literature but is not well understood. Autistic community connectedness (ACC) may play a role in promoting wellbeing for autistic people. This qualitative study involved interviewing autistic individuals (N = 20) in-person, via a video-based platform, a text-based platform, or over email to investigate ACC. Critical grounded theory tools were used to collect and analyse the data. There were three elements of ACC: belongingness, social connectedness, and political connectedness. Belongingness referred to the sense of similarity that autistic people experienced with each other. Social connectedness referred to specific friendship participants formed with other autistic people. Political connectedness referred to a connectedness to the political or social equality goals of the autistic community. Participants described the benefits of ACC as being increased self-esteem, a sense of direction, and a sense of community not experienced elsewhere. Lack of connectedness involved ambivalence with an autism identity and/or feelings of internalised stigma. Experiences of ACC may have implications for autistic people’s wellbeing, as well as how they cope with minority stress.",Preprint,,,Apr 26,0,"

Previous studies report health care professionals’ (HCPs) assessment of various parent-related factors as barriers to referral. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of HCPs working in a paediatric tertiary care hospital in the United Kingdom, with an established paediatric palliative care team, to explore staff perceptions of barriers, knowledge and attitudes, with the aim of developing interventions to increase patient access to palliative care services. Survey respondents evidenced good knowledge of the principles of palliative care in closed questions, but their attitudes expressed in open-text questions and reported reasons to refer to a palliative care service demonstrated an association of palliative care with death and dying. We suggest that the association of palliative care with end of life may be a modifiable factor relevant to late and non-referral and deserving of further investigation and attention in education and training.",Article,,,,1,"

‘She has mellowed me into the idea of SPL’: unpacking relational resources in UK couples’ discussions of Shared Parental Leave take-up,['Katherine Twamley'],"This article undertakes an in-depth examination into how two couples negotiate the sharing of parental leave, to understand how ‘relational resources’ may be drawn on in transforming gendered practices. The couples are selected from a longitudinal study of 42 first-time parents taking various combinations of leave. Drawing on a ‘listening guide’ approach, I analyse the interactions observed in couple interviews with a couple that shares, and another couple that does not share leave. I show that in trying to convince their partners to take leave, both women draw on gendered scripts, either in how the interaction is managed, or by the discourses that are drawn on. Moreover, fathers’ work context strongly mediates negotiations, as all participants judge this to trump other considerations regarding leave, reinforcing men’s attachment to the workplace.

Wildman[...]', 'David Voas']","Introduction: COVID-19 has prompted the extensive use of computational models to understand the trajectory of the pandemic. This article surveys the kinds of dynamic simulation models that have been used as decision support tools and to forecast the potential impacts of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). We developed the Values in Viral Dispersion model, which emphasizes the role of human factors and social networks in viral spread and presents scenarios to guide policy responses. Methods: An agent-based model of COVID-19 was developed with individual agents able to move between 3 states (susceptible, infectious, or recovered), with each agent placed in 1 of 7 social network types and assigned a propensity to comply with NPIs (quarantine, contact tracing, and physical distancing). A series of policy questions were tested to illustrate the impact of social networks and NPI compliance on viral spread among (1) populations, (2) specific at-risk subgroups, and (3) individual trajectories. Results: Simulation outcomes showed large impacts of physical distancing policies on number of infections, with substantial modification by type of social network and level of compliance. In addition, outcomes on metrics that sought to maximize those never infected (or recovered) and minimize infections and deaths showed significantly different epidemic trajectories by social network type and among higher or lower at-risk age cohorts. Conclusions: Although dynamic simulation models have important limitations, which are discussed, these decision support tools should be a key resource for navigating the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and can help local and national decision makers determine where, when, and how to invest resources.",Article,1 , Simulation in healthcare: journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare,Apr 7,0,"

Introduction: Reimagining Migrant Generations,"['Mette Berg', 'Susan Eckstein']","We live in an era of globalization involving large-scale international migration and increasing transnational connectedness that have contributed to the emergence and growth of diaspora communities. In this context, questions of how diaspora migrants adapt to host societies and engage with their homelands are becoming increasingly important economically, politically, socially, and culturally—to diasporic groups themselves, to their homelands, and to the countries where they settle. Yet little is known about internal diversity and stratification within individual diasporas. Our understanding of how pre-migration experiences shape migrants’ adaptation where they resettle and their homeland involvements, as well as their relations to other diaspora members settled elsewhere, remains especially inadequate. This Introduction and the special issue more generally advance the understanding of diasporas and their internal diversity, analytically and descriptively, through a historically grounded conceptual generational frame.",Article,5 , Diaspora A Journal of Transnational Studies,Apr 2,0,"

Cubans in the United States and Spain: The Diaspora Generational Divide,"['Susan Eckstein', 'Mette Berg']","For decades the Miami-based Cuban diaspora successfully represented itself globally as a monolithic bloc and influenced US policy vis-a-vis Cuba. Yet the success glosses over the diversity of the Cuban diaspora, not only in Miami, but in the United States more widely, as well as internationally. The first wave of emigres, who are known as “exiles, “ have for decades campaigned for a watertight embargo against Cuba and have on principle refused to visit their homeland. By contrast, more recent Cuban emigres, who have left the island since the economic crisis of the 1990s and who are less affluent and have less political clout, have forged cross-border transnational links with kin and friends on the island. In this article, building on Mannheim’s thesis about the long-lasting impact that early-life experiences may have, we show that diasporic Cubans who left Cuba with shared experiences and then settled in the United States or Spain adapted similarly, and relate to Cuba in similar ways, and differently from Cubans who emigrated at other points in time with different pre-migration lived experiences. Specifically, we compare and contrast two historically grounded generations in the United States and in Spain in terms of labor market insertion, political incorporation, and linguistic and cultural acculturation in the two host countries. We thereby illustrate the explanatory power of our historically grounded thesis of diasporic generation formations that we elucidated in the Introduction. The article shows how historically grounded pre-migration experiences continue to shape and mold the ways in which immigrants relate to their homeland from abroad, in ways that neither the assimilationist nor the transnational framework can account for.

Early life mental health and problematic drinking in mid-adulthood: evidence from two British birth cohorts,"['Ke Ning', 'Praveetha Patalay', 'Jennifer L Maggs', 'George B. Ploubidis']","Purpose Accumulating evidence suggests that externalising problems are consistently associated with alcohol use behaviours, but findings are inconsistent regarding the role of internalising problems. We investigate whether externalising and internalising problems are associated with problematic drinking in mid-adulthood, and whether potential associations are modified by age, sex and cohort. Methods The National Child Development Study (NCDS58, n = 17,633) and 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70, n = 17,568) recruited new-borns in Great Britain in a single week in 1958 and 1970. Mental health was assessed with the Rutter Behaviour Questionnaire at ages 7, 11, and 16 in NCDS58 and ages 5, 10 and 16 in BCS70. Problematic drinking was measured with the CAGE questionnaire at age 33 in NCDS58 and age 34 in BCS70, and the AUDIT scale at age 44/45 in NCDS58 and age 46 in BCS70. Latent scores of externalising and internalising problems were added chronologically into lagged logistic regression models. Results Externalising and internalising problems were associated in opposite directions with problematic drinking in mid-adulthood. Externalising was a risk factor (OR [95% CI] ranging from 1.06 [1.03, 1.10] to 1.11 [1.07, 1.15] for different ages), and internalising was a protective factor (OR [95% CI] ranging from 0.95 [0.92, 0.99] to 0.90 [0.86, 0.94] for different ages). Associations between early life mental health and mid-adulthood problematic drinking did not differ by developmental timing but were stronger in males. Conclusion Our study provides new insights on links of externalising and internalising difficulties with alcohol use and has implications for public policy in the UK.",Article,1 , Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology,Mar 28,1,"

Engaging Community: Undergraduate student involvement in research as participatory method,"['Kate Luxion', 'M Svensson', 'D Frost']","Within the context of low-resource projects, both limited on time and resources, it can be difficult to incorporate equitable research methods, such as community-based participatory research. For LBGTQ+ research, there are similar barriers, with the need for health research projects that support community-led projects and centre LGBTQ+ voices through their methods. This presentation frames research methods as a social justice issue, addressing the value of community members as academic researchers; it seeks to highlight additional ways in which community involvement increases trust in both research processes and outcomes. The included examples are sub-projects and methods that are part of two distinct LGBTQ+/community-led PhD projects using either a multi-study or mixed methods approach; as such the discussion is focused on their use of qualitative methods. Coming from a social psychology perspective, themes are related to plurisexual emerging adults’ parenthood desires and plans and a biomedical study on LGBTQ+ pregnancy and parenthood, with recommendations that are transferable to other health topics. Focusing on the primary example, the presentation discusses the benefits of engaging LGBTQ+ community members assist on data processing and meaning-making while building qualitative research skills. A case study based on this postgraduate-undergraduate mentoring scheme, proposes a purposeful approach to encouraging community-led research as part of capacity building efforts for undergraduates, within and beyond academia. Information to be covered, in addition to the case study, includes how participant trust was fostered through protocols, methods, and the analysis process - with further examples pending.",Conference Paper,1 , BMJ Open,Mar 23,0,"

Global stakeholder perspectives of home birth: a systematic scoping review.,"['Ginny Brunton', 'Samira Wahab', 'Hassan Sheikh', 'Beth Murray-Davis']","Home birth is experienced by people very differently worldwide. These experiences likely differ by the type of stakeholder involved (women, their support persons, birth attendants, policy-makers), the experience itself (low-risk birth, transfer to hospital, previous deliveries), and by the health system within which home birth occurs (e.g. high-resource versus low- and middle-resource countries). Research evidence of stakeholders’ perspectives of home birth could usefully inform personal and policy decisions about choosing and providing home birth, but the current literature is fragmented and its breadth is not fully understood. We conducted a systematic scoping review to understand how the research literature on stakeholders’ perspectives of home birth is characterized in terms of populations, settings and identified issues, and what potential gaps exist in the research evidence. A range of electronic, web-based and key informant sources of evidence were searched. Located references were assessed, data extracted and analysed using robust methods. Our analysis included 387 full reports. Findings from 181 reports of studies in high-resource countries suggested that research with fathers, midwives and vulnerable populations and perspectives of freebirth and transfer to hospital could be synthesized, but gaps in primary research exist with respect to family members, policy makers, and those living in rural and remote locations. A further 206 reports of studies in low- and middle-resource countries suggested evidence for syntheses related to fathers and other family members, policy makers and other health care providers, and examination of issues related to emergency transfer to hospital, rural and remote home b

The cognitive development from childhood to adolescence of low birth weight children born after medical assisted reproduction – a UK longitudinal cohort study,"['Marco Cozzani', 'Siddartha Aradhya', 'Alice Goisis']","Background Previous research has documented that children conceived through medically assisted reproduction (MAR) are at increased risk of poor birth outcomes, such as low birthweight (LBW), which are risk factors for stunted longer-term cognitive development. However, parents who undergo MAR to conceive have, on average, advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds which could compensate for the negative effects of being born LBW. Previous studies have not analysed whether the negative effects of LBW are attenuated among MAR conceived children. Methods We draw on the UK Millennium Cohort Study (sweeps 1–6) which contains a sub-sample of (N = 396) MAR-conceived children. The dependent variable measures cognitive ability at around ages 3, 5, 7, 11 and 14. We examine the cognitive development of four groups of children: MAR-conceived low birthweight (MAR LBW); MAR-conceived non-low birthweight (MAR NLBW); naturally conceived low birthweight (NC LBW); naturally conceived non-low birthweight (NC NLBW). We estimate the two following linear regression models for each sweep: (i) a baseline model to examine the unadjusted association between cognitive development and low birthweight by mode of conception; and (ii) a model adjusted by socio-demographic family characteristics. Results In baseline models, MAR LBW children [age 3: β = 0.021, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.198, 0.241; age 5: β = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.009, 0.418; age 7: β = 0.163, 95% CI: -0.148, 0.474; age 11: β = 0.003, 95% CI: -0.318, 0.325; age 14: β = 0.156, 95% CI: -0.205, 0.517], on average perform similarly in cognitive ability relative to NC NLBW at all ages, and display higher cognitive scores than NC LBW children until a

Feasibility study of hospital antimicrobial stewardship analytics using electronic health records,"['P F Dutey-Magni', 'M J Gill', 'David McNulty[...]', 'Chris Fuller']","Background Hospital antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes are multidisciplinary initiatives to optimize antimicrobial use. Most hospitals depend on time-consuming manual audits to monitor clinicians’ prescribing. But much of the information needed could be sourced from electronic health records (EHRs). Objectives To develop an informatics methodology to analyse characteristics of hospital AMS practice using routine electronic prescribing and laboratory records. Methods Feasibility study using electronic prescribing, laboratory and clinical coding records from adult patients admitted to six specialities at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK (September 2017–August 2018). The study involved: (i) a review of AMS standards of care; (ii) their translation into concepts measurable from commonly available EHRs; and (iii) a pilot application in an EHR cohort study (n = 61679 admissions). Results We developed data modelling methods to characterize antimicrobial use (antimicrobial therapy episode linkage methods, therapy table, therapy changes). Prescriptions were linked into antimicrobial therapy episodes (mean 2.4 prescriptions/episode; mean length of therapy 5.8 days), enabling several actionable findings. For example, 22% of therapy episodes for low-severity community-acquired pneumonia were congruent with prescribing guidelines, with a tendency to use broader-spectrum antibiotics. Analysis of therapy changes revealed IV to oral therapy switching was delayed by an average 3.6 days (95% CI: 3.4–3.7). Microbial cultures were performed prior to treatment initiation in just 22% of antibacterial prescriptions. The proposed methods enabled fine-grained monitoring of

"Minority stress, distress, and suicide attempts in three cohorts of sexual minority adults: A U.S. probability sample","['Ilan H Meyer', 'Stephen Thomas Russell', 'Phillip L. Hammack[...]', 'Bianca D.M. Wilson']","During the past 50 years, there have been marked improvement in the social and legal environment of sexual minorities in the United States. Minority stress theory predicts that health of sexual minorities is predicated on the social environment. As the social environment improves, exposure to stress would decline and health outcomes would improve. We assessed how stress, identity, connectedness with the LGBT community, and psychological distress and suicide behavior varied across three distinct cohorts of sexual minority people in the United States. Using a national probability sample recruited in 2016 and 2017, we assessed three a priori defined cohorts of sexual minorities we labeled the pride (born 1956-1963), visibility (born 1974-1981), and equality (born 1990-1997) cohorts. We found significant and impressive cohort differences in coming out milestones, with members of the younger cohort coming out much earlier than members of the two older cohorts. But we found no signs that the improved social environment attenuated their exposure to minority stressors-both distal stressors, such as violence and discrimination, and proximal stressors, such as internalized homophobia and expectations of rejection. Psychological distress and suicide behavior also were not improved, and indeed were worse for the younger than the older cohorts. These findings suggest that changes in the social environment had limited impact on stress processes and mental health for sexual minority people. They speak to the endurance of cultural ideologies such as homophobia and heterosexism and accompanying rejection of and violence toward sexual minorities.",Article,1 , PLoS ONE,Mar 6,1,"

"The Dawkins effect? Celebrity scientists, (non)religious publics and changed attitudes to evolution","['Amy Unsworth', 'David Voas']","The role of science popularization remains relatively under-explored in research on contemporary public acceptance of evolution. In this study, we analyse national survey data to interrogate the role Britain’s best-known celebrity scientists David Attenborough, Brian Cox, Richard Dawkins and Stephen Hawking may have played in changing public views of evolution, as well as the role of two creationists: Ken Ham and Harun Yahya. We investigate how well known these public figures are, what their views of religion are perceived to be and, drawing on social identity theory, whether they exert different effects on attitudinal change to evolution among different religious and non-religious publics. Binary logistic regression analysis shows that among Muslim and Pentecostal Christian publics, those familiar with Dawkins as both a scientist and as someone who holds negative views of religion are more likely to have become less accepting of evolution. Conversely, among non-religious publics, Dawkins was the only celebrity scientist associated with higher odds of becoming more accepting of evolution. We suggest that engaging certain religious audiences with the science of evolutionary biology may be more effective when their religious identities are not threatened.",Article,1 , Public Understanding of Science,Feb 28,1,"

Lifelong exposure to air pollution and cognitive development in young children: the UK Millennium Cohort Study,"['Ai Milojevic', 'Peter Dutey-Magni', 'Lorraine Dearden', 'Paul Wilkinson']","Background. Evidence about the impact of air pollution on cognitive development of children has been growing but remains inconclusive. Objectives. To investigate the association of air pollution exposure and the cognitive development of children in the UK Millennium Cohort Study. Methods. Longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of 13,058-14,614 singleton births, 2000-2002, analysed at age 3, 5 and 7 years for associations between exposure from birth to selected air pollutants and cognitive scores for: School Readiness, Naming Vocabulary (age 3 and 5), Picture Similarity, Pattern Construction (age 5 and 7), Number Skills and Word Reading. Multivariable regression models took account of design stratum, clustering and sampling and attrition weights with adjustment for major risk factors, including age, gender, ethnicity, region, household income, parents' education, language, siblings and second-hand tobacco smoke. Results: In fully adjusted models, no associations were observed between pollutant exposures and cognitive scores at age 3. At age 5, particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) were associated with lower scores for Naming Vocabulary but no other outcome except for SO2 and Picture Similarity. At age 7, PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 were associated with lower scores for Pattern Construction, SO2 with lower Number Skills and SO2 and ozone with poorer Word Reading scores, but PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 were associated with higher Word Reading scores. Adverse effects of air pollutants represented a deficit of up to around 4 percentile points in Naming Vocabulary at age 5 for an interquartile range increase in pollutant conce

Sexual health promotion and contraceptive services in local authorities: a systematic review of economic evaluations 2010-2015,"['Ginny Brunton', 'Christine Michaels-Igbokwe', 'A Santos[...]', 'James Thomas']","Background Since 2013, health commissioners in England’s local authorities have been responsible for sexual health services, including contraception, HIV testing, STI testing and treatment, health education and specialist sexual health services. Effective commissioning requires information to indicate which interventions may, or may not, be cost-effective. However, current UK guidance and recent research on the cost-effectiveness of sexual health services provides patchy and fragmented evidence. This study aims systematically to review the evidence available on the cost-effectiveness of OECD-based interventions relevant to UK local authority-commissioned sexual health services. Methods Key informants, bibliographic database searches and reference lists of guidance documents and included studies were searched for potentially relevant research. Guided by key stakeholders, we sought economic evaluations of sexual health interventions within the responsibility of local authorities, and focused in the UK, on contraception and on health promotion, published between 2010 and 2015 in English. Eligible studies were full economic evaluations based in an OECD country. Studies were classified using a specifically developed tool and assessed for methodological risk of bias using one of three design-specific assessment tools. Descriptive frequencies of codes were analysed to provide a ‘map’ of research that informed stakeholder discussions to focus the subsequent synthesis. The characteristics of studies, quality ratings and cost outcomes from each included study were extracted into tables and findings summarised narratively. Studies were assessed for their relative cost-saving or cost-effectiveness according to NICE guid

A new perspective from time use research on the effects of social restrictions on COVID-19 behavioral infection risk,"['Jonathan Gershuny', 'Oriel Sullivan', 'Almudena Sevilla[...]', 'Pierre Walthery']","We present findings from three waves of a population-representative, UK time-use diary survey conducted both pre- and in real time during full ‘lockdown’, and again following the easing of social restrictions. We used an innovative online diary instrument that has proved both reliable and quick-to-field. Combining diary information on activity, location, and co-presence to estimate infection risks associated with daily behavior, we show clear changes in risk-associated behavior between the pre, full-lockdown and post full-lockdown periods. We document a shift from more to less risky daily behavior patterns (combinations of activity/location/co-presence categories) between the pre-pandemic pattern and full lockdown in May/June 2020, followed by a reversion (although not a complete reversal) of those patterns in August 2020 following the end of the first lockdown. Because, in general, a populations’ time use changes relatively slowly, the behavioral changes revealed may be interpreted as a consequence of the UK COVID-19 lockdown social restrictions and their subsequent relaxation.",Article,1 , PLoS ONE,Feb 13,1,"

Following Sen’s definition of Development as Freedom (Sen 1999), economic empowerment is an essential capability to live the life one has reason to value and can therefore be seen as an outcome of development in its own right. Gender empowerment is also one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and four of the nine targets of this goal relate directly to women’s economic empowerment (UN 2015). As a mechanism for development, there is strong longitudinal evidence that increased inclusion and participation of women in the labour market supports economic growth and development (World Bank 2012; IGC 2015; Kabeer 2012). Full participation of women in labour forces for example is estimated to add multiple percentage points to most national economic growth rates, thus increasing aggregate socio-economic development (UN 2015). Similarly, the McKinsey Global Institute estimates that if all women were able to participate fully in the economy, it would contribute up to US$ 28 trillion or 26 percent of annual global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025 (McKinsey Global Institute 2015). The potential benefits of women’s participation in the labour market underlines that the economic empowerment of women is by no means a zero-sum game: society as a whole stands to gain from it. Investing in women’s economic empowerment is smart economics (Revenga & Shetty 2012). Increasing women’s income leads to greater household spending on education and health (World Bank 2012). It also increases women’s self-esteem, aspirations, and domestic bargaining powers while reducing do

Using time use diaries to track changing behavior across successive stages of COVID-19 social restrictions,"['Jonathan Gershuny', 'Oriel Sullivan', 'Almudena Sevilla[...]', 'Pierre Walthery']","We present analyses of 24-hour time use diary records of the UK population’s activities, their social context and their location, collected in real time from four successive waves of representative UK samples, both before, and during, the current COVID-19 pandemic. We show changes in behavioral response to social restrictions at three time-points during the pandemic, including across two nationwide lockdowns. Comparing samples across the four waves, we find evidence of substantial changes in the population’s activities, locations and social interactions, which may be interpreted as direct responses to changes in regulations. One of our main motivations was to compare risk-related behavior across the first and second lockdowns. We find suggestive evidence that the second lockdown (recorded late November 2020) was less strictly adhered to than the first (recorded May- June 2020). Holding constant gender, age and social grade, the population spent on average 32 more minutes per day in high risk activities in late November 2020 than in first lockdown. Disaggregating by gender and age group, the difference was found to be statistically significant for all groups, with the exception of those aged 55 and over. Significance statement What do people do during lockdown? This set of data is unique in providing time use diary information in real time on changing behavior in the UK in response to each major change in social restrictions. This enables us to directly compare 24-hour continuous and comprehensive information on the populations’ activities, their social context and their location, comparing risk- related behavior during different phases of social restrictions.

STRONG FOUNDATIONS AND EMERGING THEMES,"['Priscilla Alderson', 'Virginia Morrow']","For researchers engaged with ethical research involving children, Priscilla Alderson and Virginia Morrow need no introduction. Their Handbook has shaped so much of what we know about ethical research involving children. Priscilla and Virginia have just released the fourth version of the Handbook (Sage 2nd edition) and we are privileged to have the opportunity to discuss this with them for this month's Expert Blog. What do you think are the challenges for research ethics today? Priscilla: I wrote the first version of the Handbook in 1995, after I'd worked with medical ethics since 1981. Doctors were taking research ethics very seriously, but many social researchers ignored ethics, or at least ignored formal review systems. During the early 2000s, I was pleased to see social research ethics and formal reviews being taken far more seriously. They continue to keep up vital high standards. But after the 'rise' in ethical awareness, we think there has partly been a 'fall'. We have written in the 2020 Handbook about the dangers of over-bureaucratic review systems that can waste months of precious research time and funding. Bureaucracy seems to be taking over many areas of our lives, but I think national and international surveys are urgently needed to uncover the extent of delays and costs as well as the gains. We know of researchers who are grateful when ethics reviews committees are helpful, supportive and raise important new questions for researchers to address. Yet there needs to be more united work among reviewers and researchers to simplify the review systems. Are there any new features in the fourth version of the Handbook?

"Stigmatization of ‘gay‐sounding’ voices: The role of heterosexual, lesbian, and gay individuals’ essentialist beliefs","['Fabio Fasoli', 'Peter Hegarty', 'David M Frost']","Voice‐based sexual orientation (SO) judgements can prompt group‐based discrimination. However, the relationships between stigmatization and essentialist beliefs about vocal cues to SO have not been researched. Two studies examined heterosexuals’ and gay men’s and lesbian women’s essentialist beliefs about voice as a cue of SO to uncover essentialist beliefs’ role in the perpetration and experience of stigma. In Study 1 (N = 363), heterosexual participants believed voice was a better cue to SO for men than for women, and participants’ belief in the discreteness, immutability, and controllability of ‘gay‐sounding’ voices was correlated with higher avoidant discrimination towards gay‐sounding men. In Study 2 (N = 147), endorsement of essentialist beliefs about voice as a SO cue was associated with self‐perceptions of sounding gay amongst gay men and lesbians. Sexual minority participants, especially gay men, who believed that they sounded gay reported more anticipation of rejection and engaged in vigilance in response. Essentialist beliefs about vocal cues to SO are relevant to explaining both the perpetration of stigma by heterosexuals and the experience of stigma for lesbians and gay men.",Article,1 , British Journal of Social Psychology,Jan 23,1,"

Family Belongingness Attenuates Entrapment and Buffers Its Association with Suicidal Ideation in a Sample of Dutch Sexual Minority Emerging Adults,"['Luis A. Parra', 'Diana D van Bergen', 'Eva Dumon[...]', 'David M Frost']","Sexual minority emerging adults are more likely to engage in suicidal ideation than their heterosexual counterparts. Experiences of homophobic violence are associated with suicidal ideation. Yet, the specific mechanisms linking homophobic violence to suicidal ideation remain unclear. Entrapment and social belongingness were tested to determine their relevance for understanding the link between homophobic violence and suicidal ideation. A sample of sexual minority Dutch emerging adults (N = 675; ages 18–29, M = 21.93 years, SD = 3.20) were recruited through online platforms and flyers. Homophobic violence was expected to be positively associated with suicidal ideation and entrapment. The association between homophobic violence and suicidal ideation was expected to be indirectly linked through entrapment. We explored whether various sources of social belongingness moderated the path between entrapment and suicidal ideation and whether those sources of social belongingness moderated the indirect effect of homophobic violence on suicidal ideation through entrapment. Results showed that homophobic violence and entrapment were positively associated with suicidal ideation and that family belongingness was negatively associated with suicidal ideation. Homophobic violence and suicidal ideation were not indirectly linked through entrapment. The interaction effect between entrapment and family belongingness was significant, suggesting that, on average, the effect of entrapment on suicidal ideation decreased when family belongingness was high. These results suggest that family belongingness may reduce the association between entrapment and suicidal ideation while adjusting for homophonic violence. Reducing entrapment and impr

‘Punishing those who do the wrong thing’: Enforcing destitution and debt through the UK’s family migration rules,"['Eve Dickson', 'Rachel Rosen']","In 2012, the ‘no recourse to public funds’ (NRPF) condition was extended to long-standing migrant families in the UK who had previously achieved rights to residence and welfare through human rights mechanisms. Through close examination of policy, political statements, and media coverage, we make the case that the NRPF extension was – and continues to be – intentionally subjugating and punitive, most aptly understood as a policy of enforced destitution and debt imposed on negatively-racialised post-colonial subjects. In drawing out the implications of our argument, we point to time, destitution, and debt as core technologies of the UK’s migration regime, alongside everyday bordering, detention, and deportability. Denying support through NRPF serves to exclude putatively included migrants while normalising conditional approaches to social support. Our article reveals why moral arguments against NRPF based on destitution fail and suggests that challenging welfare bordering requires a more systemic appraisal of policy frames, intentions and effects.",Article,0 , Critical Social Policy,Jan 6,0,"

PrEP is one of the most effective biomedical HIV prevention strategies; however, use among gay and bisexual men remains low within the United States. This study used a national probability sample of gay and bisexual men from three age cohorts of men (18–25, 34–41, and 52–59 years at wave 1) who completed three annual surveys between March 2016 and March 2018 (N at wave 1 = 624). Recruitment occurred through a Gallup dual-frame sampling procedure; results for this study came from eligible individuals who consented to be part of the self-administered online or mailed survey questionnaire. We used descriptive data with sampling weights to understand trends in PrEP familiarity, PrEP attitudes and PrEP use across all three time points. Next, PrEP uptake and discontinuation were assessed among men completing all three surveys and who remained eligible for PrEP at all three time points (N = 181). PrEP familiarity increased considerably between 2016 and 2018 among those eligible for PrEP (from 59.8% from wave 1 to 92.0% at wave 3). Favorable attitudes toward PrEP increased more modestly (from 68.3% at wave 1 to 72.7% at wave 3). While PrEP use increased by 90% between the two time points (from 4.1% in 2016 to 7.8% in 2018), this represented a small percentage of overall uptake among eligible participants across time (6.6%). Among respondents who reported PrEP use at wave 1 or wave 2, 33.3% subsequently discontinued PrEP use at a later wave.

This chapter analyses data from a unique sample of essays written by members of the National Child Development Study (NCDS), the 1958 British birth cohort study, when they were eleven years old in 1969, on the topic of ‘Imagine you are twenty-five…’. It explores girls’ accounts of their imagined future family lives, focusing in particular how they imagined combining paid and domestic work. It aims to highlight children’s writing as a resource for research, and demonstrates that however cursory the task children are asked to undertake, they are creative, constructive and innovative in their responses, and that what they create may tell us something about their current circumstances and social context, and about their capacity for keen, perceptive observation. However, the chapter also urges caution and suggests that we need to retain a critical stance towards the utility of asking children to predict their futures.",Chapter,,,Jan 1,0,"
