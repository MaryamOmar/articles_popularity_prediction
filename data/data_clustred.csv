This study places the role of social media affordances in facilitating the spread of conspiracy beliefs at the center of its enquiry. We examine the relationship between platform use and conspiracy theory beliefs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Relying on the concept of technological affordances, we theorize that variation across key features make some platforms more fertile places for conspiracy beliefs than others. Using data from a crossnational dataset based on a two-wave online survey conducted in 17 countries before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we show that Twitter has a negative effect on conspiracy beliefs—as opposed to all other platforms under examination which are found to have a positive effect.","[0.011248, 0.0, 0.13278853, 0.0, 0.00059997, 0.02139743, 0.01126458, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00374594, 0.0, 0.01282312]",covid,"[1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Fifteen international laboratories experienced in performing tests for ANA by indirect immunofluorescence participated in analyzing coded sera from healthy individuals and from patients in the 5 different disease groups described above. Except for the stipulation that HEp-2 cells should be used as substrate, each laboratory used its own in-house methodology so that the data might be expected to reflect the output of a cross-section of worldwide ANA reference laboratories. The sera were analyzed at 4 dilutions: 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, and 1:320. In healthy individuals, the frequency of ANA did not differ significantly across the 4 age subgroups spanning 20-60 years of age. This putatively normal population was ANA positive in 31.7% of individuals at 1:40 serum dilution, 13.3% at 1:80, 5.0% at 1:160, and 3.3% at 1:320. In comparison with the findings among the disease groups, a low cutoff point at 1:40 serum dilution (high sensitivity, low specificity) could have diagnostic value, since it would classify virtually all patients with SLE, SSc, or SS as ANA positive. Conversely, a high positive cutoff at 1:160 serum dilution (high specificity, low sensitivity) would be useful to confirm the presence of disease in only a portion of cases, but would be likely to exclude 95% of normal individuals.

Systems-level analysis of how flaviviruses hijack cellular processes through virus-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs) provides information about their replication and pathogenic mechanisms. We used affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to compare flavivirus-host interactions for two viruses (DENV and ZIKV) in two hosts (human and mosquito). Conserved virus-host PPIs revealed that the flavivirus NS5 protein suppresses interferon stimulated genes by inhibiting recruitment of the transcription complex PAF1C and that chemical modulation of SEC61 inhibits DENV and ZIKV replication in human and mosquito cells. Finally, we identified a ZIKV-specific interaction between NS4A and ANKLE2, a gene linked to hereditary microcephaly, and showed that ZIKV NS4A causes microcephaly in Drosophila in an ANKLE2-dependent manner. Thus, comparative flavivirus-host PPI mapping provides biological insights and, when coupled with in vivo models, can be used to unravel pathogenic mechanisms.

It is a pre-emptive intervention, especially targeted at structurally weak economies with rising Euroscepticism, to avoid costly ex-post bailouts as in the Great Recession. We demonstrate, using quantitative analysis, that pre-existing vulnerabilities, rather than the impact of the pandemic, drove the allocation of NGEU resources: per capita grants largely correspond to past economic vulnerabilities, as well as to political ones. Countries most vulnerable to another adjustment by austerity after the Covid-19 economic crisis receive most resources. Also, countries with strong anti-EU sentiments are entitled to larger NGEU grants per capita. In contrast, grants are not correlated with the severity of the health crisis. Then we show the domestic relevance of economic and political vulnerabilities through qualitative case studies of national political debates and domestic positions on NGEU in Italy, Germany and the Netherlands. Despite its innovative traits, NGEU is a politically constrained solution to address the mess from the previous decade, and as such, it is a Janus solution: promising a fresh start, but haunted by the past.","[0.05445248, 0.0, 0.06544958, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00547637, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01078994]",covid,"[9.99999000e-01 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

Modern New Guineans inherited a unique genetic diversity tracing back 50,000 years, and yet there is currently no model reconstructing their past population dynamics. We generated 58 new whole genome sequences from Papua New Guinea, filling geographical gaps in previous sampling, specifically to address alternative scenarios of the initial migration to Sahul and the settlement of New Guinea. Here, we present the first genomic models for the settlement of northeast Sahul considering one or two migrations from Wallacea. Both models fit our dataset, reinforcing the idea that ancestral groups to New Guinean and Indigenous Australians split early, potentially during their migration in Wallacea where the northern route could have been favored. The earliest period of human presence in Sahul was an era of interactions and gene flow between related but already differentiated groups, from whom all modern New Guineans, Bismarck islanders and Indigenous Australians descend. The settlement of New Guinea was probably initiated from its southeast region, where the oldest archaeological sites have been found. This was followed by two migrations into the south and north lowlands that ultimately reached the west and east highlands. We also identify ancient gene flows between populations in New Guinea, Australia, East Indonesia and the Bismarck Archipelago, emphasizing the fact that the anthropological landscape during the early period of Sahul settlement was highly dynamic rather than the traditional view of extensive isolation.","[0.04903064, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00483081, 0.00297689, 0.0, 0.03010046, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0059798, 0.0, 0.02315264]",politics,"[1.14260799e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

We present an advanced stochastic-ecological model to test the relative support for scenarios describing where and when the first humans entered Sahul, and their most probable routes of early settlement. The model supports a dominant entry via the northwest Sahul Shelf first, potentially followed by a second entry through New Guinea, with initial entry most consistent with 50,000 or 75,000 years ago based on comparison with bias-corrected archaeological map layers. The model’s emergent properties predict that peopling of the entire continent occurred rapidly across all ecological environments within 156–208 human generations (4368–5599 years) and at a plausible rate of 0.71–0.92 km year−1.

Taking Pakistan's ethno nationalist Mohajir party, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) as a case study, it explores how certain men from the ethnic community of Mohajirs are recruited to the roles and statuses of political killers, and sustain violence as a primary social identity and lifestyle over a period of some years. By drawing on detailed fieldwork in areas involved in the Karachi conflict, the author contributes to understandings of violence, tracing the development of violent aspects of Mohajir nationalism via an exploration of political and cultural contexts of Pakistan's history, and highlighting the repetitive homology of the conflict with the earlier violence of Partition. Through a local comparison of ethnic and religious militancy she also updates the current situation of social and cultural change in Karachi, which is dominantly framed in terms of Islamist radicalization and modernization. In her examination, governance and civil society issues are integrated with the political and psychological dimensions of mobilization processes and violence at micro-, meso- and macro- levels.

Rachel and Mark worked together in a student-supervisor relationship, firstly on the MA Education and then on the Doctorate in Education (EdD) programmes, jointly offered by the Mauritius Institute of Education and the University of Brighton, UK. Rachel's research considers narrative and autoethnographic inquiry into educational professionalism, agency and becoming and parallels Mark's own research interest and experience. Our reflections were developed through a series of email exchanges and online discussions, theorised through meta-reflection and analysis. Informed by postcolonial perspectives, the paper notes that the complexity and inequalities of power distribution in such a transnational supervisory relationship are likely to be compounded through shifts to online only encounters.

In the introduction to this special issue, we briefly chart the intellectual genealogy of political ecology, identify vital challenges faced today, and present a new set of studies that respond to these concerns. We conceptualize power as a social relation built on the asymmetrical distribution of resources and risks and locate power in the interactions among, and the processes that constitute, people, places, and resources. Politics, then, are found in the practices and mechanisms through which such power is circulated. The focus here is on politics related to the environment, understood as biophysical phenomena, together with human knowledge and practice. To apply these concepts, we promote multiscale research models that articulate selected ecological phenomena and local social processes, together with regional and global forces and ideas. We also advocate methods for research and practice that are sensitive to relations of difference and power among and within social groups. Rather than dilute ecological dimensions of study, this approach aims to strengthen our ability to account for the dialectical processes through which humans appropriate, contest, and manipulate the world around them.","[0.15117648, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00353778, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",politics,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

In order to take stock of the state of female entrepreneurship on that continent, this paper examines articles published in peer-reviewed journals over the period 1987 to 2019. Using a mixed embeddedness approach, the analysis of these articles shows how cultural, institutional, economic, political, and social contexts shape the resources and strategies used by female entrepreneurs, and in turn, the interactions between the contexts, resources, and strategies determine the outcomes of female entrepreneurship in Africa. We argue that the environments in which female entrepreneurs are embedded lead to the development of innovative strategies and ways of gaining access to diverse resources. More papers on female entrepreneurship in Africa were published between 2015 and 2019 than in the previous 27 years.

The first was characterized by a cultural consciousness enabled by Enlightenment thought but articulated as ""Eastern"" culture; the second, nationalism's power in mobilizing the population, based on a notion of the nonpassive ""Oriental""; and the final, the hegemonic resolution of the non-Western nation with the liberal state and the postcolonial state's entry into Western modernity. Chatterjee claimed general relevance for his theoretical framework and this is what generates this analysis. The theme of this essay is a dual one: it is, one, an account of Jagan's nationalist discourse during the initial period of Guyana's trek from colonial territory to postcolonial state through, two, a critical adaptation of Chatterjee's framework. One of the most important aspects of the critique of Nationalist Thought and the Colonial World involves the ontology of culture, an element that is central to Chatterjee's argument. What I hope to produce is a way of reading the difference between the general framework of Nationalist Thought, which takes India as its case study, and the particular manifestation of Guyanese nationalist thought. That is, by way of metaphor, the difference between a title like Towards Freedom and Forbidden Freedom. One of the tasks of postcolonial theory is to locate agency on the part of the colonial subjects, to find a way for those figures to make visible their subjectivity.

Wearing protective equipment like mask and gloves, washing hands via soap, frequent use of antiseptic solution and maintaining social distance are being applied globally to reduce the transmission rate. Therefore, this study was intended to investigate water, sanitation and hygienic (WASH) behaviour, protective equipment use and their disposal practices among Bangladeshi residents amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the study aims, data were collected mainly via an online survey and analysed through a set of statistical tools including T test, one-way ANOVA and principal component analysis (PCA). This study found that almost 89.80% of the respondents reported to know about the COVID-19 and its preventive measures. WASH status of the respondents is found quite good, where 94.60% stated to have available potable water, 99% have improved toilet facilities, 95% wash their hands via soap, and 79.80% clean their house and toilets by antiseptic solutions properly. Moreover, nearly 94.50% and 54.80% people reported to use face mask and hand gloves, respectively, but the disposal practice of these protective equipment is inappropriate. More than 50% of people reported disposing of their used mask, gloves and tissue with other household wastes, which is alarming for public health and environmental perspective.

In this paper,we argue that these border agreements have increasingly resulted in a changing experience of sovereign power for those crossing the border. This is demonstrated through a discussion of: the major border policies between Canada and the US since 11 September 2001, developed under the influence of US hegemony; how these policies perpetrate a generalised state of exception; and how these policies affect refugees,migrants, and citizens. Reading Agamben’s insights from a sociological perspective, we argue that the presumption of security-through-surveillance erodes border crossers’ human rights, and that some people – those from disadvantaged race/class backgrounds – aremore affected than others by the implementation of the evolving border regime. We also emphasise the contingencies and unintended consequences of the ongoing projects.

This qualitative study involved interviewing autistic individuals (N = 20) in-person, via a video-based platform, a text-based platform, or over email to investigate ACC. Critical grounded theory tools were used to collect and analyse the data. There were three elements of ACC: belongingness, social connectedness, and political connectedness. Belongingness referred to the sense of similarity that autistic people experienced with each other. Social connectedness referred to specific friendship participants formed with other autistic people. Political connectedness referred to a connectedness to the political or social equality goals of the autistic community. Participants described the benefits of ACC as being increased self-esteem, a sense of direction, and a sense of community not experienced elsewhere.

But we found no signs that the improved social environment attenuated their exposure to minority stressors-both distal stressors, such as violence and discrimination, and proximal stressors, such as internalized homophobia and expectations of rejection. Psychological distress and suicide behavior also were not improved, and indeed were worse for the younger than the older cohorts. These findings suggest that changes in the social environment had limited impact on stress processes and mental health for sexual minority people. They speak to the endurance of cultural ideologies such as homophobia and heterosexism and accompanying rejection of and violence toward sexual minorities.","[0.0, 0.24009911, 0.05692505, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00512958, 0.00348586, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00330645, 0.0]",sexuality,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01 9.99999e-01

Two studies examined heterosexuals’ and gay men’s and lesbian women’s essentialist beliefs about voice as a cue of SO to uncover essentialist beliefs’ role in the perpetration and experience of stigma. In Study 1 (N = 363), heterosexual participants believed voice was a better cue to SO for men than for women, and participants’ belief in the discreteness, immutability, and controllability of ‘gay‐sounding’ voices was correlated with higher avoidant discrimination towards gay‐sounding men. In Study 2 (N = 147), endorsement of essentialist beliefs about voice as a SO cue was associated with self‐perceptions of sounding gay amongst gay men and lesbians. Sexual minority participants, especially gay men, who believed that they sounded gay reported more anticipation of rejection and engaged in vigilance in response. Essentialist beliefs about vocal cues to SO are relevant to explaining both the perpetration of stigma by heterosexuals and the experience of stigma for lesbians and gay men.","[0.0, 0.11095059, 0.0, 0.0687367, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00902908, 0.0, 0.00144556, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",sexuality,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

Space agencies such as NASA and ESA have ambitious long-term programmes of science and discovery that mark the beginning of a new era in space exploration where humans will be sent to Mars; An era that requires public support and, therefore, more consideration for public opinion. This study shows that the British public who come to outreach and engagement activities consider the advancement of UK space activities nationally to be of interest. In 2008, over 700 Britons were surveyed at two space outreach events in the UK, the Royal Society Summer Exhibition in London and the National Space Centre in Leicester, to determine their attitudes to space exploration. When asked about means to explore space, the majority agreed that space should be explored both by mankind and machines, scoring ""generating new scientific knowledge and advance human culture"" as the most important reason for keeping exploring space. Although the greater number of supporters said that more money should be allocated to civil space activities, there were some concerns about risk and value. This paper will investigate the views and attitudes towards space exploration of this segment of the population and how it may relate to support for space exploration.","[0.04667902, 0.00271405, 0.00497694, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00387636, 0.01706545, 0.00427357, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01205774, 0.03219376]",politics,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01

In the introduction to this special issue, we briefly chart the intellectual genealogy of political ecology, identify vital challenges faced today, and present a new set of studies that respond to these concerns. We conceptualize power as a social relation built on the asymmetrical distribution of resources and risks and locate power in the interactions among, and the processes that constitute, people, places, and resources. Politics, then, are found in the practices and mechanisms through which such power is circulated. The focus here is on politics related to the environment, understood as biophysical phenomena, together with human knowledge and practice. To apply these concepts, we promote multiscale research models that articulate selected ecological phenomena and local social processes, together with regional and global forces and ideas. We also advocate methods for research and practice that are sensitive to relations of difference and power among and within social groups. Rather than dilute ecological dimensions of study, this approach aims to strengthen our ability to account for the dialectical processes through which humans appropriate, contest, and manipulate the world around them.","[0.15117648, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00353778, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",politics,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

The chapter discusses the history of online CSE, focusing on regulatory stances over time in which online risks to children have been cast as natural and inevitable by the hegemony of a “cyber-libertarian” ideology. We illustrate the success of this ideology, as well as its profound contradictions and ethical failures, by presenting key examples in which internet users have taken decisive action to prevent online CSE and promote the removal of CSAM. Rejecting simplistic characterizations of “vigilante justice,” we argue instead that the fact that often young internet users are being forced to act against online CSE and CSAM puts a lie to libertarian claims that internet regulation is impossible, unworkable, and unwanted. Recent shifts towards a more progressive ethos of online harm minimization are promising, however, this ethos risks offering a new legitimizing ideology for online business models that will continue to put children at risk of abuse and exploitation. In conclusion, we suggest ways forward toward an internet built in the interests of children, rather than profit.","[0.00431511, 0.07304869, 0.00425463, 0.0, 0.01702789, 0.0341683, 0.0, 0.1475184, 0.0, 0.01850944, 0.0, 0.00091311]",child_family,"[9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01

The traditional story – of a game created by ‘gentlemen’ but taken up, and ultimately dominated, by ‘ruffians’ – has been challenged by a revisionist account which presents football as an ancient ‘people’s’ or ‘plebeian’ game, briefly hijacked by upper-middle class men in the mid-Victorian period, before returning to its ‘popular’ roots from the 1880s onwards. This article suggests that, as currently conducted, the debate is both conceptually confused and bedevilled by paucity of sources. The conceptual problems derive partly from an endemic vagueness in the historical use of the term ‘football’, and partly from a persistent tendency to conflate football play with rules of play. The paucity of sources is well-known in the study of football as a medieval and early modern folk pastime. But it is also an issue in studying early forms of club football. This article uses a hitherto underused source – the match reports of the earliest amateur football clubs in Britain – as part of an attempt to address the conceptual confusion and also to present a genuinely new account of the impact of traditional ‘folk’ football on the modern game.

This stands in contrast to the common assumption that relations arise when subjects interact, an account that gives logical priority to separation. We will develop this relational understanding through a reading of the work of Martin Buber, a social philosopher primarily interested in dialogue, meeting, relationship, and the irreducibility and incomparability of reality. In particular, the article contrasts Buber’s work with that of poststructuralist theorists who take as their starting point the deconstruction of the Hegelian logic of binary oppositions. Deconstruction understands difference as the excess that undoes the binary, but Buber, we argue, shows how difference derives from the primacy and ontological undefinability of relation.

To date, no systematic review of the use of digital storytelling in a research capacity, to generate information about a phenomenon has been conducted. Accordingly, our aim was to provide a systematic review of digital storytelling in research. The review identified 25 articles representing 23 discrete studies that met inclusion criteria. A thematic analysis of results indicated that digital storytelling in research was especially appropriate for use with marginalised groups, and was most commonly used in this context. There was some variation in the extent to which digital storytelling in research adhered to the principles with which it was originally developed. Surprisingly, although digital storytelling provides a ready-made knowledge translation product, few research projects employed the digital stories generated to this end. Across research projects, participants reported several benefits of digital storytelling. While some disadvantages were noted, overall, these were outweighed by the benefits of using a respectful, participatory research practice. © 2017: Adële de Jager, Andrea Fogarty, Anna Tewson, Caroline Lenette, Katherine M.

Their support-seeking behaviour is also under-researched. Based on findings from 25 interviews and a focus group discussion, this qualitative study presents insights into the effects of providing informal care on the lives of young carers and their support-seeking behaviour. Participants reported several physical, mental, and social effects of caring that have either positive or negative implications for their lives. Whereas providing care influenced early maturity, self-efficacy, and formation of stronger bonds with care recipients, it also limited participants’ ability to find work, focus on their education, and socialise with peers. Utilisation of formal community-based and professional support services was low among the participants. Stigma associated with the label “carer”; lack of youth-friendly service settings; lack of self-identification of carer status; and a lack of cultural, age, and specific support services for different stages of caring constrained the use of support services among participants. In contrast, positive attitudes of service providers encouraged the use of support services. These findings highlight an urgent need for more professional support for young carers. • IMPLICATIONS • Failure to provide sufficient professional support to young carers can aggravate the negative consequences associated with their caring roles. • Social workers and other professionals can strengthen their collaboration with educators, work supervisors, and other support agencies to address the challenges of providing care at a young age. • Given that caring roles

The aim of this paper is threefold: (1) to develop a framework for child-centred design analysis, (2) to analyse children’s designs to explore both quantitative and qualitative insights and (3) to explore how children’s voice could be elevated through design research. A Child-centred Design Analysis Framework is developed in an interdisciplinary manner, comprising four dimensions including Child, Content, Context and Format. It is used as a vehicle to analyse and code 130 ‘Dream Wheelchair’ designs by children. The children’s ‘Dream Wheelchair’ designs reference a range of features and priorities, which are gathered into themes through the framework, providing insights into children’s individual and collective mobility narratives, values and requirements. Themes are explored through a qualitative interdisciplinary lens to understand the nature of children’s lived experiences. The framework promotes child-centred framing through extracting meaning from children’s own designs. It is suggested that child-centred framing and a rights-respecting approach to assistive technology design research can lead to more appropriate design outcomes and improved user experiences for children with disabilities.","[0.00323555, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00140946, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2576743, 0.0, 0.00304721, 0.00725808, 0.008185]",child_family,"[1.70182270e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.34983164e-06 8.26993186e-05

Laboratory investigations of eating behavior in both humans and animals established key roles for palatability and variety in stimulating appetite, delaying satiety, and promoting excessive energy intake. There is a robust effect of food palatability and variety on short-term food intake, and increased variety and palatability also cause weight gain in animal models. However, laboratory paradigms do not replicate the complexities of eating in a natural setting, and there is a shortage of evidence to estimate the magnitude of effects on weight in humans. There are substantial individual differences in susceptibility to the palatability effect and this may be a key determinant in individual vulnerability to weight gain.

While Hilbert spaces with higher dimensionality, e.g., spatial modes of light, allow higher information capacity per photon, such spatial mode entanglement transport requires custom multimode fiber and is limited by decoherence-induced mode coupling. Here, we circumvent this by transporting multidimensional entangled states down conventional single-mode fiber (SMF). By entangling the spin-orbit degrees of freedom of a biphoton pair, passing the polarization (spin) photon down the SMF while accessing multiple orbital angular momentum (orbital) subspaces with the other, we realize multidimensional entanglement transport. We show high-fidelity hybrid entanglement preservation down 250 m SMF across multiple 2 × 2 dimensions, confirmed by quantum state tomography, Bell violation measures, and a quantum eraser scheme. This work offers an alternative approach to spatial mode entanglement transport that facilitates deployment in legacy networks across conventional fiber.","[0.02403408, 0.0, 0.00243665, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00259352, 0.027502, 0.0, 0.00157362, 0.0, 0.00087942, 0.00152147]",health_medicine,"[9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

The enzymatic production of isoquercitrin from rutin catalyzed by hesperidinase is feasible; however, the bioprocess is hindered by low substrate concentration and a long reaction time. Thus, a novel biphase system consisting of [Bmim][BF4]:glycine-sodium hydroxide (pH 9) (10:90, v/v) and glyceryl triacetate (1:1, v/v) was initially established for isoquercitrin production. The biotransformation product was identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the bonding mechanism of the enzyme and substrate was inferred using circular dichroism spectra and kinetic parameters. The highest rutin conversion of 99.5% and isoquercitrin yield of 93.9% were obtained after 3 h. The reaction route is environmentally benign and mild, and the biphase system could be reused. The substrate concentration was increased 2.6-fold, the reaction time was reduced to three tenths the original time. The three-dimensional structure of hesperidinase was changed in the biphase system, which α-helix and random content were reduced and β-sheet content was increased.

SP cells were identified and characterized by flow cytometry using Hoechst 33342 dye staining from a highly metastatic human pancreatic cancer cell line (L3.6pl). Antagomir transfection was performed using miRNA-21 and miRNA-221 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and followed by detection of cell apoptosis, cell cycle progression, chemosensitivity, and invasion. Sorted SP cells from gemcitabine-resistant L3.6pl cells (L3.6plGres-SP) cells were orthotopically implanted in nude mice with or without miRNA-21 and miRNA-221 ASOs mono- and combination therapy. The administration of antagomir-21 and antagomir-221 significantly reduced the SP cell fraction, decreased SP cell differentiation, and downstream gene regulation, and thereby induced reduction of L3.6pl cell proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance against gemcitabine and 5-Fluorouracil. Combination of ASOs therapy against miRNA-21 and miRNA-221 significantly inhibited primary tumor growth and metastasis compared to single antagomir treatment, especially, in L3.6plGres-SP-induced pancreatic tumor growth in vivo.

Exploring factors that may heighten or buffer the risk of mental health problems in this context is thus critical. Whilst compassion may be a protective factor, in contrast fears of compassion increase vulnerability to psychosocial distress and may amplify the impact of the pandemic on mental health. This study explores the magnifying effects of fears of compassion on the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on depression, anxiety and stress, and social safeness. Methods: Adult participants from the general population (N = 4057) were recruited across 21 countries worldwide, and completed self-report measures of perceived threat of COVID-19, fears of compassion (for self, from others, for others), depression, anxiety, stress, and social safeness. Results: Perceived threat of COVID-19 predicted increased depression, anxiety and stress. The three flows of fears of compassion predicted higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress and lower social safeness. All fears of compassion moderated (heightened) the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on psychological distress. Only fears of compassion from others moderated the effects of likelihood of contracting COVID-19 on social safeness. These effects were consistent across all countries. Conclusions: Fears of compassion have a universal magnifying effect on the damaging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and social safeness. Compassion focused interventions and communications could be implemented to reduce resistances to compassion and promote mental wellbeing during and following the pandemic.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.29259372, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",covid,"[1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 1.32028722e-06 1.00000000e-06

Based on previous underlying theory of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), the initial 50-item scale of AFQ converged into a short 8-item scale for youth (Greco, Lambert, & Baer 2008). The short version of the AFQ questionnaire (AFQ-Y8) was used. The AFQ was adapted in Greek and administered to high school students (mean age=14.79, SD=1.058) in the context of two larger studies from which results were merged to examine the questionnaires’ psychometric properties. An exploratory factor analysis with principal components extraction and an oblique rotation revealed a single factor accounting for 43.08% of the variability. A reliability analysis showed a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of .81 for the factor. The next step was to ensure that the AFQ-Y8 is correlated with theoretically expected outcomes (concurrent and predictive validity), thus, results will be presented as an explanation for its predictive and convergent validity testing the AFQ-Y8 with related and unrelated measures. Based on the results, AFQ-Y8 appears to have adequate internal consistency in the Greek speaking population. In conclusion, the Greek AFQ-Y8 is a useful tool in evaluating psychological inflexibility and for group-based research in adolescents. Theoretical and clinical implications will be discussed.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.00010504, 0.0, 0.00582528, 0.04247231, 0.0990669, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06 9.99999e-01 1.00000e-06

The ensuing discussion points out that the life of excellence (arête) in all classical Greek philosophy culminates in the attainment of eudemonic being, equivocating likeness to the divine to the highest possible degree. The paper goes on to disclose significant differences concerning happiness between the moral and political philosophy of Aristotle and that of his predecessors, Socrates, and Plato. In turn, the present inquiry explores Aristotle's claim in EN that the education of a sufficient number of citizens of superior refinement best accomplishes human flourishing in both the private and public spheres. According to Aristotle, the paramount achievement of eudaimonia in individuals and the city-state happens through the moral and intellectual education of citizens of refinement in political science (politike episteme). Consequently, the present exploration carefully investigates the crux of Aristotle's vision of educating citizens of quality as this aspect of his ethics best illumines the holistic aim scope and curriculum of his proposed study in politike episteme (the science integrating all sciences). Finally, the present endeavor explores the superiority that Aristotle allots to contemplative or divine theoria in the latter part of his ethical treatise (Book X.7-8), where, he establishes a hierarchy between phrõnesis (practical wisdom) and theoria (contemplative wisdom), ascertaining the higher standing of the latter, a claim that inevitably leads him into paradox.

Lack of social support, psychiatric history, childhood trauma, additional stressful events in the past month, and low resilience predicted more mental health problems for COVID-19 and other stressful events. Higher COVID-19 country impact was associated with increased mental health impact of both COVID-19 and other stressful events.

The impact of these lockdowns on mental health is inadequately understood. On the one hand such drastic changes in daily routines could be detrimental to mental health. On the other hand, it might not be experienced negatively, especially because the entire population was affected. Methods The aim of this study was to determine mental health outcomes during pandemic induced lockdowns and to examine known predictors of mental health outcomes. We therefore surveyed n = 9,565 people from 78 countries and 18 languages. Outcomes assessed were stress, depression, affect, and wellbeing. Predictors included country, sociodemographic factors, lockdown characteristics, social factors, and psychological factors. Results Results indicated that on average about 10% of the sample was languishing from low levels of mental health and about 50% had only moderate mental health. Importantly, three consistent predictors of mental health emerged: social support, education level, and psychologically flexible (vs. rigid) responding. Poorer outcomes were most strongly predicted by a worsening of finances and not having access to basic supplies. Conclusions These results suggest that on whole, respondents were moderately mentally healthy at the time of a population-wide lockdown. The highest level of mental health difficulties were found in approximately 10% of the population. Findings suggest that public health initiatives should target people without social support and those whose finances worsen as a result of the lockdown.

Numerous studies have supported the association of adverse childhood experiences with non-suicidal self-injury. However, the majority of the measures used were limited to basic forms of abuse and neglect, indicating a need for the use of a more inclusive measure, such as the ACE-IQ. The psychometric properties of the measure though have only been briefly investigated with other populations, suggesting that a more thorough examination might be beneficial before its use. Method: Two hundred eighty-four adult participants (77.5% females) with a mean age of 23.4 (SD=5.7) were recruited online via specific self-harm groups on social media platforms. Participants were asked to complete an online survey consisting of three self-report measures regarding early childhood experiences and engagement in non-suicidal self-injury. Results: The findings of this study supported ACE-IQ’s reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.854), convergent validity (r= 0.85, p<0.001 with the CTQ-SF), predictive validity (R² = 0.12, p=0.001 of the SHI total score) and discriminant validity (F-value = 13.90, p<0.001).

In the domain of mating, these interests, along with other factors such as the trade-offs inherent in mating, give rise to an opportunity cost of free mate choice: Parents have much to lose if they allow their children to exercise choice freely. This opportunity cost provides a strong incentive to parents to influence their children's mate choices. In preindustrial societies, parents manage to exercise direct control, which is predominantly manifested in the institution of arranged marriage. In postindustrial societies, parents exercise influence indirectly through manipulation. Ultimately, parental influence over mating gives rise to a sexual selection force, namely parental choice, which may be unique to the human species.","[0.00705535, 0.02995217, 0.0, 0.00815108, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.19176712, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",child_family,"[1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06 1.00000e-06

Our findings highlight both cultural universals and cultural variation. We find a universal negative relation between appropriateness ratings of norm violations and appropriateness ratings of responses in the form of confrontation, social ostracism and gossip. Moreover, we find the country variation in the appropriateness of sanctions to be consistent across different norm violations but not across different sanctions. Specifically, in those countries where use of physical confrontation and social ostracism is rated as less appropriate, gossip is rated as more appropriate.","[0.0115074, 0.00467255, 0.02696806, 0.00361383, 0.0, 0.06621058, 0.01693575, 0.0, 0.00743619, 0.00984939, 0.0, 0.01640423]",education,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 1.00000000e-06

Key to this is activating and increasing citizen participation in a fractal-like, multi scaled, community-led, bottom up planning process, where active citizens design, construct and are part of the futures they desire for their territories. 2019’s declarations of climate emergency show that decades of sustainable development have not worked. The Sustainable Development Goals are a positive step, but sustainability’s dependence on economic growth is problematic. Recognising Earth’s limits, this article builds on degrowth ideas and doughnut economic frameworks to examine the role of community-led urban transitions in catalysing a regenerative world, where ecocities are the normative goal of contemporary cities. Challenges in scaling the Global Ecovillage Network’s process to large cities are identified and some radical governance experiments examined. Attempting to bridge activism and academia, a transdisciplinary participative action research method is used to develop a Communities of Practice ecosystem to support an eco-social just transition. This work contributes to the European Network for Community-Led Initiatives on Climate Change and Sustainability, ECOLISE, the Horizon 2020 project UrbanA investigating Sustainable and Just Cities, and the Communities for Future action platform enabling translocal communities to connect, co-create a knowledge commons and help shape policy.

These results persisted after controlling for individual- and country-level variables. Moreover, the BJW effect was stronger on the legitimation of the Bottom 10% incomes, compared to the legitimation of the Top 10%.

The analysis takes into consideration the structural dynamics that define how young people live their transitions and their identity construction nowadays to contextualize what appears as individual experiences and projects without reifying the individual as a privileged site of knowledge. Based on in-deph comprehensive interviews, the author demonstrates that the engagement of young people in this permanent body modification project represents an embodied struggle for the maintenance of a desired subjectivity.

Predictive policing is, at the same time, one of the drivers of the birth, and the ultimate material enactment of, the anticipatory logics that are central to the smart city discourse. Quite surprisingly, however, critical analyses of the smart city have remained divorced from critical criminology and police studies. To fill this gap, this article sets out the first critical, in-depth empirical discussion of Blue CRUSH, a predictive policing program developed in Memphis (TN, USA), where its implementation intersects long-term austerity for urban policy. The article, first, shows that there is no evidence of Blue CRUSH’s capacity to prevent crime, thus adding empirical material to skepticism over the role of predictive policing as a policy solution in the first place. And, second, it argues that, rather than making crime a matter of technological solutions, predictive policing shifts the politics therein – in short, it contributes to the expansion of policing into the field of urban policy at the same time as it disrupts present police work.

Inner transformation relates to various aspects of human existence and interactions such as consciousness, mindsets, values, worldviews, beliefs, spirituality and human–nature connectedness. The article draws on Meadows’ leverage points approach, as places to intervene in a system, to reveal the relevance of inner transformation for system change towards sustainability. Based on insights from a series of dialogue and reflection workshops and a literature review, this article provides three important contributions to sustainability transformations research: first, it increases our conceptual understanding of inner transformation and its relevance for sustainability; second, it outlines concrete elements of the inner transformation-sustainability nexus in relation to leverage points; and third, it presents practical examples illustrating how to work with leverage points for supporting inner transformation. In sum, the paper develops a systematized and structured approach to understanding inner transformation, including the identification of deep, i.e., highly influential, leverage points. In addition, it critically discusses the often contentious and divergent perspectives on inner transformation and shows related practical challenges.

The first half of the article highlights the opportunities that online and offline participant observation can provide in terms of understanding family transnational networks. Going beyond an ego-based narrative approach in interviews, digital family ethnography shows how social network analysis and reflexivity can bring depth to a study on family by including the researcher’s position vis-à-vis the research participants. The second half of the article discusses challenges in using these combined online and offline methods and how these challenges might be mitigated in future studies. In particular, the article look at problems faced with interviews, multimedia usage, and social media analysis related to the researcher’s background and in working with different age groups. In the transnational family context, social media and electronic communication are critical parts of contemporary ethnographic methodologies, and the discussion thus centres on including online personhood in the research. The study concludes that although digital family ethnography methodologies have limitations, they can be used to account for the transforming relationships that make up family mobility.","[0.020780163, 0.0, 0.00148576146, 0.0133156091, 0.00275405362, 0.073151126, 0.0188847752, 0.0571394367, 0.0391938855, 8.25071785e-05, 0.0593730634, 0.0167906007]",education,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 6.14302057e-06

Digital platforms are a promising way to support physical activity levels and may have provided an alternative for people to maintain their activity while at home. Objective: This study aimed to examine associations between the use of digital platforms and adherence to the physical activity guidelines among Australian adults and adolescents during the COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions in April and May 2020. Methods: A national online survey was distributed in May 2020. Participants included 1188 adults (mean age 37.4 years, SD15.1; 980/1188, 82.5% female) and 963 adolescents (mean age 16.2 years, SD 1.2; 685/963, 71.1% female). Participants reported demographic characteristics, use of digital platforms for physical activity over the previous month, and adherence to moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and muscle-strengthening exercise (MSE) guidelines. Multilevel logistic regression models examined differences in guideline adherence between those who used digital platforms (ie, users) to support their physical activity compared to those who did not (ie, nonusers). Results: Digital platforms include streaming services for exercise (eg, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook); subscriber fitness programs, via an app or online (eg, Centr and MyFitnessPal); facilitated online live or recorded classes, via platforms such as Zoom (eg, dance, sport training, and fitness class); sport- or activity-specific apps designed by sporting organizations for participants to keep up their skills (eg, TeamBuildr); active electronic games (eg, Xbox Kinect); and/or online or digital training or racing platforms (eg, Zwift, FullGaz, and Rouvy). Overall, 39.5% (469/1188) of adults and 26.5% (255/963) of adolescents reported using digital platforms for physical activity. Among adults, MVPA (odds ratio [OR] 2.0, 95% CI 1.5-2.7), MSE (OR 3.3, 95%CI 2.5-4.5), and combined (OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.0-3.8) guideline adherence were higher among digital platform users relative to nonusers. Adolescents’ MVPA (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.3), MSE (OR 3.1, 95% CI 2.1-4.4), and combined (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.1-9.0)guideline adherence were also higher among users of digital platforms relative to nonusers. Conclusions: Digital platform users were more likely than nonusers to meet MVPA and MSE guidelines during the COVID-19stay-at-home restrictions in April and May 2020. Digital platforms may play a critical role in helping to support physical activity engagement when access to facilities or opportunities for physical activity outside the home are restricted.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.02926156, 0.00422765, 0.0, 0.10955688, 0.1365801, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04120595]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 9.99999000e-01 6.21636194e-06 9.99999000e-01

However, little is known about the importance of interest changes, relative to stable interest levels, for predicting career outcomes. This study assessed the long-term predictive power of adolescent interest levels and interest growth for five career outcomes: degree attainment, occupational prestige, income, career- and job-satisfaction. The study used two 12- year longitudinal samples (N1 = 485; N2 = 1,290) with vocational interests measured across multiple waves from late adolescence to young adulthood. Results from both samples converged on three key findings. First, adolescents who showed better interest fit with their eventual vocation were more satisfied with their jobs over a decade later. Second, adolescent interests predicted objective career outcomes (i.e., degree attainment, occupational prestige, and income), revealing that early interests shaped educational and career choices. Third, interest changes were typically not associated with career outcomes, indicating that adolescent interest levels played a larger role. Together, these findings highlight the critical importance of childhood and adolescent interest development for guiding career trajectories and outcomes. We discuss implications for interest development theories, educational policies, and applied interventions.","[0.02925218, 0.0, 0.00580179, 0.00060557, 0.00531396, 0.01946283, 0.06944324, 0.03363507, 0.00305297, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",health_medicine,"[1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06 1.00000000e-06

The whey did nothing for him. Not surprising considering that two years later he died of a cancer from which he was in all likelihood already suffering. A family from Hamburg stayed in the room directly above him, a Mr. Mai, his wife, and their young daughter. Andersen kept company with them, among other guests in the spa, and on Thursday, May 29, he records in his diary: The weather doesn’t look promising today either. I slept with many interruptions, but slept nonetheless. My ringworm itches constantly and I have many small liver spots on my legs, what does that mean? A letter from Mrs. Melchior and from Simon Henriques. A visit from Mr. Mai, who maintained that the story about ""What the Old Man Does"" was taken from Grimm. I told him it was a Danish folktale and that Grimm had never composed a fairy tale, he was only a collector… I am not in a good mood. ""What the Old Man Does Is Always Right"" appeared in 1861 in the second series of Andersen’s New Fairy Tales and Stories. By this time, Andersen was easily Scandinavia’s most famous author, internationally acclaimed for his fairy tales that had already been translated many times into a number of languages.
