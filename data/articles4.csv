Challenges in combatting female genital mutilation: narratives of black Sub-Saharan African (BSSA) women in the English west Midlands region,"['Mathew Nyashanu', 'Maureen Mguni']","Purpose It is believed that more than 120 million women have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM) and more than 2 million young girls are at risk of undergoing FGM. FGM is practiced in different parts of the world. With globalisation and the increased movement of people across the globe, FGM is now a global problem. While ending FGM remains a priority, the approaches and strategies being used have generated contested views across the social divide. The purpose of this study is to explore the challenges in combatting FGM as experienced by Black Sub-Saharan African (BSSA) women in Diaspora. Design/methodology/approach This qualitative study used a phenomenological approach. Narratives were collected from 40 BSSA women from 20 Sub-Saharan African countries living in the English West Midlands region. A thematic approach underpinned by the four phases of data analysis in the Silences Framework were used to analyse the data. Findings The research study found that stigmatisation of survivors, utilisation of graphic images in FGM awareness, exclusion of practising communities’ gatekeepers in FGM interventions, conflation of religion and FGM practice and obsession with securing a conviction were obstacles in combating FGM. Diaspora community-driven studies exploring FGM and contested notions in addressing it from women perspectives are scarce. Originality/value This study pulls together the experiences of BSSA women and their perspectives on contested notions in combating FGM in the UK. The debate asserts the growing need to consider gender sensitive radical interventions, which involves educating perpetrators and gatekeepers among FGM practising communities.",Article,1 , International Journal of Human Rights in Healthcare,5d ago,0,"

Beyond Disciplines: Spoken Word as Participatory Arts-based Research,['Helen Johnson'],"For many, the arts and sciences stand at opposite ends of an unbridgeable divide: the sciences, rigid, objective, systematic and authoritative; the arts, fluid, subjective, dynamic and capricious. Yet, there is a long history of productive dialogue and interconnection between these fields. Arts-based research represents a particularly fertile form of arts/science interaction. This paper interweaves poetry, theoretical discussion and empirical research to make the case for spoken word poetry as an arts-based method of inquiry that can provide a radically different way of doing, being and collaborating in and through research. With reference to the innovative method of ‘collaborative poetics’ and to the work of youth slam/spoken word educators, I argue that social scientists and spoken word practitioners can learn much from one another’s tools, techniques and ways of thinking, creating new forms of knowledge, redefining the audience/author relationship, and facilitating a ‘critical resilience’ which enables both individual fortitude in the face of adversity and a means through which to challenge the conditions that give rise to this adversity. The paper thus considers how spoken word as participatory poetic inquiry enables participants, researchers and poets to address the critical complexities and challenges of contemporary life.",Article,1 , International Review of Qualitative Research,Dec 13,0,"

"There’s An App For That: Context, Assumptions, Possibilities And Potential Pitfalls In The Use Of Digital Technologies To Address Refugee Mental Health","['Ruth Goodman', 'Linda Kirsten Tip', 'Kate Cavanagh']","The number of refugees is increasing (UNHCR, 2019). The experiences of refugees are linked to impaired mental health yet, this population faces barriers to accessing mental health support (Shannon et al., 2016). Digital mental health interventions are increasingly recognised as an avenue for overcoming these barriers (WHO, 2017). The present paper begins by introducing the area of digital approaches to mental health and developments in this area targeted at refugee populations specifically. We then take a step back to look at the wider picture of refugee mental health and technology. Drawing on Toyama’s Law of Amplification (2011; 2015) - that successful technical interventions amplify the intent and the capacity of the people involved - we discuss the importance of context, exploring the assumptions, possibilities and potential pitfalls in the use of digital technologies for addressing refugee mental health. We conclude that by collaborating with refugee populations, placing them at the centre of the design process for digital mental health interventions, we stand the greatest chance of creating the most useful tools.",Article,0 , Journal of Refugee Studies,Nov 30,0,"

‘You can’t have a good integration when you don’t have a good communication’: English-language Learning Among Resettled Refugees in England,"['Linda Morrice', 'Linda Kirsten Tip', 'Michael Collyer', 'Rupert Brown']","The research presented here is based on a large-scale, multi-methods study of refugees who have been resettled to the United Kingdom. We analyse quantitative data on language proficiency four or more years after resettlement to identify the key characteristics of those who are most likely to have low language proficiency and to be at risk of long-term dependency and exclusion. Qualitative interviews on experiences of language learning suggest that English-language policy and provision serve to exacerbate and compound the risk of social exclusion, rather than ameliorate the risk. Our findings draw attention to the lack of recognition and understanding of the diversity of resettled refugees and their differential capacities, needs and opportunities for learning. They also highlight the conflict between the policy goal of rapid entry into the labour market and the goal of language learning. These findings have clear implications for integration strategies and policy.",Article,9 , Journal of Refugee Studies,,0,"

Mohajir militancy in Pakistan: Violence and transformation in the Karachi conflict,['Nichola Khan'],"Synthesizing political, anthropological and psychological perspectives, this book addresses the everyday causes and appeal of long-term involvement in extreme political violence in urban Pakistan. Taking Pakistan's ethno nationalist Mohajir party, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) as a case study, it explores how certain men from the ethnic community of Mohajirs are recruited to the roles and statuses of political killers, and sustain violence as a primary social identity and lifestyle over a period of some years. By drawing on detailed fieldwork in areas involved in the Karachi conflict, the author contributes to understandings of violence, tracing the development of violent aspects of Mohajir nationalism via an exploration of political and cultural contexts of Pakistan's history, and highlighting the repetitive homology of the conflict with the earlier violence of Partition. Through a local comparison of ethnic and religious militancy she also updates the current situation of social and cultural change in Karachi, which is dominantly framed in terms of Islamist radicalization and modernization. In her examination, governance and civil society issues are integrated with the political and psychological dimensions of mobilization processes and violence at micro-, meso- and macro- levels. This book injects a critical and innovative voice into the ongoing debates about the nature and meaning of radicalization and violence, as well as the specific implications it has for similar, contemporary conflicts in Pakistan and the developing world.",Article,,,Oct 25,0,"

Three-sided football: DIY football and social transformationalism,['Benjin Pollock'],"Devised as an illustrative example of ‘triolectics’, Danish artist and philosopher Asger Jorn first conceived of three-sided football (3SF) in 1962 as a way to radically transform the world. However, 3SF remained a purely abstracted philosophical concept until 1994 when a group of anarchists, architects and artists decided to play the game for the first time. Since these early experiments, 3SF has been played and developed across the globe, from anti-racist football festivals in Germany, contemporary art installations in France, through to youth outreach programs in Colombia. Far beyond its emergent context, the game continues to resonate for a myriad of social actors in search of bottom-up ways to enact transformational change in contemporary culture. Drawing from forty-four semi-structured interviews with players, coaches, curators and activists, this paper provides the first ethnography into 3SF and privileges much needed perspectives into how ‘DIY Football’ initiatives are actively redefining individual and collective relationships to sport and politics in informal volunteer settings. Utilising the work of Bourdieu as a useful conceptual heuristic, it details how participants reflect upon, and negotiate, the challenges of reaching beyond the ‘doxic logics’ of binary competitive team sport. Moreover, how the democratic ‘desportised’ spaces of 3SF transcend quotidian sporting contexts and offer distinct forms of political renewal, social inclusion and practical education. This study further contends that the horizontalist non-hierarchical nature of the game develops critical consciousness and community leadership for those involved in the play.",Article,1 , Sport Education and Society,Oct 23,0,"

Facilitating an evolving service user involvement group for people with dementia: what can we learn?,"['Jocelyne Kenny', 'Ian Asquith', 'Reinhard Guss[...]', 'Chris Norris']","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how service user involvement for people living with a diagnosis of dementia can contribute to innovate ways of training and educating a skilled healthcare workforce. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a case study approach, including interviews observations and reflections from facilitators and members of a service user group for people living with dementia in a recovery-based older adult service in East Kent, UK. In total, 11 people were involved in this study: five people are living with a diagnosis of dementia, two are clinical psychologists, two are trainee clinical psychologists and two are placement year psychology undergraduates. Findings – The paper shows how service user involvement groups can enable people with dementia to train a wide range of healthcare professionals in different areas, from the perspective of people living with dementia and healthcare professionals. It also reflects on the challenges that can arise through working with patients in a more collegiate way. Originality/value – This paper demonstrates that people with dementia can be involved in the training of healthcare professionals in innovative ways. It therefore suggests new ways of working with people with dementia to develop staff skills.",Article,6 , Journal of Mental Health Training,Oct 21,0,"

CO-CONSTRUCTED TRANSNATIONAL LEARNING IN POSTGRADUATE RESEARCH SUPERVISION: EXPLORING ISSUES OF POWER AND TRUST,"['Rachel Martin', 'Mark Price']","This paper considers the challenges and affordances relating to shifts in supervisory encounters arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, within a transnational postgraduate student-tutor supervisory relationship. It explores particularly the co-constructional nature of transnational learning, reflecting on issues of power and trust, from masters to doctoral research in education practice. Rachel and Mark worked together in a student-supervisor relationship, firstly on the MA Education and then on the Doctorate in Education (EdD) programmes, jointly offered by the Mauritius Institute of Education and the University of Brighton, UK. Rachel's research considers narrative and autoethnographic inquiry into educational professionalism, agency and becoming and parallels Mark's own research interest and experience. Our reflections were developed through a series of email exchanges and online discussions, theorised through meta-reflection and analysis. Informed by postcolonial perspectives, the paper notes that the complexity and inequalities of power distribution in such a transnational supervisory relationship are likely to be compounded through shifts to online only encounters. A call for a more rigorous exploration into this aspect of postgraduate research supervision is made, particularly in the context of international and transnational provision.",Article,,,Oct 21,0,"

Methodologically materialising hate: Incorporating participatory design methods within qualitative research on crime and victimisation,"['Cally Gatehouse', 'James Pickles']","The use of ‘design’ within qualitative research on crime and victimisation, and within the social disciplines more generally, has seen very little commentary or discussion. ‘Design’ is referred to throughout as the professional and scholarly practice rather than the ‘research design’, that is, the practical plan for the methods used to generate data. Design in this former sense has historically drawn on both arts and engineering to give form to garments, products and visual communication. This article presents a case study, followed by a reflective discussion, of a research project in which research through design methods were used to construct two focus groups involving lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people and police liaison officers as part of a hate crime project. Participants were asked to design reporting devices that would respond to hateful behaviour. Through the design process, participants materialised their own experiences of hate and embodied emotional responses to those experiences. The authors argue that there are methodological, ideological and practical benefits for incorporating research through design methods within qualitative research on crime and victimisation. Design offers a way of critically and creatively reimagining how research methods are understood and utilised, challenging how criminological methodologies traditionally operate.",Article,1 , Methodological Innovations Online,Oct 8,1,"

Reforming Prohibition and Preventing Harm - Dissertation,['Liam de Groot'],"This Dissertation delves into the social and political attitudes surrounding psychoactive substances and how it has dictated 'drug' policy within the western sphere over the last century. Within, I hope to present the lack of understanding held by our current legal system towards psychoactive substances and how the health and freedoms of individuals are at jeopardy under prohibitions rule. Whilst a pilot for future research, the purpose of this Dissertation is to bring forward the mounting evidence in favour of full legalisation of psychoactive substances. Full legalisation can seem extreme in many disciplines but from a harm reductionist perspective, as well as a critical criminological one, it is the most progressive. Done with the right guidance, care and educated expert input we can understand everyone's subjective reasons for medicating; be it self-medicating in the form of recreational use or access to indispensable medicines for medicinal use. In doing so, we can aim to increase the health and freedom of humankind and reduce the criminalisation of otherwise law abiding citizens.",Research,,,Oct 8,0,"

"COVID-19 lockdown and mental health: Exploring triggers of mental health distress among women in the Copperbelt province, Zambia","['Mathew Nyashanu', 'Thamary Karonga', 'Gemma North[...]', 'Wendy Nyashanu']","More than 60,000 deaths from COVID-19 had been confirmed as of the 1st of August 2020. Concerns about physical and psychological wellbeing had increased across the world with women disproportionately being affected. This research was set to explore the triggers of mental health distress among women during COVID-19 lockdown. The research study utilized a qualitative descriptive approach. Forty (N = 40) women were recruited to take part in the research study. A one to one semi structured interview schedule was used to collect data. NVivo Version 11, QSR International Pty was utilized to organize data for analysis. Content analysis was used to identify, describe, and make inferences about the qualitative data generated. Findings from new interviews were compared for consensus and disagreement. Categories were then collapsed and analyzed into clusters from which concepts and themes were developed. The research study found that the triggers for mental health distress among the research participants included domestic violence, loss of employment, stress of managing children indoors, fear of COVID-19 infection, loneliness and poor access to health services. There is need to consider radical sensitive approaches in preventing triggers of mental health distress among women.",Article,1 , International Journal of Mental Health,,0,"

‘There Is no Home Office Definition of Knife Crime’,"['Elaine Williams', 'Peter Squires']","Knife violence has become a topic of great urgency in British society, politics and culture. Hardly a day goes by without further news of brutal stabbings and tragic violence. Yet despite the current preoccupation with ‘knife crime’, stretching back some two decades, a peak in knife violence around 2007, and a resurgence in the problem ten years later, with relatively few exceptions, there has been surprisingly little detailed criminological attention given to it. Although the problem is treated as a matter of fact, a largely self-explanatory label, many commentators have repeatedly acknowledged the difficulty in establishing a consistent, workable and evidence-based definition of ‘knife crime’. What we call ‘knife crime’ consists of a range of different offences and, as our timeline shows, a ‘knife enabled’ code first entered police crime recording in 2001 but it was only in 2011 that year on year comparable knife crime data became available. Subsequently, the inclusion of ‘aggravated’ knife possession offences in the knife crime figures (themselves subject to police activity rates), has further complicated attempts to clarify ‘knife crime’ trends. Yet fears and concerns about knife crime have always been driven by more than just the numbers, such as: the state of youth, urban safety, ‘dangerous others’, even though more than half of contemporary knife violence is inflicted by adults and much of it occurs in more ‘domestic’ contexts. In this chapter we examine both the scale and nature of contemporary knife-enabled violence, and ask to what extent ‘knife crime’ can be defined and understood as a distinct category of offending. In recognising the contradictions and challenges here we begin to outline a framework for a new understanding of knife crime, i

The ‘Knife Crime Industry’: Knife Fetish and the Commodification of Violence Prevention,"['Elaine Williams', 'Peter Squires']","Knife crime became a priority issue in criminal justice practice and youth policy from 2009 onwards and directed funding supported an increasing amount of targeted knife crime prevention work and organisations dedicated to knife crime intervention. Since then, there has been a great deal of innovation in the sector and it is now possible to find companies providing anti-knife crime posters, t-shirts, stickers, magnets, educational packs, assemblies, teaching resources, knife deposit boxes and much more. Sometimes these are sponsored or associated with particularly fashionable market brands, celebrities or sports stars. The scale of services and products marketed through this crime label accumulate to what we define, following critiques developed around ‘gang interventions’ as a ‘knife crime industry’, with a cross-sector network of influential professionals who benefit from an individualistic and fetishised commodification of the label. Analysing online discourse within this industry, this chapter considers how the meaning of knife crime is constituted and constitutive of this market and profoundly self-fulfilling. We explore the implications of these developments in our broader response to child-on-child violence.",Chapter,,,,0,"

"A Prelude to ‘Knife Crime’: Gangs, Weapons and the ‘Macpherson Effect’","['Elaine Williams', 'Peter Squires']","Drawing upon the critical conjunctural analysis in Policing the Crisis (Hall et al., Policing the crisis: Mugging, the state, and law and order, Macmillan, 1978) this chapter considers the context in which a distinct mobilisation towards ‘knife crime’ (following ‘mugging’ as the new ‘black crime’) occurred, before the label was publicly defined. Contextualising this moment within the politics of a New Labour government from 1997, we consider how the contradictions of an authoritarian social democracy re-articulated the law and order society through a focus on ‘youth crime’ and anti-social behaviour. The publication of the Macpherson report and the official recognition of institutional racism within the Metropolitan Police is a significant cultural moment—the ‘Macpherson effect’—that characterises this period. Existing racialised discourses of ‘gun culture’ and ‘gang culture’ already provided justifications for robust and proactive policing strategies at the turn of the twenty-first century, but the post-Macpherson mobilisation towards ‘knife crime’ (anticipated in the 1997 Knives Act) is a particular development that is often overlooked. The introduction of the ‘knife enabled’ crime recording feature code in 2001 fundamentally changed the way crimes were categorised and reported, culminating in the problematic public definition of ‘knife crime’ as we understand it today. The interaction of events that lead to this moment will be analysed here to establish, again drawing upon Policing the Crisis, a pre-history of the label and its constitution.",Chapter,,,,0,"

A Joined-Up Approach to Sustainable Violence Prevention?,"['Elaine Williams', 'Peter Squires']","With ‘knife crime’ returning to the headlines from 2015 onwards the limitations of existing enforcement-led interventions of recent years became profoundly exposed. More than this, the impact of proactive policing upon youth and communities, especially BAME communities, with periodic roll-outs of stop and search policy, appeared to further alienate many, diminishing trust and confidence, and convincing many young people that knife carrying could offer a degree of protection. In response, especially following the much heralded success of the Strathclyde Community Initiative to Reduce Violence (CIRV) and Boston’s successful gang strategy ‘Operation Ceasefire’ in the USA, a range of international commentators have begun urging the adoption of more ‘joined up’ ‘public health’ approaches to violence. Such strategies have combined with recent WHO advocacy favouring public health, ecological or evidence-led and ‘epidemiological’, models of violence prevention, seeking to rebalance the strategies aimed at addressing knife-involved violence. But a public health violence strategy involves much more than just giving doctors and clinicians the lead, and in the chapter we raise some of the issues. Nevertheless the optimism and popularity of ‘public health’ in violence reduction has entailed a significant shift in knife crime discourse, although it has not been plain sailing—despite much talk, there is little apparent agreement on what a sustainable violence reduction strategy might actually look like as well as questions about the willingness of government—especially in austerity—to adequately fund it. The issue of mandatory A&E reporting of weapon assault injuries to the police has also divided opinion.",Chapter,,,Oct 2,0,"

A Moral Panic: The ‘War on Knife Crime’,"['Elaine Williams', 'Peter Squires']","The moral panic concerning young people and knives reached a peak in 2007 and 2008 as news media reported a spike in child knife homicides. The culmination of public pressure and politicisation set the scene for a significant expansion of police powers and related enforcement activity, a renewed commitment to stop and search, a major roll-out of Tasers to front-line police, new legislation, new offences, enhanced sentencing, and new criminal orders. The persistent criminalisation and ‘othering’ of Black youth during this moment very much mirrors the response to ‘mugging’ in the 1970s; a politics of law and order used to re-establish political authority in the midst of economic crisis. This chapter considers how the uncertainties following the global banking crisis in the 2000s, and the contrived politics of austerity which followed, established the foundations for a more authoritarian and disciplinary public policy regime. Here we situate the political focus on ‘knife crime’ in this moment as one amongst a number of important political shifts during a temporary rupture in the maintenance of political authority. This chapter follows the ‘knife crime’ chronology and narrative up to the present, including its return to the headlines around 2015, finally drawing attention to the interaction between the extension of police powers and the political uncertainty during and after Britain’s Brexit referendum and the Covid ‘lockdowns’ which followed.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Peer support groups for parent-carers of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: the importance of solidarity as care,"['Orly Klein', 'Carl Walker', 'Kim Aumann[...]', 'Jenny Terry']","Parent-carers of children with complex needs often lead lives impacted by challenging constellations of disadvantage and can become enmeshed in complex and contradictory tapestries of care structures and relations. Against a backdrop of financial austerity and under-resourced or exclusionary service practices, peer support groups may become increasingly important and confer valuable benefits not available elsewhere. This article focuses on one such group developed for parent-carers of children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and reports on semi-structured interviews with 13 parent-carers. Drawing upon Pols’ empirical ethics of care, we nuance and detail the care that emerged in these settings, highlighting the material and relational practices that developed. We conclude that peer support groups can offer new and vital possibilities, re-situating participants from individualised positions of burden, isolation and social exclusion to confident, positive, active connectedness, by means of an affective and effective relational process we call ‘solidarity-as-care’.",Article,9 , Disability & Society,Sep 13,0,"

Building Spaces for Controversial Public Engagement – Exploring and Challenging Democratic Deficits in NHS Marketization,"['Carl Walker', 'Kepa Artaraz', 'Mary Darking[...]', 'Anna Zoli']","The Brighton Citizen's Health Services Survey (BCHSS) was developed to explore and potentially challenge how knowledge is used and by whom in the production of local health commissioning institutions and relations. Through the creation of an ‘animating set of questions’, it sought to open up spaces through which to make visible some of the ways of knowing and valuing the NHS and health services that had been minimised through the commensuration practices of post-2012 public engagement. In this way there was a clear agenda to facilitate a form of knowledge democratisation which opened up and validated different 'health publics’, in order to explore and broaden participative engagement opportunities. The paper provides an account of the project. It considers the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of this example of ‘evidence-based activism’, reflects on the impact of the project on local commissioning and considers the range of controversies that arose as a result of the work. It explores the way that research straddling the boundary between academic inquiry and political activism speaks to the many issues that are prevalent in the changing HE sector as well as NHS privatisation, health commissioning and public sector cuts.",Article,8 , Journal of Social and Political Psychology,,0,"

Significant legislated changes to the National Health System (NHS) across England have increased marketisation in healthcare provision, yet little research has explored the psychological dimensions of this shifting context and its community impact. Taking a community psychological perspective to social policy, we aimed to understand lay citizens' lived experience of changes in healthcare commissioning and provision. Thematic analysis of 379 free‐text responses yielded two thematic clusters. Cluster 1 describes the lived experience of citizens considering reforms to the NHS, depicting grief, mortality and fear in uncertainty. Cluster 2 explores where these affective responses may derive from by detailing conceptualisations of the NHS in the lived experience, describing how the NHS was experienced as a complex and embodied phenomenological object. Findings suggest people relate affectively to local commissioning practices, feeling a sense of loss when facing the degradation of ‘their’ NHS. We argue that an affective relational perspective centres important questions of silencing, voice‐giving, meaningful engagement and ways of knowing that in turn impact the landscape of community health.",Article,0 , Journal of Community & Applied Social Psychology,,0,"

Deliberation on Childhood Vaccination in Canada: Public Input on Ethical Trade-Offs in Vaccination Policy,"[""Kieran C O'Doherty"", 'Sara E Crann', 'Lucie Marisa Bucci[...]', 'Don Willison']","Background Policy decisions about childhood vaccination require consideration of multiple, sometimes conflicting, public health and ethical imperatives. Examples of these decisions are whether vaccination should be mandatory and, if so, whether to allow for non-medical exemptions. In this article we argue that these policy decisions go beyond typical public health mandates and therefore require democratic input. Methods We report on the design, implementation, and results of a deliberative public forum convened over four days in Ontario, Canada, on the topic of childhood vaccination. Results 25 participants completed all four days of deliberation and collectively developed 20 policy recommendations on issues relating to mandatory vaccinations and exemptions, communication about vaccines and vaccination, and AEFI (adverse events following immunization) compensation and reporting. Notable recommendations include unanimous support for mandatory childhood vaccination in Ontario, the need for broad educational communication about vaccination, and the development of a no-fault compensation scheme for AEFIs. There was persistent disagreement among deliberants about the form of exemptions from vaccination (conscience, religious beliefs) that should be permissible, as well as appropriate consequences if parents do not vaccinate their children. Conclusions We conclude that conducting deliberative democratic processes on topics that are polarizing and controversial is viable and should be further developed and implemented to support democratically legitimate and trustworthy policy about childhood vaccination.",Article,1 , AJOB Empirical Bioethics,Aug 12,1,"

However, there is currently no research exploring the impact of sleepiness on vicariously learned fear responses.

Experiment 2 (N = 42) and Experiment 3 (N = 46) used an established vicarious learning paradigm to demonstrate that trait sleepiness facilitated vicariously acquired avoidance preferences for animals paired with fearful faces (fear-paired animals), whereas state sleepiness facilitated children’s fear cognitions and attentional bias toward fear-paired animals. This study is the first to demonstrate the role of state and trait sleepiness in moderating vicarious fear learning in children.",Article,1 , Journal of Experimental Child Psychology,Aug 1,0,"

Gender: In World Perspective 4 th Edition by Raewyn Connell – Book Review by James Pickles,['James Pickles'],"The fourth edition of Gender: In World Perspective is a concise volume in the Short Introductions’ series, and one that many in the field of gender studies will find compliments their library shelf. Comprised of eight chapters, this introductory text explores the historic development and contemporary thinking relating to gender and its relational components in different contexts across the globe. Whilst modelling the same layout as the third edition, this fourth edition provides new case studies to demonstrate everyday manifestations of gender and revises the analytical treatment of politics, environmental issues, and embodiment to bring all chapters up to date. This edition renews its efforts to be as diverse as possible, drawing on often overlooked gender research and theory from outside of Western Europe, to places such as Finland, Chile, Australia, South Africa, Indonesia, and Japan. Although touting itself as an introduction to academic perspectives on gender, this book is very comprehensive in its scope and covers the social, economic, political, relational, and global dimensions of gender theories. Due to the level of comprehension over such a short book it may be convoluted for lay audiences or those who are new to philosophies and social theories of gender. Indeed, this is no ‘easy-read’ overview of gender scholarship. Personally, I would recommend this to undergraduate students in their final years of university or postgraduate students who wish to specialise in gender research over those who are new to gender theory.

Mothering Bodies in Unloving Institutions,"['Louise Phillips', 'Helen Johnson', 'Sarah Misra', 'Agli Zavros-Orr']","Four mothers in academia collaboratively story their lived encounters, bringing differing identities, circumstances and experiences of collective exhaustion. They do this by creatively writing lived experiences, sharing these with each other, holding and feeling these lived encounters over time then creatively responding back with gifted crafted words and imagery. Reflection on these gifts and how they bring new insight to lived experiences create collated multi-vocal biographies. Through their collective arts-based poetic and visual inquiry, they see reflections and diffractions in each other’s lived stories that metaphorically provoke understandings of the pain swept into the unforgiving corners of cold, unloving universities. This work is creative resistance: to write from the body gives pearls of pleasure and joy in unloving institutions.",Chapter,,,Jun 11,0,"

Exploring the Lived Experience of People with Dementia Through Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis,['Helen Johnson'],"Dementia is arguably one of the biggest challenges facing society today, impacting millions of people worldwide. Nonetheless, there is only a relatively small body of research exploring what it is like to live with dementia from the perspectives of people who have this condition. This is partly because of the (implicit or explicit) belief that people with dementia lack insight into their condition and cannot talk about their experiences clearly. In this article, I argue that such beliefs are typically both erroneous and unhelpful, and that there is great value in seeking to illuminate the lived experiences of people with dementia. I present an interpretative phenomenological analysis of data from semi-structured interviews with six participants who had moderate dementia. I elicit five themes from this analytic process, and discuss the three most prominent here: Awareness and understanding of dementia, clarity and confusion, and social support and relationships. I mobilise these themes to narrate the lived experiences of people with dementia, demonstrating their awareness both of the difficulties presented by dementia and of the negative perceptions of others.",Article,6 , Qualitative Report,,0,"

Professional 'imperialism' and resistance: Social Work in the Filippines,"['Jem Price', 'Kepa Artaraz']","The sociology of professions has traditionally attempted to increase our understanding of categorisations of different occupations by reference to taxonomic hierarchies, as well as the identification and exploration of characteristics that warrant 'professional status'. In may cases, this explorations take the forms of historical accounts of professional activity. Rarely, however, has the literature on professions explored processes of professionalization in devoliping, post-colonial contexts. This article contributes to this body of literature in the study of professions in a number of ways. Firstly, it 'maps' the growth of social work in the Filippines, placing this account within a broader discussions of social work as an internationality activity (Harrison & Melville, 2010; Lyons, 2006) and identifying some of the key forms and features of social work in the Filippines. Consideration is given to the degree of professionalisation of social work within the country by exploring professional organisation, regulation and education. In doing this, the article offers a critical overview of the nature and preoccupations of social work in the Filippines and celebrates the invaluable contributions it makes to the country and its people. The article argue that the forms social work takes and the settings in wich it happens reflect both contemporay societal and environmental factors as well as the global development of social work. In this sense, the article considers the impact of Roman Catholicism as well as the orientation of social work in relation to some enduring tensions and debates around the profession's purpose and potential. Key to the professional forms that social work takes in the Filippines is the contribution of 'indigenous' social work know

Supporting LGBT+ People Experiencing Hate: Perspectives from LGBT+ Youth and Community Workers,['James Pickles'],"Based on data taken from lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT+) youth and community workers, this article highlights the occupational stressors experienced by LGBT+ professionals who provide emotional support to service users and theorises the potential for vicarious victimisation to occur as a result. Research suggests that the emotional harms of ‘hate’ can indirectly victimise those with a shared identity as the primary victim, through emotional contagion. However, little research has been carried out on those who support victims of hate. I theorise that vicarious victimisation may occur where an individual, who shares the primary victim’s identity, takes on their experiences through a therapeutic relationship as a negative consequence of the emotional labour performed.",Article,1 , Sociological Research Online,Jun 2,1,"

Notes from a field: A qualitative exploration of human-animal relations in a volunteer shepherding project,"['Matthew Adams', 'James Ormrod', 'Sarah Smith']","There is a burgeoning interest in human–animal relations across the social sciences and humanities, accompanied by an acceptance that nonhuman animals are active participants in countless social relations, worthy of serious and considered empirical exploration. This article, the first of its kind as far as the authors are aware, reports on an ongoing qualitative exploration of an example of contemporary human–animal interaction on the fringes of a British city: volunteer shepherding (‘lookering’). Participants are part of a conservation grazing scheme, a growing phenomenon in recent years that relies on increasingly popular volunteer programmes. The primary volunteer role in such schemes is to spend time outdoors checking the welfare of livestock. The first section of the article summarises developments in more-than-human and multispecies research methodologies, and how the challenges of exploring the non- and more-than-human in particular are being addressed. In the second section, we frame our own approach to a human–animal relation against this emerging literature and detail the practicalities of the methods we used. The third section details some of our findings specifically in terms of what was derived from the peculiarities of our method. A final discussion offers a reflection on some of the methodological and ethical implications of our research, in terms of the question of who benefits and how from this specific instance of human–animal relations, and for the development of methods attuned to human–animal and multispecies relations more generally.",Preprint,,,May 29,0,"

Digital Approaches to Music-Making for People With Dementia in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Current Practice and Recommendations,"['Becky Dowson', 'Rebecca Atkinson', 'Julie Barnes[...]', 'Justine Schneider']","Before COVID-19, dementia singing groups and choirs flourished, providing activity, cognitive stimulation, and social support for thousands of people with dementia in the UK. Interactive music provides one of the most effective psychosocial interventions for people with dementia; it can allay agitation and promote wellbeing. Since COVID-19 has halted the delivery of in-person musical activities, it is important for the welfare of people with dementia and their carers to investigate what alternatives to live music making exist, how these alternatives are delivered and how their accessibility can be expanded. This community case study examines recent practice in online music-making in response to COVID-19 restrictions for people with dementia and their supporters, focusing on a UK context. It documents current opportunities for digital music making, and assesses the barriers and facilitators to their delivery and accessibility. Online searches of video streaming sites and social media documented what music activities were available. Expert practitioners and providers collaborated on this study and supplied input about the sessions they had been delivering, the technological challenges and solutions they had found, and the responses of the participants. Recommendations for best practice were developed and refined in consultation with these collaborators. Over 50 examples of online music activities were identified. In addition to the challenges of digital inclusion and accessibility for some older people, delivering live music online has unique challenges due to audio latency and sound quality. It is necessary to adapt the session to the technology's limitations rather than expect to overcome these challenges. The recom
