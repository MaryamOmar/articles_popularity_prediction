Progress in research of measurements of biological age,"['L Chen', 'J N Fan', 'Dianjianyi Sun[...]', 'Jinghui Lyu']","Biological age (BA) can be used to measure the aging process of individuals and make up for the deficiency that chronological age cannot explain the discrepancy of health status among individuals at same chronological age. In recent years, multiple measurements of BA based on clinical or phenotypic, molecular biological, or compound indicators have emerged. In the paper, we summarize some common measurements of BA and compare their validities.",Article,1 , Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,Nov 27,0,"

Genome-wide detection and sequence conservation analysis of long non-coding RNA during hair follicle cycle of yak,"['Xiaolan Zhang', 'Qi Bao', 'Congjun Jia[...]', 'pl Yan']","Background: Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) as an important regulator has been demonstrated playing an indispensable role in the biological process of hair follicles (HFs) growth. However, their function and expression profile in the HFs cycle of yak are yet unknown. Only a few functional lncRNAs have been identified, partly due to the low sequence conservation and lack of identified conserved properties in lncRNAs. Here, lncRNA-seq was employed to detect the expression profile of lncRNAs during the HFs cycle of yak, and the sequence conservation of two datasets between yak and cashmere goat during the HFs cycle was analyzed. Results: A total of 2884 lncRNAs were identified in 5 phases (Jan., Mar., Jun., Aug., and Oct.) during the HFs cycle of yak. Then, differential expression analysis between 3 phases (Jan., Mar., and Oct.) was performed, revealing that 198 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) were obtained in the Oct.-vs-Jan. group, 280 DELs were obtained in the Jan.-vs-Mar. group, and 340 DELs were obtained in the Mar.-vs-Oct. group. Subsequently, the nearest genes of lncRNAs were searched as the potential target genes and used to explore the function of DELs by GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. Several critical pathways involved in HFs development such as Wnt signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, and signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells, were enriched. To further screen key lncRNAs influencing the HFs cycle, 24 DELs with differ degree of sequence conservation were obtained via a comparative analysis of partial DELs with previously published lncRNA-seq data of cashmere goat in the HFs cycle using NCBI BLAST-2.9.0+, and 3 DELs of them were randomly selected for further detailed a

Improving Survey Measurement of Household Finances: A Review of New Data Sources and Technologies,"['Annette Jäckle', 'Mick P. Couper', 'Alessandra Gaia', 'Carli Lessof']","This chapter reviews different process‐generated data sources and new technologies that could be used to enhance the measurement of household finances in longitudinal surveys. It examines financial aggregators, loyalty cards, credit and debit cards, credit ratings, barcode scanning, receipt scanning, and mobile apps. The chapter aims to contribute to a greater understanding of errors that may arise at different stages of the data generating mechanism (with process generated data), or data collection (with new technologies), and how resulting errors may affect data quality. This will inform research and development into methods to reduce the likelihood and impact of errors. An expanded version of the total survey error framework is proposed for evaluating these new data sources. The chapter concludes with a discussion of implications for survey practice and research needs.",Chapter,,,Apr 1,0,"

R&D Productivity and the Nexus between Product Substitutability and Innovation: Theory and Experimental Evidence,"['Christos A. Ioannou', 'Miltiadis Makris', 'Carmine Ornaghi']","The present study proposes a theoretical model that investigates how R&D productivity influences the relationship between product substitutability and R&D investment in a duopolistic market. We argue that the effects on R&D investment are more complex than the previous literature suggests. We show theoretically that, in unlevelled industries, the laggard’s R&D investment decreases with product substitutability regardless of the R&D productivity level. In sharp contrast, in levelled industries, whether R&D investment increases or decreases with product substitutability depends crucially on the level of the R&D productivity. We choose parameters and formulate testable predictions that we take to the laboratory. We find that subjects’ behavior is largely consistent with the model’s predictions.",Article,1 , Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization,,1,"

Improving Research Methods Teaching and Learning in Politics and International Relations: A ‘Reality Show’ Approach,"['Matt Ryan', 'Clare Saunders', 'Emily Rainsford', 'Emma Thompson']",Student dissatisfaction with undergraduate research methods courses in politics and international relations is common across the sector. We suggest that methods teaching suffers from an unhealthy disassociation between research in theory – which we call ‘method acting’ – and research in practice. Our critical interviews with eminent researchers expose the compromises professional researchers make when designing their research. Students appreciate these insights when combined with first-hand research opportunities. We call this approach a ‘reality show’. Our analysis based on survey data and students’ evaluations of our approach suggests that these aids can provide an effective resource to improve teaching and learning of research methods.,Article,3 , Politics,,0,"

Age-Optimal Transmission Policy with HARQ for Freshness-Critical Vehicular Status Updates in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks,"['Ying Wang', 'Shaohua Wu', 'Jian Jiao[...]', 'Qinyu Zhang']","In this paper, we investigate the freshness of the vehicular status updates in space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN), where the status updates are generated by sampling a fixed-rate dynamic Markov process and delivered to the monitor over an unreliable channel instantaneously. The age of information (AoI) is adopted to capture the timeliness of the status updates. Two Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) schemes, namely, classical HARQ scheme and incremental redundancy HARQ (IR-HARQ) scheme, are taken into consideration to combat the errors occurred in the transmission. In this setting, once an update is not decoded successfully, one should carefully decide how to schedule the updates for optimizing the AoI. Especially, differential encoding scheme is introduced in the considered system to exploit the temporal correlations of the source. By differential encoding, each update can be actual or differential, based on the differential encoding level. To minimize the long-term average age, we formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and prove that the optimal transmission policies for classical HARQ scheme and IR-HARQ scheme behave differently in threshold structures. Further, we jointly optimize the codeword length, differential encoding level and retransmission times to minimize the AoI. The performance comparison shows the advantages of IR-HARQ scheme over classical HARQ scheme from the age perspective.",Article,0 , IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,0,"

Association between perception of community environment and physical activity in residents in Suzhou,"['Y J Hua', 'Y Lu', 'L C Wang[...]', 'Lin Li']","Objective: To estimate physical activity level in residents in Suzhou and explore the association between community environment and physical activity level in local residents. Methods: Through multistage stratified random sampling, residents aged 25-64 years in Suzhou were surveyed by face-to face interview in 2017. Physical activity levels were assessed by the international physical activity questionnaire-long version (IPAQ-L). Perceptions of community environment were assessed by Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale-Abbreviated (NEWS-A). Results: Among the local residents surveyed in Suzhou,the median of weekly total physical activity level was 3 610.42 MET-min/w. The level of occupational physical activity was higher than that of transportation, household and leisure-time related physical activity levels. After controlling for socio-demographic factors, public service access was negatively associated with the overall physical activity level (OR=0.522,95%CI:0.329-0.830), land-use mix-diversity was negatively associated with the level of occupational physical activity level (OR=0.701,95%CI: 0.492-0.999), infrastructure of walk and cycle ways was positively associated with occupational physical activity level (OR=1.603,95%CI:1.004-2.559); traffic hazards were negatively associated with the transportation physical activity level (OR=0.642,95%CI: 0.416-0.990); residential building density was positively associated with leisure-time physical activity level (OR=1.001,95%CI: 1.000-1.002), and the perceptions level of community environment were positively associated with the occupational, transportation, household and overall physical activity levels (OR=1.889,95%CI: 1.176-3.033;OR=1.671,95%CI: 1.120-2.495;OR=1.775,9

Efficacy and Safety of TangWang Prescription for Type 2 Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy: A Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"['De Jin', 'Yuehong Zhang', 'Yuqing Zhang[...]', 'Xiaolin Tong']","Background: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common and severe microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus (DM), which results in blindness among adults worldwide. Presently, the efficacy of drug treatments for diabetic retinopathy (DR) is not satisfactory, thus urgently necessitating effective drug treatment measures. TangWang prescription (TWP) has been found to have retinal protection effects in previous clinical and basic research. However, there is a lack of rigorous, randomized, and controlled studies. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TWP in delaying the development of DR. Methods: This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial, consisting of 384 participants to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio in the treatment and control groups. Furthermore, the treatment and control groups will be administered the TangWang prescription and the placebo, respectively, each at a dose of one bag twice a day. The study period will last for 48 weeks. The primary outcome measure will be the changes in the degree of retinal microvascular lesions before and after treatment. The secondary outcome will be changes in the degree of hemangioma, microvascular bleeding, microvascular leakage, macular edema, and vision. All statistical tests will be two-sided, and a p < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Discussion: We hypothesize that the patients with DR will benefit from TangWang prescription, and in addition to the central random system and platform of dynamic information collection, the patients’ conditions will be monitored, and the data collected for analysis. If successful, this study will provide evidence that the TWP formulation del

Two-timescale evolution of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals: Waveform generation scheme for quasicircular orbits in Schwarzschild spacetime,"['Jeremy Miller', 'Adam Pound']","Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, in which a stellar-mass compact object spirals into a supermassive black hole in a galactic core, are expected to be key sources for LISA. Modeling these systems with sufficient accuracy for LISA science requires going to second (or postadiabatic) order in gravitational self-force theory. Here we present a practical two-timescale framework for achieving this and generating postadiabatic waveforms. The framework comprises a set of frequency-domain field equations that apply on the fast, orbital timescale, together with a set of ordinary differential equations that determine the evolution on the slow, inspiral timescale. Our analysis is restricted to the special case of quasicircular orbits around a Schwarzschild black hole, but its general structure carries over to the realistic case of generic (inclined and eccentric) orbits in Kerr spacetime. In our restricted context, we also develop a tool that will be useful in all cases: a formulation of the frequency-domain field equations using hyperboloidal slicing, which significantly improves the behavior of the sources near the boundaries. We give special attention to the slow evolution of the central black hole, examining its impact on both the two-timescale evolution and the earlier self-consistent evolution scheme.",Article,,,,0,"

Methods: Data was obtained from the Beijing MJ Health Screening Center. A total of 13 689 participants who attended health checkups at least twice during 2008-2019 and had more than three years' intervals during these two health checkups were included in the study. The frailty index comprising 28 variables was used to measure frailty status. Frailty was defined as frailty index ≥0.25, and prefrailty was defined as frailty index >0.10 and <0.25. Logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the association of socio-demographic factors and lifestyle characteristics with the worsening of frailty status, stratified by frailty status at the first health checkup. Results: The mean age at the first and last health checkups were (42.3±9.2) and (47.9±9.3) years, respectively. The mean interval during these two health checkups was (5.7±1.9) years. At the first health checkup, the prevalence of frailty and prefrailty were 2.5% and 50.3%, respectively. While at the last health checkup, the prevalence of frailty and prefrailty rose to 3.9% and 55.4%. Of all participants, 67.3% remained in the same frailty state, 21.2% worsening, and 12.5% improving. In robust participants at the first health checkup, older age, female, low education level, smoking cessation, daily smoking, being general obesity measured by BMI or central obesity measured by WHR showed an increased the risk of worsening frailty status. However, in prefrail participants at the first health checkup, older age, female, general, or central obesity presented as risk factors for worsening frailty status.

Investigation of a semi-empirical load model of natural gas explosion in vented spaces,"['Shigang Yang', 'Jiongwei Cai', 'Qin Fang[...]', 'Qi Bao']","Due to the influence of many factors, the overpressure–time history load model of vented gas explosions is difficult to describe and is not conducive to further structural design. Based on vented gas explosion test data, this paper obtains three typical overpressure-time history curves and puts forward a new semi-empirical model— double hump model that considers gas concentration and venting pressure, and gives a formula for peak pressure and overpressure–time history model. The scientificity of the model is then verified by the total impulse in the load. The model is able directly reflect the load characteristics, provide reference for calculating key parameters of a vented gas explosion and provide information on the structural response under the load. The model thereby has the potential to help reduce the impact of gas explosion disasters.",Article,,,Sep 1,0,"

The early Neolithic flint mines of Sussex and their wider environs (4000-3650 BC),['Jon Baczkowski'],"The study of Early Neolithic flint mining began in the late 19th century in Sussex with a series of seminal excavations at chalk downland sites, including Blackpatch, Church Hill, Cissbury and Harrow Hill. Over the next century further excavations and research on the Sussex mines contributed to the narrative of the Neolithic period in southern England. The Early Neolithic flint mines of Sussex remain one of the earliest forms of large-scale monument to be constructed in the British Isles and their products, mostly finely made bifacial axes, were widely distributed across the region. Numerous flint mines are also found across Northwest Europe, including extensive complexes in Belgium, France, Poland and the Netherlands, and the act of extracting flint from deep workings remains a defining element of the Neolithic. Research on the English flint mines has diminished in recent decades, with no new fieldwork carried out for over 30 years, in contrast to Continental Europe where numerous sites are still under excavation. This thesis combines archival research and reassessment of previous research with new fieldwork, radiocarbon dates and other data to question longstanding interpretations of the Sussex mines. It is proposed that flint mines were pivotal monuments to the creation, development and spread of nascent Early Neolithic practices and cultural identities from the very start of the period in southern England. The thesis develops the study of flint mining beyond the immediate mine workings and into the wider landscape. Finally, this thesis increases knowledge on the communities who extracted flint from deep beneath the ground from the start of the Neolithic, one of the most important periods in the prehistory of the British Isles.",Thesis,,,Apr 10,0,"

Determinants of SMEs’ Financial Performance: Evidence from an Emerging Economy,"['Gabriel sam Ahinful', 'Danquah Boakye', 'Nana Bempah']","Financial performance (FP) is important to every firm, especially SMEs, but FP determinants are debatable. This paper investigates determinants of FP among Ghanaian SMEs. Employing a survey data set of 238 SMEs, multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the extent to which each firm-specific characteristic and industry impact FP. The findings show that a significant relationship exists between company ownership type and FP. There is also a positive link between firm age, firm size, and FP. The industry effect is significant in the services sector. The results also show that the impact of firm-specific characteristics and industry differs across the sub-components of FP and manufacturing and service industries. The results demonstrate the relevance of the tenets of resource base view and structure- conduct-performance in explaining the SMEs' FP variations in a developing country context.

Methods: Based on the second resurvey of China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) in 2013-2014, logistic regression models were used to analyze the correlation of different types, number and duration of chronic diseases with low muscle mass, handgrip strength and muscle quality. Results: The prevalence rate of diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were 9.6%, 5.8%, 3.2% and 26.8%, respectively, and 38.8% of the participants had at least one disease, and they were more likely to have low handgrip strength and low arm muscle quality (AMQ), and the longer the chronic diseases duration, the higher the risk. The ORs (95%CIs) for low handgrip strength and low AMQ in patients with 1 chronic disease for more than 10 years was 1.64 (1.42-1.90) and 1.83 (1.60-2.10), respectively. The ORs (95%CIs) for low handgrip strength were 1.26 (1.17-1.37), 1.42 (1.23-1.64) and 2.27 (1.55-3.32) and the ORs (95%CIs) for low AMQ were 1.28 (1.18-1.38), 1.67 (1.46-1.92) and 2.41(1.69-3.45), respectively, in patients with 1, 2, ≥3 chronic diseases, the correlation showed a linear trend (P for trend <0.001).

Discriminating Power of Centrality Measures in Complex Networks,"['Qi Bao', 'Zhongzhi Zhang']","Centrality metrics are one of the most fundamental tools in social network analysis and network science, and various measures for evaluating node importance metrics have been devised. However, the crucial issue of testing the discriminating power of different centrality measures is still open. In this article, we propose to assess the discriminating power of node centrality measures by using the notion of automorphism and orbit: nodes in the same orbit have identical metric scores, while nodes in different orbits should have different centrality values. Under this assumption, we present a benchmark for the discriminating power of node centrality measures. Moreover, we propose an efficient approach to evaluate centrality measures in terms of the discriminating power, which is devoid of finding orbits. Extensive experiments on real and model networks are executed to compare seven commonly used node centrality metrics.",Article,1 , IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,,0,"

Evolution of the hinterlands of eight Chinese ports exporting to europe under the Polar Silk Road: Three hypothetical scenarios,"['Yan Peng', 'Zhenfu Li', 'Wei Duan[...]', 'Qi Bao']","In July 2017, Russia formally offered an invitation to build the Polar Silk Road (PSR) to China. Then, the White Paper of China's Arctic Policy was officially published in January 2018. It proposes the joint construction of the PSR to promote sustainable economic and social development in the Arctic region. Notably, the PSR aims to open up China's maritime trade route through the Arctic to Northwest Europe and influence the container hinterland pattern of China's coastal ports. This study assumes three scenarios to analyse and predict the evolution of the hinterlands of Chinese ports exporting to Europe under the PSR. The discrete selection model based on random utility is constructed to divide the dominant hinterland, probabilistic hinterland and major competitive hinterland of ports. The research shows that the cost and time, container throughput and risk have negative effects on a shipper's choice of port, whereas the sailing frequency has a positive effect. In general, the hinterlands of northern ports continue to expand under the PSR. Meanwhile, the hinterlands of the middle ports decrease first and then increase, and those of the southern ports contract. Overall, the northern ports are the most vulnerable to the changes of PSR attributes.",Article,1 , Ocean & Coastal Management,,0,"

Benchmark for Discriminating Power of Edge Centrality Metrics,"['Qi Bao', 'Wanyue Xu', 'Zhongzhi Zhang']","Edge centrality has found wide applications in various aspects. Many edge centrality metrics have been proposed, but the crucial issue that how good the discriminating power of a metric is, with respect to other measures, is still open. In this paper, we address the question about the benchmark of the discriminating power of edge centrality metrics. We first use the automorphism concept to define equivalent edges, based on which we introduce a benchmark for the discriminating power of edge centrality measures and develop a fast approach to compare the discriminating power of different measures. According to the benchmark, for a desirable measure, equivalent edges have identical metric scores, while inequivalent edges possess different scores. However, we show that even in a toy graph, inequivalent edges cannot be discriminated by three existing edge centrality metrics. We then present a novel edge centrality metric called forest centrality (FC). Extensive experiments on real-world networks and model networks indicate that FC has better discriminating power than three existing edge centrality metrics.",Article,1 , The Computer Journal,Sep 18,0,"

Descriptive analysis of fracture hospitalization rate in adults from 10 regions of China,"['Z W Shen', 'Wei Yuxia', 'C Q Yu[...]', 'Lin Li']","Objective: To analyze the epidemiological distributions of fracture hospitalization. Methods: The present study included participants who participated in the baseline survey of China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) and excluded participants who were lost to follow up or died before 2009, leaving a total of 506 004 participants. Negative binomial regression models were used to analyze the epidemiological distribution of any fracture and fracture at five specific body sites (upperlimb, lowerlimb, spine, pelvis and hip) from 2009 to 2016 in 10 regions. Results: During a median follow-up of (7.7±1.2) years (total person-years 3 899 814), we documented 17 118 cases of fracture hospitalizations. The crude fracture hospitalization rate was 4.39/1 000 person-years. After controlling for the increasing age of the fixed cohort, the hospitalization rates of fractures at various body sites increased from 2009 to 2016, with an annual growth rate (95%CI) of 9.1% (8.3%-9.9%) for any fracture. The fracture hospitalization rate was higher in rural than in urban areas except for hip fractures (P<0.05) and the hospitalization rate of any fracture were 5.42/1 000 and 3.24/1 000 person-years in rural and urban areas, respectively. Fracture hospitalization rate increased by age. In participants aged <50 years, men had higher fracture hospitalization rates than women except for pelvis fracture, while in those aged ≥50 years, women had higher fracture hospitalization rates than men.

Gravitational-Wave Energy Flux for Compact Binaries through Second Order in the Mass Ratio,"['Niels Warburton', 'Adam Pound', 'Barry Wardell[...]', 'Leanne Durkan']","Within the framework of self-force theory, we compute the gravitational-wave energy flux through second order in the mass ratio for compact binaries in quasicircular orbits. Our results are consistent with post-Newtonian calculations in the weak field, and they agree remarkably well with numerical-relativity simulations of comparable-mass binaries in the strong field. We also find good agreement for binaries with a spinning secondary or a slowly spinning primary. Our results are key for accurately modeling extreme-mass-ratio inspirals and will be useful in modeling intermediate-mass-ratio systems.",Article,1 , Physical Review Letters,,0,"

A Telomerase Responsive DNA-icosahedron for Precise Delivery of Platinum-nanodrug to Cisplatin-resistance Cancer,"['Yi Ma', 'Zhaohui Wang', 'Yuxuan Ma[...]', 'Yueqing Gu']","Featured with structure controllability and good biocompatibility, DNA nanostructure is becoming a promising candidate for drug delivery. Here, a telomerase‐responsive DNA‐icosahedron was designed to precisely release caged platinum‐nanodrugs into cisplatin‐resistance tumor cells for effective therapy. This DNA‐icosahedron was constructed by two pyramidal DNA cages connected with telomerase primers and telomeric repeats, while platinum‐nanodrugs were encapsulated into this DNA‐icosahedron. The presence of telomerase will elongate the primers, leading to the inner chain substitution of DNA‐icosahedron and subsequent releasing of caged nanodrugs. Results demonstrated this DNA‐icosahedron could precisely release caged nanodrugs in response to telomerase in tumor cells, exhibit enhanced anticancer efficacy to chemo‐resistance carcinoma and reduce toxicity to normal organs. We speculate this precisely designed, well controlled DNA cage can be generalized to diverse anticancer drugs.",Article,8 , Angewandte Chemie,,0,"

"Novel Fractional Wavelet Packet Transform: Theory, Implementation, and Applications","['Jun Shi', 'Xiaoping Liu', 'Wei Xiang[...]', 'Qinyu Zhang']","The fractional wavelet transform (FRWT), which generalizes the classical wavelet transform and the well-known fractional Fourier transform, has recently been demonstrated as a powerful analytical tool for signal and image processing. However, this transform suffers from a relatively poor resolution in the high fractional frequency region, which results in difficulties in discriminating signals containing close high fractional frequency components. A simple but effective method to overcome this deficiency is the fractional wavelet packet transform (FRWPT). There exist several different definitions of the FRWPT in the literature. Unfortunately, these existing definitions do not generalize well the classical results for the conventional wavelet packet transform. The objective of this paper is to obtain a novel FRWPT that preserves the properties of its conventional counterpart. We first define the novel FRWPT and then discuss its related properties. Fractional wavelet packet subspaces are also constructed. Moreover, a recursive algorithm for implementing the proposed FRWPT is presented. Finally, we discuss potential applications of the proposed FRWPT.",Article,0 , IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,,0,"

Verapamil enhances the antiproliferative effect of chemotherapeutic reagents and inhibits tumor growth of chemoresistant side population in pancreatic cancer,"['Liang Zhao', 'Y Zhao', 'Bettina Schwarz-Mörtl[...]', 'AG Bruns']","Introduction: Verapamil is an L-type calcium channel blocker and has been used in the treatment of hypertension, angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, and most recently, cluster headaches. Increasing evidence shows that Verapamil is able to enhance the cytotoxic effect of certain chemotherapies and reverse multidrug resistance by competitively inhibiting drug transport through P-glycoprotein. The side population (SP) is a small subtype of tumor cells with stem-like properties which could substantially be blocked by verapamil. In this study, we focus on the therapeutic potential of verapamil on stem-like SP cells and its positive effect as a chemotherapy promoter in pancreatic cancer. Material and methods: From the highly metastatic pancreatic cancer cell line L3.6pl a gemcitabine resistant variant (L3.6plGem) was developed and further validated by IC-50 determination. Hoechst33342 staining was used to detect the SP proportion in both sensitive and resistant L3.6pl cells. Proliferation assays, clonogenic assays, migration assays and apoptosis assays were performed in the presence of verapamil alone and combined with gemcitabine treatment. SP cells sorted from L3.6plGem were implanted orthotopically in nude mice and treated with verapamil by daily i.p injections. Results: After continuous treatment with gemcitabine, the IC50 of L3.6plGem significantly increased from 6.11ng/ml±0.93 to 119.77ng/ml±5.12 (p<1E-9). In parallel, the percentage of SP cells rose from 0.9%±0.22 to 5.38%±0.99 (p<5E-17). Verapamil treatment inhibited cell proliferation in both sensitive and resistant cells and increased chemosensitivity to gemcitabine. After 4 weeks daily therapy with verapamil, the in vivo data indicated a significant inhibition of primary tumor growth

Multidimensional entanglement transport through single-mode fiber,"['Jun Liu', 'Isaac Nape', 'Qainke Wang[...]', 'Andrew Forbes']","The global quantum network requires the distribution of entangled states over long distances, with substantial advances already demonstrated using polarization. While Hilbert spaces with higher dimensionality, e.g., spatial modes of light, allow higher information capacity per photon, such spatial mode entanglement transport requires custom multimode fiber and is limited by decoherence-induced mode coupling. Here, we circumvent this by transporting multidimensional entangled states down conventional single-mode fiber (SMF). By entangling the spin-orbit degrees of freedom of a biphoton pair, passing the polarization (spin) photon down the SMF while accessing multiple orbital angular momentum (orbital) subspaces with the other, we realize multidimensional entanglement transport. We show high-fidelity hybrid entanglement preservation down 250 m SMF across multiple 2 × 2 dimensions, confirmed by quantum state tomography, Bell violation measures, and a quantum eraser scheme. This work offers an alternative approach to spatial mode entanglement transport that facilitates deployment in legacy networks across conventional fiber.",Article,0 , Science Advances,,1,"

Synergistic ferroptosis and macrophage re-polarization using engineering exosome-mimic M1 nanovesicles for cancer metastasis suppression,"['Ping Li', 'Mengqiu Gao', 'Zijian Hu[...]', 'Yueqing Gu']","Ferroptosis has been proved effective in cancer metastasis treatment, while the lack of internal ferric aggregation and sufficient catalysis at desired sites astrict the further therapeutic applications. Herein, M1 macrophages engineered with up-regulated CCR2 expression are employed as Fe3O4 nanoparticles carrier. Modified macrophages are further extruded into exosome-mimic nanovesicles (denoted as CCR2(+)-Fe-M1-Nvs) for preferential delivery. Compared with M1-derived exosomes, CCR2(+)-Fe-M1-Nvs exhibit favorable modification and production efficiency, and can be obtained in large quantity. Moreover, correlative in vivo and in vitro measurements find that CCR2(+)-Fe-M1-Nvs are recruited in the metastatic lesion through CCR2-CCL2 axis which is analogous to mature macrophages. Delivered Fe3O4 nanoparticles and M1-related factors (e.g·H2O2) serve as catalyzer of Fenton Reaction and facilitate ferroptosis in tumor, which collectively induce macrophages re-polarization thereby provoke tumor-specific immune response. Such nano-Fenton reactor as well as M2 nano-repolarizer are proved cooperatively efficient in already formed lung metastasis mice model and shed lights on the exploration of synergistic strategies for cancer metastasis management.",Article,1 , Chemical Engineering Journal,,0,"

Principles and State of the Art of Agent-Based Migration Modelling,"['Martin Hinsch', 'Jakub Bijak']","Migration as an individual behaviour as well as a macro-level phenomenon happens as part of hugely complex social systems. Understanding migration and its consequences therefore necessitates adopting a careful analytical approach using appropriate tools, such as agent-based models. Still, any model can only be specific to the question it attempts to answer. This chapter provides a general discussion of the key tenets related to modelling complex systems, followed by a review of the current state of the art in the simulation modelling of migration. The subsequent focus of the discussion on the key principles for modelling migration processes, and the context in which they occur, allows for identifying the main knowledge gaps in the existing approaches and for providing practical advice for modellers. In this chapter, we also introduce a model of migration route formation, which is subsequently used as a running example throughout this book.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Subsequently, we present selected results of the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, enabling us to make further inference on the information gaps and areas for potential data collection. We also present model calibration for an empirically grounded version of the model, Risk and Rumours with Reality. In that way, we can evaluate to what extent the iterative modelling process has enabled a reduction in the uncertainty of the migrant route formation.

Galectin-1 induces invasion and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human gastric cancer cells via non-canonical activation of the hedgehog signaling pathway,"['Yang Chong', 'Dong Tang', 'Jun Gao[...]', 'Daorong Wang']","Galectin-1 (Gal-1) has been reported to be an independent prognostic indicator of poor survival in gastric cancer and overexpression of Gal-1 enhances the invasiveness of gastric cancer cells. However, the downstream mechanisms by which Gal-1 promotes invasion remains unclear. Moreover, the function of Gal-1 in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in gastric cancer has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we observed Gal-1 expression was upregulated and positively associated with metastasis and EMT markers in 162 human gastric cancer tissue specimens. In vitro studies showed Gal-1 induced invasion, the EMT phenotype and activated the non-canonical hedgehog (Hh) pathway in gastric cancer cell lines. Furthermore, our data revealed that Gal-1 modulated the non-canonical Hh pathway by increasing the transcription of glioma-associated oncogene-1 (Gli-1) via a Smoothened (SMO)-independent manner, and that upregulation of Gal-1 was strongly associated with gastric cancer metastasis. We conclude that Gal-1 promotes invasion and the EMT in gastric cancer cells via activation of the non-canonical Hh pathway, suggesting Gal-1 could represent a promising therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of gastric cancer metastasis.",Article,6 , Oncotarget,,1,"

"Efficacy of Perioperative Intercostal Analgesia via a Multimodal Analgesic Regimen for Chronic Post-Thoracotomy Pain During Postoperative Follow-Up: A Big-Data, Intelligence Platform-Based Analysis","['Yijin Yu', 'Lingyan Cui', 'Lu Qian[...]', 'Junran Xie']","Background: Chronic post-thoracotomy pain is still an obstacle for lung-cancer patients even after less invasive surgical procedures. It is unclear whether intercostal analgesia is as useful in the prevention of postoperative chronic pain as it is for acute pain for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of perioperative intercostal analgesia for chronic pain via a multimodal analgesic regimen for VATS during 6 months of postoperative follow-up. Methods: We identified 837 cases of VATS from August 2016 to August 2018. Patients were treated by perioperative intercostal analgesia with 0.75% ropivacaine 50 mg through the intercostal catheter every 8 hours until chest tube extubation (INA group) or conventional analgesia with preoperative 0.75% ropivacaine 50 mg at incision once (CON group). Numerical rating scale (NRS) and neuropathic pain were evaluated in 6 months of post-surgery follow-up. Postoperative adverse effects were recorded. Results: In total, there were 419 patients in INA group and 418 patients in CON group. Scores of NRS with motion was lower in INA group at 3 postoperative days (P = 0.032). Occurrence of chronic pain was 28.4% in INA group and 32.8% in CON group at 6 postoperative months, 10.6% of patients experienced increasing pain from 3 to 6 months. Occurrence of considerable neuropathic pain (ID pain score ≥ 2) was 2.1% in INA group and 3.1% in CON group at 6 postoperative months. No differences were found between the two groups.

An effective biphase system accelerates hesperidinase-catalyzed conversion of rutin to isoquercitrin,"['Jun Wang', 'An Gong', 'Cai-Feng Yang[...]', 'Fu-An Wu']","Isoquercitrin is a rare, natural ingredient with several biological activities that is a key precursor for the synthesis of enzymatically modified isoquercitrin (EMIQ). The enzymatic production of isoquercitrin from rutin catalyzed by hesperidinase is feasible; however, the bioprocess is hindered by low substrate concentration and a long reaction time. Thus, a novel biphase system consisting of [Bmim][BF4]:glycine-sodium hydroxide (pH 9) (10:90, v/v) and glyceryl triacetate (1:1, v/v) was initially established for isoquercitrin production. The biotransformation product was identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the bonding mechanism of the enzyme and substrate was inferred using circular dichroism spectra and kinetic parameters. The highest rutin conversion of 99.5% and isoquercitrin yield of 93.9% were obtained after 3 h. The reaction route is environmentally benign and mild, and the biphase system could be reused. The substrate concentration was increased 2.6-fold, the reaction time was reduced to three tenths the original time. The three-dimensional structure of hesperidinase was changed in the biphase system, which α-helix and random content were reduced and β-sheet content was increased. Thus, the developed biphase system can effectively strengthen the hesperidinase-catalyzed synthesis of isoquercitrin with high yield.",Article,5 , Scientific Reports,,1,"

Polygenic risk score in personalized screening of lung cancer: a prospective cohort study in Chinese,"['M Zhu', 'Jinghui Lyu', 'C Q Yu[...]', 'Lin Li']","Objective: To explore how to personalize lung cancer screening programs for prevention in Chinese populations based on individual genetic risk score. Methods: We constructed the lung cancer polygenic genetic risk score (PRS-19) based on the 19 previously published genetic variations, using 100 615 participants with genotyping data from the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB). Using the 5-year absolute risk of lung cancer in a population (55 years old with at least 30-pack-year history of smoking) as reference, the trend of 5-year absolute risk in different genetic risk groups was calculated in smokers and non-smokers, respectively. Distribution curves of 5-year absolute risk were also described to determine the theoretical age or smoking dose when different genetic risk groups reached the reference values. Given the overall findings, the specific start age for lung cancer screening were suggested for different genetic risk groups. Results: The 5-year absolute risk of lung cancer was 0.67% in 55-year-old smokers with 30 packs per year in the CKB. Among smokers, 5-year absolute risk of participants increased as the genetic risk increased. Hence, it was recommended that people at high genetic risk should start screening earlier. For the highest genetic risk populations (the top 1% of PRS), the start age might be changed to 50 years old. If the start age remained at 55-year-old, the smoking dose should be set lowered in high genetic risk populations. For the highest genetic risk populations, they should be included in lung cancer screening regardless of the cumulative smoking exposure. Among nonsmokers, it was also valuable to screen people with high genetic risk, considering the start age of 62 for the highest genetic risk populatio

Methods: Data of 23 615 participants from the second resurvey of the China Kadoore Biobank (CKB) was used. Fried phenotype was constructed using five phenotypes, and frailty indexes (FI) were constructed using 28 and 40 deficits, respectively. We calculated the Weighted Kappa coefficient to compare the consistency of three measures in the classification of frailty status. Cox regression was performed to analyze the association of frailty status with risk of mortality. Results: The frailty prevalence calculated by Fried phenotype, FI-28, and FI-40 were 5.4%, 7.9%, and 4.0%, respectively. The Kappa coefficients of Fried phenotype with FI-28 and FI-40 were 0.357 and 0.408, respectively. The Kappa coefficients of FI-28 and FI-40 was 0.712. During an average of (3.9±0.5) years of follow-up, 755 participants died. When Fried phenotype was used, compared with the robust participants, the prefrail and frail participants had increased risk of mortality, the multivariable-adjusted HRs were 1.60 (95%CI: 1.32-1.94) and 2.90 (95%CI: 2.25-3.73), respectively.

Nrf2 is Essential for Timely M-phase Entry of Replicating Hepatocytes during Liver Regeneration.,"['Yuhong Zou', 'Min Hu', 'Joonyong Lee[...]', 'Guoli Dai']","Transcription factor Nrf2 regulates various cellular activities including the redox balance, detoxification, metabolism, autophagy, proliferation and apoptosis. A few studies demonstrate that Nrf2 regulates hepatocyte proliferation during liver regeneration. The aim of the study was to gain insight into how Nrf2 modulates the cell cycle of replicating hepatocytes in regenerating livers. Wild-type and Nrf2-null mice were subjected to 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PH) and sacrificed at multiple time points for various analyses. Nrf2-null mice exhibited sluggish liver regrowth, although the lost liver mass was eventually restored seven days after PH. Nrf2 deficiency did not affect the number of hepatocytes entering the cell cycle, but rather caused a delay in hepatocyte mitosis. Mechanistically, the lack of Nrf2 resulted in increased mRNA and protein levels of hepatic Cyclin A2 when remaining hepatocytes were replicating in response to PH. Moreover, in regenerating livers, Nrf2 deficiency caused dysregulation of Wee1, Cdc2, and Cyclin B1 in their mRNA and protein expression, leading to decreased activity of Cdc2. Nrf2 is required for timely M phase entry of replicating hepatocytes by ensuring proper regulation of Cyclin A2 and the Wee1/Cdc2/Cyclin B1 pathway during live regeneration.

Associations of lifestyles with major chronic diseases in Chinese adults: evidence from the China Kadoorie Biobank,"['Yuanjie Pang', 'C Q Yu', 'Yugui Guo[...]', 'Lin Li']","Major chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and respiratory disease, cause substantial mortality and morbidity in China. Evidence from Western population showed that smoking, excessive alcohol intake, physical inactivity, unhealthful dietary habits and adiposity are independent risk factors for major chronic diseases. However, because of the vast differences in lifestyles and disease patterns, evidence from Western populations may not be generalizable to the Chinese population. Assessing the directions and magnitude of associations between lifestyles and major chronic diseases is crucial to evaluate the benefits yielded from lifestyle modifications, thus informing related guidelines. In recent years, prospective cohort studies in China, including the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB), have shown relationships between unfavorable lifestyle factors and major chronic diseases. In particular, the CKB study has laid the evidence base for lifestyle factors (occupational physical activity) and diseases (hemorrhagic stroke, gastrointestinal cancers, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) unique to the Chinese population.

The effect of computerisation on the wage share in United Kingdom workplaces,['Nicola Pensiero'],"This historical paper analyses the distributional consequences of computerisation on the wage share of income in United Kingdom (UK) workplaces in the first decade of this century. The reasons why computerisation might increase a firm’s income but reduce the share assigned to wages are still not well understood. The uniquely rich Workplace Employment Relations Survey (WERS) 2004–2011 includes firm-level measures of the main production inputs and outputs, and thus allows an analysis of the main mechanisms through which increased computer usage influenced the wage share of income in UK workplaces over this period. This analysis shows that the proportion of employees using computers impacted the wage share in ways that were at odds with two mainstream views: that computers complement capital, and that labour can be easily replaced by capital. The results show that the proportion of employees using computers reduced the wage share by disproportionally increasing the productivity of the least skilled employees, who were not proportionally compensated for their increase in productivity. The stability of the wage share, over the period of interest, is explained by the rise in a workplace’s share of professional employees and by a rise in work effort. This positive contribution to the wage share was counteracted by an increased share of employees using computers and by a reduction in the share of employees whose pay was negotiated by unions, thereby contributing to a decline in the wage share of firm income.

Experimental UK regional consumer price inflation with model‐based expenditure weights,"['James Dawber', 'Nora Würz', 'Paul A. Smith[...]', 'Nikolaos Tzavidis']","Like many other countries, the UK produces a national consumer price index (CPI) to measure inflation. Presently, CPI measures are not produced for regions within the UK. It is believed that, using only available data sources, a regional CPI would not be precise or reliable enough as an official statistic, primarily because the regional partitioning of the data makes sample sizes too small. We investigate this claim by producing experimental regional CPIs using publicly available price data, and deriving expenditure weights from the Living Costs and Food survey. We detail the methods and challenges of developing a regional CPI and evaluate its reliability. We then assess whether model-based methods such as smoothing and small area estimation significantly improve the measures. We find that a regional CPI can be produced with available data sources, however it appears to be excessively volatile over time, mainly due to the weights. Smoothing and small area estimation improve the reliability of the regional CPI series to some extent but they remain too volatile for regional policy use. This research provides a valuable framework for the development of a more viable regional CPI measure for the UK in the future.",Article,1 , Journal of Official Statistics,,0,"

SP cells were identified and characterized by flow cytometry using Hoechst 33342 dye staining from a highly metastatic human pancreatic cancer cell line (L3.6pl). Antagomir transfection was performed using miRNA-21 and miRNA-221 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and followed by detection of cell apoptosis, cell cycle progression, chemosensitivity, and invasion. Sorted SP cells from gemcitabine-resistant L3.6pl cells (L3.6plGres-SP) cells were orthotopically implanted in nude mice with or without miRNA-21 and miRNA-221 ASOs mono- and combination therapy. The administration of antagomir-21 and antagomir-221 significantly reduced the SP cell fraction, decreased SP cell differentiation, and downstream gene regulation, and thereby induced reduction of L3.6pl cell proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance against gemcitabine and 5-Fluorouracil. Combination of ASOs therapy against miRNA-21 and miRNA-221 significantly inhibited primary tumor growth and metastasis compared to single antagomir treatment, especially, in L3.6plGres-SP-induced pancreatic tumor growth in vivo. These findings further indicate that the inhibition of miR-21 and miR-221 appear particularly suitable to target stem-like subpopulations and address their specific biological function to prom

Transport Systems Conferring Pathogenicity to Escherichia coli,['Fengyi Tang'],"Escherichia coli K12 are currently the best-understood organism on Earth; a larger fraction of its genes have been functionally characterized than for any other organisms. However, organisms given this species designation are extremely diverse, genetically and phenotypically. E. coli proves to be a valuable model system for understanding bacterial physiology, metabolism, genetics and pathogenesis. Why has E. coli been so much more extensively studied than any other bacterium on Earth? It all began with the German pediatrician and bacteriologist, Theodor Escherich, who was dismayed to find that so many babies were dying of diarrhea diseases. In fact, we now know that E. coli is one of the top causes of infant mortality, adult diarrhea and urinary tract infections worldwide. It was because of the organism's broad host specificity and ability to cause many different diseases in large numbers of animals, including humans, that it was first selected as an important bacterium for study. More recently, it has been found that certain strains of E. coli are probiotic, having beneficial effects on host animals, counteracting the detrimental consequences of their pathogenic counterparts. Genetic analyses have revealed that the tremendous phenotypic diversity of the hundreds of currently recognized E. coli strains resulted from the frequent occurrence of horizontal gene transfer during the evolutionary divergence of the Escherichia genus. In fact, the pan genome of E. coli far exceeds the core genome, by up to 20-fold or more. Thus E. coli should not be thought of as an entity or species; it represents an entire spectrum of related organisms sharing only the core housekeeping genes.",Article,4 , Journal of Medical Microbiology & Diagnosis,,0,"

Learning inequalities during the Covid-19 pandemic. A longitudinal analysis using the UK Understanding Society 2020 and 2021 data,"['Nicola Pensiero', 'Anthony Kelly', 'Christian Bokhove']","•The transition to distance schooling has exacerbated inequalities by socio-economic status (SES) due both to the gap in the volume of schoolwork completed and to the relative ability or inability of some parents to support their children’s learning. •While parental occupation alone was found to be a significant determinant of differences in the volume of schoolwork among students, its effect was amplified when combined with student access to computers, family circumstances and parental working patterns. •The provision of schoolwork improved in both primary and secondary schools in the second closure period (January 2021 through February 2021) compared to the first school closure period (from late March 2020 to the start of June 2020). The number of offline and online lessons per day increased and this led to a larger volume of schoolwork being done, from 2.3 hours per day to 3.3 hours per day in primary schools, and from 2.6 hours per day to 4 hours per day in secondary schools. •The increase in schoolwork provision can be explained by the improved provision of lessons, by greater availability of computers and by the fact that families were better prepared for the second school closure and could engage more with the schoolwork provided. •The results show that in January 2021 the gaps between ‘service class’ students (students whose parents are large employers, higher managers and professionals) and ‘routine class’ students (students whose parents are in routine and semi-routine sales, service, technical, agricultural and clerical occupations) reduced and became non-significant for primary school pupils.

Methodologies of extraction: The mining techniques in the Early Neolithic flint mines of Southern England and their continental origins,['Jon Baczkowski'],"Recent research on the chronology of the Early Neolithic (4000-3500 BC) in Southern England has shown that flint mines are amongst the earliest monuments to appear in the landscape. This paper will outline the findings from research into extraction methodologies at the mines of Southern England. It is proposed that these methods are also observable in the flint mines of Northwest Europe. It is also argued that at present there is no evidence of a chronological development from proto-mines to deep flint mines in Southern England. To support this hypothesis the unpublished excavation of the only known Neolithic drift mines in Southern England, on Harrow Hill, West Sussex, will be investigated. Finally, a review of the radiocarbon dates of Southern English flint mines is undertaken, which places these significant monuments into a chronological model and further demonstrates a link to their continental counterparts. Résumé Les recherches récentes sur la chronologie du Néolithique ancien (4000-3500 BC) du sud de l'Angleterre ont montré que les mines de silex figurent parmi les plus anciens monuments apparaissant dans le paysage.

Our results are consistent with post-Newtonian calculations in the weak field and they agree remarkably well with numerical-relativity simulations of comparable-mass binaries in the strong field. We also find good agreement for binaries with a spinning secondary or a slowly spinning primary.

Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify the hub genes related to hypoxic adaptation in yak (Bos grunniens),"['Qi Bao', 'Xiaolan Zhang', 'Pengjia Bao[...]', 'pl Yan']","Background As a mammal living at the highest altitude in the world, the yak has strong adaptability to the harsh natural environment (such as low temperature, scarce food, especially low oxygen) of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) after a long process of natural selection.Objective Here, we used Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA), a systematic biology method, to identify hypoxic adaptation-related modules and hub genes. The research of the adaptability of yak against hypoxia is of great significance to identify the genetic characteristics and yak breeding.Methods Based on the transcriptome sequencing data (PRJNA362606), the R package DESeq2 and WGCNA were conducted to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and construct the gene co-expression network. The module hub genes were identified and characterized by the correlation of gene and trait, module membership (kME). In addition, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were used to explore the functions of hub genes.ResultsOur results revealed that 1098, 1429, and 1645 DEGs were identified in muscle, spleen, and lung, respectively. Besides, a total of 13 gene co-expression modules were detected, of which two hypoxic adaptation-related modules (saddlebrown and turquoise) were found. We identified 39 and 150 hub genes in these two modules. Functional enrichment analyses showed that 12 GO terms and 18 KEGG pathways were enriched in the saddlebrown module while 85 GO terms and 22 KEGG pathways were enriched in the turquoise module.

Methods Following contact force (CF) PVI (continuous RF, 30W) using general anaesthesia and automated RF annotation‐guidance (VISITAG™: force‐over‐time 100% minimum 1g; 2mm position stability; ACCURESP™ RMA “off”) in 25 patients, we retrospectively examined RMA settings “on” versus “off” at the left atrial posterior wall (LAPW). Results Respiratory motion detection occurred in 8, permitting offline retrospective comparison of RMA settings. Significant differences in LAPW RF auto‐annotation occurred according to RMA setting, with curves displaying catheter position, CF and impedance data indicating “best‐fit” for catheter motion detection using RMA “off”. Comparing RMA “on” versus “off”, respectively: Total annotated sites 82 versus 98; median RF duration per‐site 13.3s versus 10.6s (p<0.0001); median force time integral 177g.s versus 130g.s (p=0.0002); mean inter‐tag distance (ITD) 6.0mm versus 4.8mm (p=0.002). Considering LAPW annotated site 1‐to‐2 transitions resulting from deliberate catheter movement, 3 concurrent with inadvertent 0g CF demonstrated <0.6s difference in RF duration. However, 13 deliberate catheter movements during constant tissue contact (ITD range 2.1 – 7.0mm) demonstrated (mean) site‐1 RF duration difference 3.7s (range: ‐1.3 to 11.3s): considering multiple measures of catheter position instability, the appropriate indication of deliberate catheter motion occurred with RMA “off” in all.

Flexible generation conversion and exchange of fiber guided orbital angular momentum modes using helical gratings,"['Liang Fang', 'Jian Wang']","By exploiting helical gratings (HGs), we propose and simulate flexible generation, conversion and exchange of fiber guided orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes. HGs can enable the generation of OAM modes, and the OAM conversion between two arbitrary modes guided in fibers. A specific HG can exchange the OAM states of a couple of OAM modes, i.e, OAM exchange. In addition, a Fabry Perot cavity cascaded with two identical reflective HGs can reflect converted OAM modes with a comb spectrum. The HGs based generation conversion and exchange of OAM modes are dependent on helix period, orientation, and the fold number of helical fringes. The proposed method of generation, conversion, and exchange of fiber guided OAM modes using HGs is flexible and well compatible with OAM fibers, featuring a high conversion efficiency close to 100% and a conversion bandwidth about 10 nm in transmission spectra, while less than 1 nm in reflection spectra.",Preprint,,,,0,"

Effect of Intraoperative Ventilation Strategies on Postoperative Pulmonary Complications: A Meta-Analysis,"['Min Lei', 'Qi Bao', 'Huanyu Luo[...]', 'Junran Xie']","Introduction: The role of intraoperative ventilation strategies in subjects undergoing surgery is still contested. This meta-analysis study was performed to assess the relationship between the low tidal volumes strategy and conventional mechanical ventilation in subjects undergoing surgery. Methods: A systematic literature search up to December 2020 was performed in OVID, Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Google scholar, and 28 studies including 11,846 subjects undergoing surgery at baseline and reporting a total of 2,638 receiving the low tidal volumes strategy and 3,632 receiving conventional mechanical ventilation, were found recording relationships between low tidal volumes strategy and conventional mechanical ventilation in subjects undergoing surgery. Odds ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated between the low tidal volumes strategy vs. conventional mechanical ventilation using dichotomous and continuous methods with a random or fixed-effect model. Results: The low tidal volumes strategy during surgery was significantly related to a lower rate of postoperative pulmonary complications (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.44–0.83, p < 0.001), aspiration pneumonitis (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46–0.86, p < 0.001), and pleural effusion (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56–0.92, p < 0.001) compared to conventional mechanical ventilation.

A Trajectory Optimization-Based Intersection Coordination Framework for Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles,"['Yixiao Zhang', 'Rui Hao', 'Tingting Zhang[...]', 'Qinyu Zhang']","Since vehicles from multiple roads frequently merge at intersections, it formulates a typical traffic bottleneck of modern transportation systems. Proper vehicle coordination and motion plan at road intersections are of importance to guarantee safety as well as improving the traffic throughput, fuel efficiency and so on. In this paper, we try to present a general dedicated intersection coordination framework for autonomous vehicles, where both high- and low-level planners are appropriately designed and integrated. In the high-level planner, two different strategies are formulated to coordinate the autonomous vehicles to generate reference trajectories and feasible ""tunnels"", respectively. Especially, a novel space-time-block based resource allocation scheme is presented to describe the feasible tunnels. Furthermore, to avoid collisions with unexpected obstacles such as pedestrians, bicycles or other vehicles with human drivers, a low-level planner is designed to generate practical trajectories based on the solutions from the high-level planner, according to their local on-board observations. Simulations and practical experiments are carried out, to show that our proposed coordination framework can achieve obvious performance advantages in various traffic metrics, including the throughput, fairness in driving maneuvers and driving comfort, etc. We also find that the high-level planner is effective in eliminating possible deadlocks among autonomous vehicles, which is rarely discussed in existing investigations.",Article,1 , IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,Dec 18,0,"

Methods: Detailed information regarding passive smoking behaviors related to 317 486 non-smokers who were 30-79 years old from the 10 study regions were gathered and analyzed. Results: Following the standardization of the 2010 China national population, the prevalence rate of passive smoking was 56.7%, and the prevalence rate of living with smokers was 66.5% among the Chinese adults. Both of the aforementioned rates were higher in rural than in urban areas. Meanwhile, the regional distribution of weekly passive smoking frequency and cumulative duration of passive smoking per week and cumulative duration of passive smoking per day were significantly different. The cumulative passive smoking duration per week increased along with the weekly frequency in people living in urban areas.

A label-free lead(II) ion sensor based on surface plasmon resonance and DNAzyme-gold nanoparticle conjugates,"['Huanan Wu', 'Shuokang Wang', 'Sam Fong Yau Li[...]', 'Qiyong Xu']","Detection of lead(II) (Pb2+) ions in water is important for the protection of human health and environment. The growing demand for onsite detection still faces challenges for sensitive and easy-to-use methods. In this work, a novel surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor based on GR-5 DNAzyme and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was developed. Thiolated DNAzyme was immobilized on the gold surface of the sensor chip followed by anchoring the substrate-functionalized AuNPs through the DNAzyme-substrate hybridization. The coupling between the localized surface plasmon (LSP) of AuNPs and the surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) on the gold sensor surface was used to improve the sensitivity. The substrate cleavage in the presence of Pb2+ ions was catalyzed by DNAzyme, leading to the removal of AuNPs and the diminished LSP-SPP coupling. The optimal detection limit was 80 pM for the sensor fabricated with 1 μM DNAzyme, corresponding to two or three orders of magnitude lower than the toxicity levels of Pb2+ in drinking water defined by WHO and USEPA. By tuning the surface coverage of DNAzyme, the sensitivity and dynamic range could be controlled. This sensor also featured high selectivity to Pb2+ ions and simple detection procedure. Successful detection of Pb2+ ions in groundwater indicates that this method has the prospect in the onsite detection of Pb2+ ions in water. Given the variety of AuNPs and metal-specific DNAzymes, this detection strategy would lead to the development of more sensitive and versatile heavy metal sensors.

Study on Detecting Dielectric Properties of Typical Electrical Insulation Materials by Terahertz Wave Spectroscopy,"['Hongwei Mei', 'Lanxin Li', 'Fanghui Yin[...]', 'Liming Wang']","The dielectric properties of the electrical insulation materials is of great importance to the safe operation of the power system. As a promising technique in the field of material testing and with the very adaptive physical modeling of wave transmission process, terahertz wave was used to measure the dielectric properties of five commonly used insulation materials by two methods in this paper. When excluding the echo pulse from the reference signal and the sample signal, a better signal-noise ratio and a wider effective frequency band of spectrums can be obtained. Alternatively, the dielectric properties can also be achieved by separating the main pulse and echo pulse from the sample signal. The latter method makes the sampling of reference signal unnecessary. Furthermore, the dielectric properties of materials were also measured on a relative lower frequency band (1Hz-1MHz) by the broadband dielectric spectrometer. Compared with a relatively lower frequency band, due to the polarization, the dielectric constant of the tested insulation materials was lower on the terahertz band while the dielectric loss tangent was generally higher except the epoxy resin.",Article,0 , IEEE Access,"Dec 31, 2020",1,"

The color of NBB:3%Ce³⁺, xTb³⁺, 0.5%Sm³⁺ can shift from light violet thought white to yellow. And NBB:3%Ce³⁺, zDy³⁺ can give out white light and move to green field. Moreover, the thermal stability makes NBB:3%Ce³⁺, 0.2%Dy³⁺ be a potential candidate for the self-referencing luminescent thermometry.",Article,9 , Journal of Luminescence,,0,"

A Trajectory Optimization Based Intersection Coordination Framework for Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles,"['Yixiao Zhang', 'Rui Hao', 'Tingting Zhang[...]', 'Qinyu Zhang']","Since vehicles from multiple roads frequently merge at intersections, it formulates a typical traffic bottleneck of modern transportation systems. Proper vehicle coordination and motion plan at road intersections are of importance to guarantee safety as well as improving the traffic throughput, fuel efficiency and so on. In this paper, we try to present a general dedicated intersection coordination framework for autonomous vehicles, where both high-and low-level planners are appropriately designed and integrated. In the high-level planner, two different strategies are formulated to coordinate the autonomous vehicles to generate reference trajectories and feasible ""tunnels"", respectively. Especially, a novel space-time-block based resource allocation scheme is presented to describe the feasible tunnels. Furthermore, to avoid collisions with unexpected obstacles such as pedestrians, bicycles or other vehicles with human drivers, a low-level planner is designed to generate practical trajectories based on the solutions from the high-level planner, according to their local on-board observations. Simulations and practical experiments are carried out, to show that our proposed coordination framework can achieve obvious performance advantages in various traffic metrics, including the throughput, fairness in driving maneuvers and driving comfort, etc. We also find that the high-level planner is effective in eliminating possible deadlocks among autonomous vehicles, which is rarely discussed in existing investigations.",Preprint,,,May 26,1,"

Joint Oligopoly-Oligopsony Model with Wage Markdown Power,"['Jian Tong', 'Carmine Ornaghi']","In imperfectly competitive markets, a producer-employer firm can be considered monopolist-monopsonist, facing downward sloping residual demand for product and upward sloping residual supply for labour, and can thereby exercise both product price markup and wage markdown powers. To study market outcomes in this setting, we define a Joint Oligopoly-Oligopsony Model (JOOM) - an extended Cournot oligopoly model with imperfectly competitive labour market - and derive its Cournot-Nash equilibrium, featuring the relationship between market structure and market power, price and wage, output and employment, and investigate its welfare implications. We also extend the partial equilibrium welfare analysis to include Worker Surplus. By elevating Worker Surplus on a par with Consumer Surplus as suitable welfare standards, the JOOM makes apparent the potentially efficiency-enhancing function of labour union and minimum wage regulation, aimed at curbing oligopsony wage markdown power. We show that a lax merger control, which permits consolidation of market structure, can weaken the worker power in the form of reducing efficient minimum wage, as well as employment. Furthermore, we use the JOOM theory to investigate the effect of superstar firms on market outcomes. We show that the superstar firm hypothesis can explain the rise of average labour productivity, the fall of labour income share and wage stagnation at the industry level: all stylised facts consistent with the empirical findings of Autor et al (2020). Our analysis shows that the superstar firm phenomenon can have an ambiguous welfare effect once we take worker welfare into consideration.",Research,,,,1,"

Athenian ideology in Demosthenes’ deliberative oratory: hailing the dēmos,['Sarah Bremner'],"This thesis examines Demosthenes’ rhetorical use of Athenian ideology in his deliberative speeches from 351-341 BCE. I argue that during this period of crisis, which is usually narrated in terms of conflict with Macedonia, Demosthenes confronts an internal crisis within the Assembly. While Demosthenes’ deliberative speeches have traditionally been defined as ‘Philippic’, this thesis argues that the speeches do not prioritise an ‘Anti- Macedonian’ agenda, but rather focus on confronting the corruption of the deliberative decision-making process. Due to an attitude of apathy and neglect, Demosthenes’ rhetoric suggests that their external problems are a direct product of this internal crisis, both of which are perpetuated by their failure to recognise how self-sabotaging practices undermine the polis from within. As he asserts in On the Chersonese and the Third Philippic, they cannot hope to deal with their external situation before they deal with their internal crisis. To address this, I argue that Demosthenes’ parrhēsia interweaves criticism of the dēmos with the praise of Athens, using social memory and past exempla both to recall and prescribe didactically the attitudes central to Athenian identity. As such, I propose that the deliberative speeches do not confront a ‘Macedonian Question’, but a fundamentally Athenian one.

A descriptive analysis on body mass index distribution in adult twin pairs in China,"['H X Peng', 'W J Gao', 'Jinghui Lyu[...]', 'Lin Li']","Objective: To describe the differences in body mass index (BMI) distribution in adult twins registered in Chinese National Twin Registry (CNTR), and provide evidence for the risk factor analysis and prevention and control of overweight or obesity. Methods: A total of 32 725 twin pairs aged 18 years and above who completed the questionnaire survey during 2010-2018 and had complete registered information in CNTR and normal body weight and length were included in the analysis on the population and region specific distributions of BMI of twin pairs and the difference in BMI in twin pairs. Results: The twin pairs included in the analysis were aged (34.6±12.4) years, the twin pairs of same gender accounted for 79.7%. The average BMI was 22.5 kg/m2. The overall prevalence of obesity and overweight was 4.9% and 23.7%, respectively. Participants who were men, 50-59 years old, married, had lower education level, and lived in northern China had higher overweight rate and obesity rate (P<0.001). The difference in overweight or obesity prevalence between monozygotic (MZ) twin pars and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs was not significant, but firstborn twin pairs had slightly higher rates of overweight and obesity than later-born twin pairs (P<0.05). The analysis in same gender-twin pairs indicated that the difference in BMI was associated with age (trend test: P<0.001), and the difference was more obvious in DZ twin pair in MZ pair and this difference increased with age. The concordant rate of BMI was higher in MZ twin pairs than DZ twin pairs (P<0.05). Conclusion: The distribution of BMI of twin pairs varied with population and region and BMI varied with age due to its genetic nature.",Article,1 , Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,,0,"

Platelet‐Mimicking Therapeutic System for Noninvasive Mitigation of the Progression of Atherosclerotic Plaques,"['Yi Ma', 'Yuxuan Ma', 'Mengqiu Gao[...]', 'Yi Liu']","Atherosclerotic plaque is the primary cause of cardiovascular disorders and remains a therapeutic hurdle for the early intervention of atherosclerosis. Traditional clinical strategies are often limited by surgery‐related complications or unsatisfactory effects of long‐term drug administration. Inspired by the plaque‐binding ability of platelets, a biomimic photodynamic therapeutic system is designed to mitigate the progression of atherosclerotic plaques. This system is composed of photosensitizer‐loaded upconversion nanoparticle cores entrapped in the platelet membrane. The platelet membrane coating facilitates specific targeting of the therapeutic system to macrophage‐derived foam cells, the hallmark, and main component of early stage atherosclerotic plaques, which is firmly confirmed by in vivo fluorescent and single‐photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) radionuclide imaging. Importantly, in vivo phototherapy guided by SPECT/CT imaging alleviates plaque progression. Further immunofluorescence analysis reveals foam cell apoptosis and ameliorated inflammation. This biomimic system, which combines plaque‐binding with radionuclide imaging guidance, is a novel, noninvasive, and potent strategy to mitigate the progression of atherosclerotic plaque.",Article,1 , Advanced Science,Feb 18,1,"

Gene-body mass index interaction on coronary heart disease in Chinese adult twins,"['Y E Xi', 'W J Gao', 'Jinghui Lyu[...]', 'Lin Li']","Objective: To explore the gene-body mass index (BMI) interaction on coronary heart disease (CHD) in the Chinese adult twins. Methods: A total of 20 340 same-sex twin pairs registered in the Chinese National Twin Registry (CNTR) were enrolled in this study. Classical twin structure equation model was used to estimate the gene-BMI interaction on CHD. Results: After adjusting for age, we found that genetic variance of CHD differed as the function of BMI in male twins, which indicated the presence of a gene-BMI interaction on CHD (P=0.008).The genetic moderating effect (βa) was -0.14 (95%CI: -0.22--0.04), indicating that for each logarithmic transformation value of BMI increase, genetic path parameters would decrease by 0.14, which would result in the decrease of genetic variance of CHD. And the heritability of CHD was 0.77 (95%CI: 0.65-0.86) among the male twins with lower BMI (<24.0 kg/m2), but 0.56 (95%CI: 0.33-0.74) among the male twins with high BMI (≥24.0 kg/m2). However, there was no evidence suggesting that BMI could moderate genetic variants of CHD in female. Conclusion: We found a significant gene-BMI interaction on CHD in the Chinese male adult twins in China, and the heritability of CHD was higher among the twins whose BMI was <24.0 kg/m2.",Article,1 , Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,,0,"

Self-rated health measures and their relations to all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in adults from 10 regions of China,"['W W Dong', 'J Wu', 'C Q Yu[...]', 'Lin Li']","Objective: To examine the association between self-rated health status (SRH) and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Methods: A total of 512 713 adults aged 30-79 years from 10 areas of China were followed from baseline (2004-2008) until 31 December 2016 in the China Kadoorie Biobank study. Global and age-comparative SRH [general self-rated health status (GSRH) and age-comparative self-rated health status (ASRH), respectively] were asked in baseline questionnaires. Causes for mortality were monitored through linkage with established Disease Surveillance Point system and health insurance records. Multivariable Cox proportional regression models were used to estimate the HRs and 95%CIs for the association between SRH measures and all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. Results: During an average of 9.9 years' follow-up, 44 065 deaths were recorded, among which 17 648 were from cardiovascular disease. Compared with excellent GSRH, the HR(95%CI) for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality associated with poor GSRH was 1.84(1.78-1.91) and 1.94(1.82-2.06), respectively. Relative to better ASRH, the HR(95%CI) for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality associated with worse ASRH was 1.75(1.70-1.81) and 1.83(1.73-1.92), respectively. Conclusion: In this large prospective cohort study in China, participants reporting poor GSRH or worse ASRH had significantly higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.",Article,1 , Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,Nov 27,0,"

Bayesian Model-Based Approach: Impact on Science and Policy,"['Jakub Bijak', 'Martin Hinsch', 'Sarah Nurse[...]', 'Oliver Reinhardt']","In this chapter, we summarise the scientific and policy implications of the Bayesian model-based approach, starting from an evaluation of its possible advantages, limitations, and potential to influence further scientific developments, policy and practice. We focus here specifically on the role of limits of knowledge and reducible (epistemic), as well as irreducible (aleatory) uncertainty. To that end, we also reflect on the scientific risk-benefit trade-offs of applying the proposed approaches. We discuss the usefulness of proposed methods for policy, exploring a variety of uses, from scenario analysis, to foresight studies, stress testing and early warnings, as well as contingency planning, illustrated with examples generated by the Risk and Rumours models presented earlier in this book. We conclude the chapter by providing several practical recommendations for the potential users of our approach, including a blueprint for producing and assessing the impact of policy interventions in various parts of the social system being modelled.",Chapter,,,,0,"

A multi-omics approach to investigate the etiology of non-communicable diseases: recent advance and applications,"['Yuanjie Pang', 'Jinghui Lyu', 'C Q Yu[...]', 'L M Li']","One of the main aims of chronic disease epidemiology is to explore the etiological factors of diseases. Multi-omics includes all genes (genomics), extensive changes in gene expression (epigenetics), ribonucleic acids (transcriptomics), and proteins (proteomics) generated during the process of DNA replication, transcription, translation, and post-translational modification, as well as small molecule metabolites downstream (metabolomics). Multi-omics platforms provide technical support for assessing omics biomarkers including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, while systems epidemiology provides theoretical and methodological support for using multi-omics to conduct etiological research. Multi-omics research not only reveals the interaction network between molecules, but also contributes to causal inference from the molecular level. With the global exponential growth of publicly available data, analysis platforms, and consortia, resources for multi-omics research will become more abundant, and the depth and breadth of research will be greatly expanded. This article will review the applications of multi-omics approach in the etiologic research on non-communicable diseases, representative research in the past three years, opportunities and challenges for large-scale cohort studies, advantages and issues of multi-omics research in the Chinese population, and future perspectives.",Article,1 , Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,,0,"

White-Collar Cybercrime: Evaluating the Redefinition of a Criminological Artifact,['Christopher Hamerton'],"This paper explores the cause and effect of cybercrime from the perspective of what has been termed white-collar cybercrime, providing a layered analysis of established theoretical models and typologies and evaluating these to determine where white-collar cybercrime might fit within the evolving discipline of cybercriminology and wider interdisciplinary social sphere. White-collar crime itself offers the rare example of a criminological theory that has the attributes of an artifact - establishing a distinct criminal offence type within law and criminal justice and entering mainstream knowledge and terminology within half a century of inception. Despite this, white-collar cybercrime is a relatively new concept for cyber criminological analysis and is currently a rarity within the academic literature. Thus, the piece primarily seeks to compliment and expand recent scholarship in offering further critical evaluation of an important emergent model. This is done in terms of its history, evolution, characteristics, position within social change theory, and via examination of some of the many policy, practice and security challenges that appear inherent to the modern networked workplace.",Article,0 , Journal of Law and Criminal Justice,,0,"

Methods: The selection principles of GWASs were established based on previous studies. The process of manual filtering in the GWAS Catalog was abstracted as standard algorithms. The R script (gwasfilter.R) was written by two programmers and tested many times. Results: It takes six steps for gwasfilter.R to filter GWASs. There are five main self-defined functions among this R script. GWASs can be filtered based on ""whether the GWAS has been replicated"" ""sample size"" ""ethnicity of the study population"" and other conditions. It takes no more than 1 second for this script to filter GWASs of a single trait. Conclusions: This R script (gwasfilter.R) is user-friendly and provides an efficient and standard process to filter GWASs flexibly.

Study of etiology and esophageal motility characteristics of esophagogastric junction outlet obstruction patients,"['K Wang', 'Z J Xu', 'Yurong Ge[...]', 'L P Duan']","Objective: To analyze the causes of the esophagogastric junction outlet obstruction (EGJOO) patients, to discuss the differences of the clinical manifestation and esophageal motility characteristics between the anatomic EGJOO (A-EGJOO) and functional EGJOO (F-EGJOO) subgroups, and to search the diagnostic values of the specific metrics for differentiating the subgroups of EGJOO patients. Methods: For the current retrospective study, all the patients who underwent the esophageal high resonance manometry test were retrospectively analyzed from Jan 2012 to Oct 2018 in Peking University Third Hospital. The EGJOO patients were enrolled in the following research. The clinical characteristics, such as symptoms and causes of the patients were studied. Then the patients were divided into two subgroups as A-EGJOO subgroup and F-EGJOO subgroup. The clinical symptoms and the main manometry metrics were compared between these two subgroups. The significant different metrics between the two groups were selected to draw receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the diagnostic values were analyzed in differentiating the A-EGJOO and F-EGJOO subgroups. Results: The most common symptom of EGJOO was chest pain or chest discomfort (30.63%), then the dysphagia (29.73%), and acid regurgitation/heartburn (27.03%). Non-erosive reflux disease (36.04%) was the most popular cause for EGJOO, then the reflux esophagitis (17.12%). Besides the intra-EGJOO and extra-EGJOO lesions, the connective tissue disease (6.31%) and central nervous diseases (2.70%) were found to be the etiology of EGJOO.

Chinese herbal medicine Tangshen Formula treatment for type 2 diabetic kidney disease in the early stage: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"['De Jin', 'Wen-Jing Huang', 'Xiang Meng[...]', 'Xiao-Lin Tong']","Background: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the main cause of end-stage kidney disease and has become a heavy economic and social burden due to its high prevalence and morbidity. The most effective strategy is that patients with DKD should be diagnosed and treated early. Preliminary studies showed that the Chinese herbal Tangshen Formula (TSF) may delay the progression of DKD, reducing microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria and improving renal function. We designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of TSF in patients with DKD. Methods/design: This trial is a 13-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 632 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an experiment group (TSF plus losartan) and a control group (placebo plus losartan). The trial cycle will last 24 weeks. The primary outcome will be the change in the urine microalbumin-creatinine ratio from baseline to week 24. The secondary outcome will be the change in the rate of progression to the clinical proteinuria period after intervention, the rate of urine microalbumin negative conversion, the rate of normal urinary microalbumin, the doubling rate of the baseline creatinine value and the glomerular filtration rate between the two groups. Safety in medication will also be evaluated. Discussion: We hypothesize that patients with type 2 diabetes in the early stage of DKD will benefit from TSF. If successful, this study will provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03009864. Registered January 2017.",Article,9 , Trials,,1,"

Detection of Small Defects in Composite Insulators Using Terahertz Technique and Deconvolution Method,"['Hongwei Mei', 'Huaiyuan Jiang', 'Fanghui Yin[...]', 'Liming Wang']","After a long-term operation, defects may occur in the composite insulators and threat the safe operation of the power transmission. To secure the power transmission system, it would be beneficial to detect the defects in their initial stage. In this paper, the terahertz technique combined with a deconvolution method was proposed, and a terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system was built. To validate the method proposed, three types of defects, namely single air gap defect, inclusion defect, and double-layer air gap defect were artificially prepared and tested. According to the test results, it was found that, compared with the traditional terahertz method, the air gap size that could lead to pulse overlapping was reduced from 1.22 mm to 0.57 mm. After the deconvolution process, air gap defect as small as 0.173 mm could be distinguished due to the shape characteristics of unipolar pulse. It was also found that when the defect was damp, the obtained waveform near the defect became smooth. The results of the present study demonstrate that terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS), combined with the deconvolution method, can have high potential in the detection of defects in composite insulators.",Article,0 , IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,,1,"

"Prevalence, patterns and long-term changes of multimorbidity in adults from 10 regions of China","['Z J Sun', 'J N Fan', 'C Q Yu[...]', 'Lin Li']","Objective: To describe the prevalence of multimorbidity and its secular trend, and to explore the common patterns of multimorbidity in Chinese adults. Methods: A total of 25 033 participants who attended the second resurvey of China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) were included in the study. We used data collected both at baseline (2004-2008) and at resurvey (2013-2014). A total of 13 chronic conditions were included, defined by self-reported, physical examination, and blood sample testing. Multimorbidity was defined as co-existence of two or more chronic conditions. Patterns of multimorbidity were explored using hierarchical cluster analysis. Results: The mean age of participants was (51.5±10.1) years at baseline and (59.5±10.2) years at second resurvey. The prevalence of multimorbidity increased from 33.5% to 58.1% over (8.0±0.8) years of follow-up. The average number of chronic conditions per person increased from 1.15 to 1.82 and all participants increased 0.42 conditions per 5 years on average. Participants who were older, less educated or lived in urban areas had a higher prevalence of multimorbidity and a higher increase in the number of chronic conditions. The increase in the number of chronic conditions was also higher among smokers and heavy alcohol drinkers. The most common multimorbidity pattern in the present population consisted of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and heart disease. Conclusions: The prevalence of multimorbidity in Chinese adults is increasing rapidly due to ageing population. Populations of different sociodemographic background and lifestyle habits may have different prevalence of multimorbidity and changes in rates over time.",Article,1 , Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,,0,"

All-fiber polarization-manageable directional couplers,"['Liang Fang', 'Jian Wang']","Flexible management of light polarization is necessary to develop the technologies of optical fiber communications. However, it is still a great challenge to manipulate optical polarization in all-fiberbased devices. Here we present a novel structural design of three-core fiber couplers to create arbitrary polarization management by embedding a vector mode segregated core within the conventional fiber couplers. We take advantages of these coupling structures to achieve polarization split, rotation, and exchange, as three essential polarization managements for fiber-guided modes. We study these couplers based on coupled-mode theory and numerically simulations. The obtained results show that they manifest favorable operation performance on management of the fiber modal polarization states. Compared to previous couplers used for management of power, wavelengths and modal forms, this kind of fiber couplers introduces a new manageable degree of freedom for modal polarization. It is expected that the presented all-fiber polarization-manageable directional couplers might find potential applications in fiber optical communications and sensing systems.",Preprint,,,,0,"

Sample excavations at two of these sites, Long Down and Harrow Hill, revealed that ploughing had truncated nearly all the surviving remains in those areas under cultivation. The flintwork, pottery and organic material retrieved from the excavations provided information on the flint artefacts produced at these sites, and fragments of possibly carinated pottery, together with radiocarbon dating, proved that mining took place at Long Down in the early neolithic period (4000–3500 BC). The discovery of drift mines at Harrow Hill is significant, as they are the only open-cast or drift mines to have been investigated at a prehistoric flint mining site in southern England.
