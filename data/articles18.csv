COVID-19 Scientific Facts vs. Conspiracy Theories: Is Science Failing to Pass Its Message?,"['Marios Constantinou', 'Antonios Kagialis', 'Maria Karekla']","Science may be failing to convince a significant number of people about COVID-19 scientific facts and needed public health measures. Individual and social factors are behind believing conspiracy theories. Adults (N = 1001) were asked to rate their beliefs in various conspiracy theories circulating in social media, rate their psychological distress relating to COVID-19, rate their trust in science to solve COVID-19 problems, and rate their willingness to adhere to measures regarding social distancing and quarantine. The findings showed conspiracy theories are widely believed and related to lower age, lower education, living in less densely populated areas, and lower income. Stronger conspiracy theory beliefs predicted science mistrust and unwillingness to adhere to public health measures. Psychological state was a strong predictor of conspiracy beliefs. Recommendations, stemming from the findings, for reducing such beliefs and better serving public health are discussed.",Article,1, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,Jun 14,1,"

Plurality in mating: Exploring the occurrence and contingencies of mating strategies,['Menelaos Apostolou'],"People adopt a variety of strategies in order to achieve specific mating goals. The current research nominated nine different mating strategies, and attempted to estimate their occurrence. Evidence from an online sample of 6273 Greek-speaking participants, indicated that a mixed strategy was in the highest occurrence, followed by a long-term and a short-term mating strategy. Men were more likely than women to prefer a short-term and a mixed mating strategy, and that younger participants were more likely to prefer a mixed than a long-term mating strategy. In addition, heterosexual women with same-sex attraction were more likely than exclusively heterosexual women to prefer a short-term and a mixed strategy than a long-term mating strategy. Furthermore, we found that men were more likely than women and older participants were more likely than younger participants to indicate that they would cheat on their partners if they were in a long-term intimate relationship. Furthermore , heterosexual with same-sex attraction, bisexual and homosexual men and women were more likely than exclusive heterosexual participants to indicate that they would cheat on their partners when in a long-term intimate relationship.",Article,1, Personality and Individual Differences,,0,"

Fears of compassion magnify the harmful effects of threat of COVID-19 on mental health and social safeness across 21 countries,"['Marcela Matos', 'Kirsten Mcewan', 'Martin Kanovsky[...]', 'Paul Gilbert']","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is a massive global health crisis with damaging consequences to mental health and social relationships. Exploring factors that may heighten or buffer the risk of mental health problems in this context is thus critical. Whilst compassion may be a protective factor, in contrast fears of compassion increase vulnerability to psychosocial distress and may amplify the impact of the pandemic on mental health. This study explores the magnifying effects of fears of compassion on the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on depression, anxiety and stress, and social safeness. Methods: Adult participants from the general population (N = 4057) were recruited across 21 countries worldwide, and completed self-report measures of perceived threat of COVID-19, fears of compassion (for self, from others, for others), depression, anxiety, stress, and social safeness. Results: Perceived threat of COVID-19 predicted increased depression, anxiety and stress. The three flows of fears of compassion predicted higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress and lower social safeness. All fears of compassion moderated (heightened) the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on psychological distress. Only fears of compassion from others moderated the effects of likelihood of contracting COVID-19 on social safeness. These effects were consistent across all countries. Conclusions: Fears of compassion have a universal magnifying effect on the damaging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and social safeness. Compassion focused interventions and communications could be implemented to reduce resistances to compassion and promote mental wellbeing during and following the pandemic.",Article,1, Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy,Apr 20,0,"

The effect of motorcycle safety campaign on helmet use: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"['Maryam Akbari', 'Kamran B Lankarani', 'Reza Tabrizi[...]', 'Mark J M Sullman']","Objective This systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to estimate the effectiveness of motorcycle safety campaigns for increasing helmet use among motorcycle riders and passengers. Methods PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and the Web of Science (WOS) databases were systematically searched up June 2020 for all relevant studies. The National Institute of Health (NIH) tool was used to assess the quality of all included studies. Inter-study heterogeneity was measured using the Chi-Squared and I² statistics, with the odds ratio (OR) being used as a measure of the pooled effect size. Results Out of the 561 records identified from the literature searches, eight articles (or 11 studies) were eligible for inclusion in the present meta-analysis. Using a random effects model, the results of the meta-analysis demonstrated statistically significant increases in helmet use among motorcycle riders (OR = 4.52, 95% CI: 1.01–20.14, I² = 99.9%) and passengers (OR = 6.57, 95% CI: 1.41–30.56, I² = 99.9%). The findings of sensitivity analyses, based on alternative levels of r for imputing the standard error (SE) of the ORs, showed the pooled OR of helmet use among motorcycle riders (r = 0.7; 3.49; 95% CI: 0.78, 16.44; r = 0.9; 3.49; 95% CI: 0.76, 16.11) was sensitive to different levels of r.

"P610 Fear of COVID-19 among persons with Inflammatory Bowel Disease according to employment status, educational background and residential setting, as compared to persons with other gastrointestinal conditions","['Bobby Lo', 'A Mokrowiecka', 'Antonina A Mikocka-Walus[...]', 'S R Knowles']","Background Although several studies have reported the impact of fears relating to COVID-19 on several chronic illness populations, there are few studies focused on gastrointestinal (GI) conditions. The aim was to compare how fear of COVID-19 is manifested in people living with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) compared to other GI conditions; and, how fear of COVID-19 is manifested across different demographic backgrounds (employment status, education level and country of residence) among IBD respondents using a large international sample. Methods Participants with a GI condition (≥18years of age) were recruited from 22 countries through a web-based questionnaire. Demographic, clinical, and psychosocial information was collected in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. An adaptation of the scale developed for IBD by Trindade & Ferreira (2020) measuring fear of COVID-19 (FoC; original items 1–9) and GI specific fear of COVID-19 (GI-FoC; new items 10–14) was used. Results In 831 participants (312 IBD), there were no significant differences in FoC between IBD and other GI conditions; whilst significant increases in GI-FoC were found in IBD respondents (mean [SD]: 13.5 [5.5] vs. 10.9 [5.0], p<0.01). The greatest fears of IBD respondents were: their condition would get worse; impact on access to medical support; being at increased risk of getting COVID-19; and being at increased risk of death if they got COVID-19. Among IBD respondents, persons on sick leave had significantly more general FoC than those who were employed, and significantly more GI-FoC compared to the employed or respondents outside of the labour market (Figures 1a and 1b).

"Distance Teaching of Psychology in Europe: Challenges, Lessons Learned, and Practice Examples During the First Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic","['Lenka Sokolová', 'Ioulia Papageorgi', 'Stephan Dutke[...]', 'Helen Bakker']","COVID-19 pandemic has affected many areas of our lives including education. In the time of designing this study most schools, colleges, and universities across Europe were closed and psychology educators were expected to change their teaching methods rather quickly. This study investigates how they coped with this situation, which technology and methods they used to teach psychology distantly, and which barriers and outcomes they found in this situation. Participants were N = 660 secondary school and university teachers from 28 European countries. The results showed that the participants across Europe face similar challenges in adopting distance teaching methods, which were technical and organizational rather than pedagogical. Despite the fact they found distance teaching of specific psychological contents challenging, psychology teachers also described positive aspects of distance teaching, examples of good practice and lessons learned that could be generally implemented in the teaching of psychology beyond the pandemic situation.",Article,1, Psychology Learning and Teaching,,0,"

"Can't text, I'm driving -Factors influencing intentions to text while driving in the UK","['Mark J M Sullman', 'Aneta Przepiorka', 'Agata Błachnio', 'Tetiana Hill']","There is clear research evidence that using a mobile phone while driving is dangerous. However, although drivers generally know this is a risky behaviour, many continue to use a handheld mobile phone while driving. The present research used the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to explore the psychological reasons underpinning intentions to use a mobile phone while driving in general, as well as to send and read text messages while driving across four different scenarios. Convenience sampling was used to obtain data from 314 participants who held a valid licence to drive in the UK, had driven at least once in the last six months and owned a mobile phone. General intentions to use a mobile phone while driving were predicted by positive Attitudes towards the behaviour and higher Perceived Behavioural Control. Moreover, when predicting intentions to send and read text messages, it was positive Attitudes that was the most consistent and significant predictor. Surprisingly, neither Perceived Behavioural Control nor Subjective Norms were significant predictors of intentions to send or read text messages. Furthermore, perceptions of risk (crashing and being apprehended by the police) were significant predictors of intentions to send and read texts over and above that provided by the TPB variables. The present research highlights the need for interventions to target attitudinal change and to increase risk perceptions in order to reduce the prevalence of these risky behaviours.",Article,1, Accident; Analysis and Prevention,,0,"

Behavioural response to illness: development and validation of a self-report measure of illness behaviour avoidance,"['Inês A. Trindade', 'Helena Pinto', 'Ana Allen Gomes[...]', 'Nuno Bravo Ferreira']","A robust scale capable of assessing illness-related experiential avoidance (EA) in any given medical condition is currency lacking. Further, there is no available measure that assesses EA related to illness behaviours, i.e., actions and/or reactions in relation to feeling unwell that have the purpose of defining one’s state of health and obtaining physical or emotional relief from perceived or actual illness. This study intends to fill this significant gap by presenting the development and psychometric test of a measure of EA related to illness behaviour, the Illness Behaviour Avoidance Scale (IBAS). A total of 370 Portuguese adults with chronic illness participated in the study. The structure and validity of the IBAS was tested through an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA; n = 185), a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA; n = 185), and reliability analyses. The IBAS presented a 7-item unifactorial structure, with good global (CMIN/DF = 2.08; CFI = 0.97; TLI = 0.94; SRMR = 0.04; RMSEA = 0.08, p = 0.139) and local adjustments (SRWs 0.56–0.73; SMCs 0.31–0.53). It also presented a good internal consistency (with αs = 0.82), and construct and discriminant validity. The IBAS appears to be a significant improvement from the use of previous EA measures in illness contexts. This scale can provide a measurement of whether the behavioural response to any given condition is a manifestation of EA.",Article,1, Current Psychology,Aug 22,1,"

Validation of the greek version of the body image-acceptance and action questionnaire,"['Maria Karekla', 'Evangelia Z. Mavraki', 'Patrisia Nikolaou', 'Maria Koushiou']","The present study aimed to examine the psychometric properties and factorial structure of the Greek version of the Body Image-Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (BI-AAQ). The BI-AAQ assesses cognitive flexibility and acceptance relative to body image. Two samples: an all female middle and high school sample (N = 85; Age M = 17.97, SD = 2.74) and a college student sample (N = 240; Age M = 21.50; SD = 2.98) in Cyprus completed a set of self-reported eating-related questionnaires. Reliability analysis showed that the Greek BI-AAQ has high internal consistency and good item-total correlations. Principal Component Analysis (Sample 1) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (Sample 2) supported a one-factor solution, as in the case of the original BI-AAQ. Hierarchical multiple regression predicting eating disorder behaviors (as assessed by the EDE-Q) from Weight Concerns (WCS) and BI-AAQ scores after controlling for BMI, produced a significant model, which accounted for 67% of variance. The BI-AAQ remained a significant predictor of eating disorder behaviors after controlling for BMI and weight concerns scores. The Greek version of the BI-AAQ questionnaire is thus a robust and reliable instrument. It adds to previous knowledge and research on the role of psychological flexibility and acceptance of body image in eating disorder behaviours and psychological difficulties.",Article,0, The European Journal of Counselling Psychology,,1,"

The effectiveness of mass media campaigns in increasing the use of seat belts: A systematic review,"['Maryam Akbari', 'Kamran B Lankarani', 'Reza Tabrizi[...]', 'Mark J M Sullman']","Objective This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the effectiveness of mass media campaigns for increasing the use of seat belts among drivers and front seat passengers. Methods We systematically searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science (WOS), and Scopus databases from November 1974 until June 2020 to identify before-after studies investigating the effect of mass media campaigns on seat belt use. The quality of all included studies was assessed using the National Institute of Health (NIH) tool. Chi-Squared tests and the I² statistic were used to evaluate inter-study heterogeneity, while the odds ratio (OR) was used as a measure of effect size. Results Of the 793 records initially identified, twenty articles were found to be appropriate for the current meta-analysis. Of these, 13, 5, and 2 studies were rated as good, fair, and poor quality, respectively. The meta-analysis finding using random effects model showed that mass media campaigns resulted in statistically significant increases in seat belt usage among drivers (OR= 1.40, 95% CI: 1.18- 1.68) and front seat passengers (OR= 1.54, 95% CI: 1.31- 1.82). Due to the presence of heterogeneity (I²: 99.7% for drivers; I²: 99.1% for front passengers), additional analyses were also undertaken. Sensitivity analyses showed that the pooled ORs remained consistent after removing each study one by one. Statistically significant increases in seat belt use among drivers were found in mass media campaigns which: had measurement periods longer than 12 months, were used in combination with enforcement activities, were published after 2000, and had good quality scores.

The economies of small states tend to be particularly dependent on open borders and the free movement of people: either in the form of tourists or because of mobile workers. The crisis disrupted established patterns in both of these spheres. At the same time, small states also benefitted from advantages. Small size tends to be related to higher social cohesion, flexible crisis management and easier tracking of infection chains. Despite the diversity of small states, their situation in the 'Corona crisis' is expected to differ from that of larger states.

European Clinical Neuropsychology: Role in Healthcare and Access to Neuropsychological Services,"['Erich Kasten', 'Fernando Barbosa', 'Mary Kosmidis[...]', 'Erik Hessen']","This study analyzed aspects of the work of clinical neuropsychologists across Europe. There are no published comparisons between European countries regarding the nature of clinical neuropsychologists’ work. Forty-one national psychological and neuropsychological societies were approached, of which 31 (76%) responded. Data from seven countries with less than 10 neuropsychologists were excluded. A license is required to practice clinical neuropsychology in 50% of the countries. Clinical neuropsychologists work independently in 62.5%. Diagnostic/assessment work is the most frequently reported activity (54%). Most neuropsychologists work in public hospitals, followed by health centers. Adult neuropsychology was the most frequent area of activity. Services in public institutions are covered by public entities (45.8%), or by a combination of patient funds and public entities (29.2%) and only 4.2% by the patient; whereas services in private institutions are covered by the patient (26.1%) and the combination of patient, public entities (21.7%) or patient and private entities (17.4%). The data suggest that the number of neuropsychologists working across European countries is considerably low in comparison to other medical professionals. The results of the survey identified similar aspects of neuropsychologists’ work, despite variations in terms of reimbursement and mechanisms, reflecting economic and healthcare differences. Estimates on the number of clinical neuropsychologists suggest insufficient access to neuropsychological services.",Article,1, Healthcare,,1,"

Four hundred and eighteen Greek-speaking students from one representative public middle school in Cyprus (43.90% males and 56.10% females; Mage = 13.71, SD = 1.00) were screened for ED pathology using the Eating Attitudes Questionnaire-26 (EAT-26) and completed the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE) and the Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth (AFQ-Y8). Screening was part of a school-wide psychoeducational Campaign titled “Love Your Body-Young Teens”, which aimed to raise awareness on healthy body image and EDs within the school community. Correlations and bootstrapping mediation analyses were conducted to evaluate the relations between ED pathology, self-esteem, and psychological inflexibility. Mediation analyses results showed that psychological inflexibility partly mediates the relationship between self-esteem and ED pathology. These preliminary findings highlight the contributions of both the individual’s negative internal events and their meta-response to these events in the development of EDs.

How SARS-CoV-2 might affect potassium balance via impairing epithelial sodium channels?,"['Maryam Noori', 'Seyed Aria Nejadghaderi', 'Mark J M Sullman[...]', 'Saeid Safiri']","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Electrolyte disorders particularly potassium abnormalities have been repeatedly reported as common clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Here, we discuss how SARS-CoV-2 may affect potassium balance by impairing the activity of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). The first hypothesis could justify the incidence of hypokalemia. SARS-CoV-2 cell entry through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may enhance the activity of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) classical axis and further leading to over production of aldosterone. Aldosterone is capable of enhancing the activity of ENaC and resulting in potassium loss from epithelial cells. However, type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) is able to inhibit the ENaC, but it is utilized in the case of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, therefore the ENaC remains activated. The second hypothesis describe the incidence of hyperkalemia based on the key role of furin. Furin is necessary for cleaving both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ENaC subunits. While the furin is hijacked by the virus, the decreased activity of ENaC would be expected, which causes retention of potassium ions and hyperkalemia. Given that the occurrence of hypokalemia is higher than hyperkalemia in COVID-19 patients, the first hypothesis may have greater impact on potassium levels. Further investigations are warranted to determine the exact role of ENaC in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.",Literature Review,1, Molecular Biology Reports,Aug 17,1,"

Understanding performance anxiety in the adolescent musician,['Ioulia Papageorgi'],"Research in musical performance anxiety so far has mainly focused on adult professional musicians. Additionally, studies have mostly maintained a `clinical approach' to musical performance anxiety, focusing on the diagnosis, assessment and treatment of maladaptive performance anxiety and its effects on selected groups of musicians. The aim of this thesis was to fill some of these gaps by exploring the experience of musical performance anxiety from the perspective of adolescent musicians. 410 students aged 12-19, all attending junior conservatoires and / or youth orchestras in the UK and Cyprus, responded to a self-report questionnaire. The questionnaire dealt with a range of learning and performance issues and yielded both quantitative and qualitative data. Performance anxiety was measured with the Adolescent Musicians' Performance Anxiety Scale (AMPAS), designed specifically for the needs of this study. Results revealed that performance anxiety was an issue for a significant percentage of students. Differences in performance anxiety level intensity were related to nationality and gender, but not to age. Susceptibility to experiencing performance anxiety, task efficacy and quality of performance environment were important factors in determining the intensity of experienced performance anxiety. Performance anxiety was found to be a multi-faceted construct, influenced by a variety of factors relating to self-perceptions, situational parameters, identity and culture, and family environment. Student attainment was influenced by performance anxiety. Achievement of higher Grades was related to the experience of higher levels of performance anxiety and perceptions of receiving positive feedback were

Aggressive driving is recognized as being a substantial contributor to motor vehicle crashes and is ranked as one of the leading concerns for motorists. Estimates show that drivers, when aggressive, have 35 times the odds of crashing than when not aggressive. Nevertheless, aggressive driving receives less research attention than other driver behaviors, such as distraction or impaired driving, despite having comparable or higher odds of crash involvement. This is likely to be due to a number of different reasons, including a confusion between anger and aggression, inconsistent definitions for aggressive driving, and uncertainty over whether road rage forms a part of aggressive driving.",Article,,,May 21,0,"

The Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youths AFQ-Y8 Validation in Greek-speaking adolescents,"['Vasilis S. Vasiliou', 'Maria Koushiou', 'Maria Karekla', 'Anthi Loutsiou']","The current study evaluates whether the Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth (AFQ-Y8) is suitable for measuring psychological inflexibility in Greek speaking adolescents (N=1019). Based on previous underlying theory of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), the initial 50-item scale of AFQ converged into a short 8-item scale for youth (Greco, Lambert, & Baer 2008). The short version of the AFQ questionnaire (AFQ-Y8) was used. The AFQ was adapted in Greek and administered to high school students (mean age=14.79, SD=1.058) in the context of two larger studies from which results were merged to examine the questionnaires’ psychometric properties. An exploratory factor analysis with principal components extraction and an oblique rotation revealed a single factor accounting for 43.08% of the variability. A reliability analysis showed a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of .81 for the factor. The next step was to ensure that the AFQ-Y8 is correlated with theoretically expected outcomes (concurrent and predictive validity), thus, results will be presented as an explanation for its predictive and convergent validity testing the AFQ-Y8 with related and unrelated measures. Based on the results, AFQ-Y8 appears to have adequate internal consistency in the Greek speaking population. In conclusion, the Greek AFQ-Y8 is a useful tool in evaluating psychological inflexibility and for group-based research in adolescents. Theoretical and clinical implications will be discussed.",Poster,,,,0,"

ARISTOTLE'S VISION OF POLITICAL EUDAIMONIA QUA THE DIVINE IN ETHICA NIKOMACHEA,['Pavlos E Michaelides'],"This paper firstly explores Aristotle's moral vision of eudaimonia or 'happiness' in Ethica Nichomachea (EN). The ensuing discussion points out that the life of excellence (arête) in all classical Greek philosophy culminates in the attainment of eudemonic being, equivocating likeness to the divine to the highest possible degree. The paper goes on to disclose significant differences concerning happiness between the moral and political philosophy of Aristotle and that of his predecessors, Socrates, and Plato. In turn, the present inquiry explores Aristotle's claim in EN that the education of a sufficient number of citizens of superior refinement best accomplishes human flourishing in both the private and public spheres. According to Aristotle, the paramount achievement of eudaimonia in individuals and the city-state happens through the moral and intellectual education of citizens of refinement in political science (politike episteme). Consequently, the present exploration carefully investigates the crux of Aristotle's vision of educating citizens of quality as this aspect of his ethics best illumines the holistic aim scope and curriculum of his proposed study in politike episteme (the science integrating all sciences). Finally, the present endeavor explores the superiority that Aristotle allots to contemplative or divine theoria in the latter part of his ethical treatise (Book X.7-8), where, he establishes a hierarchy between phrõnesis (practical wisdom) and theoria (contemplative wisdom), ascertaining the higher standing of the latter, a claim that inevitably leads him into paradox. Nevertheless, he also considers that perhaps contemplative wisdom surpasses divine reason, therefore, any form of duality between 'lower' an

The impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on individuals with gastrointestinal disorders: A protocol of an international collaborative study,"['Nuno Bravo Ferreira', 'Antonina A Mikocka-Walus', 'Miranda A L Van Tilburg[...]', 'Simon R. Knowles']","Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health across the globe. People living with a chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorder might be particularly at risk of mental health complications given higher rates of comorbid anxiety and depression compared to the healthy population. As GI disorders affect up to 40% of the population worldwide, this international collaborative study seeks to evaluate the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on GI symptoms specifically and more generally on the well-being of those living with chronic GI conditions. Methods: A longitudinal survey with three time points (baseline, 6-month, and 12-month) will be conducted online. Adult participants with GI disorders from multiple countries will be recruited via patient associations, social media advertising, utilizing snowball sampling. Participants will be invited to complete a battery of questionnaires including demographic and health parameters, and measures of gastrointestinal symptoms, fear of COVID-19, perceived impact of COVID-19, illness perceptions, coping, depression, anxiety, stress, catastrophizing, and quality of life, using validated measures where available. Statistical analyses will include univariate descriptive models, multivariate models utilizing regression, mediation, and moderation, and latent growth models. Conclusions: This project may present novel information to the field of psychogastroenterology and may provide crucial information regarding the areas of impact for individuals with GI disorders during and following the pandemic. Further, this information can guide healthcare providers and patient associations on how to target support related to the pandemic mental he

"Burden of ischemic heart disease and its attributable risk factors in 204 countries and territories, 1990–2019","['Saeid Safiri', 'Nahid Karamzad', 'Kuljit Singh[...]', 'Ali-Asghar Kolahi']","Aims To report the prevalence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and its attributable risk factors in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019, by age, sex, and socio-demographic index (SDI). Methods and results Ischemic heart disease was defined as acute myocardial infarction (MI) and chronic IHD (angina; asymptomatic IHD following MI). Cause of death ensemble modelling was used to produce fatality estimates. The prevalence of the non-fatal sequalae of IHD was estimated using DisMod MR 2.1. All estimates were presented as counts and age-standardized rates per 100 000 population. In 2019, IHD accounted for 197.2 million (177.7–219.5) prevalent cases, 9.1 million (8.4–9.7) deaths, and 182.0 million (170.2–193.5) DALYs worldwide. There were decreases in the global age-standardized prevalence rates of IHD [−4.6% (−5.7, −3.6)], deaths [−30.8% (−34.8, −27.2)], and DALYs [−28.6% (−33.3, −24.2)] from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, the global prevalence and death rates of IHD were higher among males across all age groups, while the death rate peaked in the oldest group for both sexes. A negative association was found between the age-standardized DALY rates and SDI. Globally, high systolic blood pressure (54.6%), high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (46.6%), and smoking (23.9%) were the three largest contributors to the DALYs attributable to IHD. Conclusion Although the global age-standardized prevalence, death, and DALY rates all decreased. Prevention and control programmes should be implemented to reduce population exposure to risk factors, reduce the risk of IHD in high-risk populations, and provide appropriate care for communities.",Article,1, European Journal of Preventive Cardiology,7d ago,0,"

The LIFEwithIBD Intervention: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial of a Face-to-Face Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Compassion-Based Intervention Tailored to People With Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"['Inês A. Trindade', 'Joana Pereira', 'Ana Galhardo[...]', 'Cláudia Ferreira']","Background: There is ample evidence of the high mental health burden caused by Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Several constructs such as experiential avoidance, cognitive fusion, shame, and self-criticism have recently emerged as potential intervention targets to improve mental health in IBD. Psychotherapeutic models such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and compassion-based interventions are known to target these constructs. In this protocol, we aim to describe a two-arm Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) testing the efficacy of an ACT and compassion-focused intervention named Living with Intention, Fullness, and Engagement with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (LIFEwithIBD) intervention + Treatment As Usual (TAU) vs. TAU in improving psychological distress, quality of life, work and social functioning, IBD symptom perception, illness-related shame, psychological flexibility, self-compassion, disease activity, inflammation biomarkers, and gut microbiota diversity. Methods: This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03840707, date assigned 13/02/2019). The LIFEwithIBD intervention is an adaptation to the IBD population of the Mind programme for people with cancer, an acceptance, mindfulness, and compassion-based intervention designed to be delivered in a group format.

Innovative Strategies and Challenges for the Prevention of Pathological Anxiety in Children and Adolescents,"['Ioannis Syros', 'Aggeliki Karantzali', 'Xenia Anastassiou-Hadjicharalambous']","The effects of pathological anxiety on public health have led to the realization that anxious children might experience significant limitations in their lives. Evidence-based cognitive-behavioral (CB) interventions are now being implemented in schools at a group level to combat anxiety.Childhood emotional health should be considered a national and global priority for an effective strategy promoting the prevention of mental health. The aim of this study is the description of novel data on the effectiveness of preventive interventions for anxious children, as well as the study of selective parameters that appear to affect treatment outcome.Furthermore, a brief review is cited regarding two empirically supported interventions, which include the Friends and Pyramid Club program and the Super Skills for Life program. Schools are considered suitable places for all types of prevention programs; they provide a familiar environment to a child, and by providing access to the prevention programs to many children, school programs could be the ideal way for anxious young individuals to practice and generalize their skills. Schools also offer an ideal space for collaboration between teachers and mental health professionals. Most programs have been effective in reducing anxiety, especially those based on the principles of CB, where the effects appear to be independent of the professional status of the leader (trained teacher or mental health professional). Friends and Pyramid Club interventions are well-established, multifaceted, and cost-effective programs, which include combinations of techniques (mostly behavioral activation, cognitive preparation, teaching social skills, and relaxation techniques).

"Epidemiology, prognosis and management of potassium disorders in Covid‐19","['Maryam Noori', 'Seyed Aria Nejadghaderi', 'Mark J M Sullman[...]', 'Saeid Safiri']","Coronavirus disease (Covid-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is currently the largest health crisis facing most countries. Several factors have been linked with a poor prognosis for this disease, including demographic factors, pre-existing comorbidities and laboratory parameters such as white blood cell count, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine and electrolytes. Electrolyte abnormalities particularly potassium disorders are common among Covid-19 patients. Based on our pooled analysis, hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur in 24.3% and 4.15% of Covid-19 patients, respectively. Potassium level deviation from the normal range may increase the chances of unfavorable outcomes and even death. Therefore, this article reviewed the epidemiology of potassium disorders and explained how hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are capable of deteriorating cardiac outcomes and the prognosis of Covid-19 for infected patients.

"I will not comply because it is a hoax: Conspiracy beliefs, lockdown compliance, and the importance of psychological flexibility","['Marios Constantinou', 'Maria Karekla', 'Andrew T Gloster']","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented situations (government lockdowns, quarantines, etc.) and stressors (a seemingly “phantom” virus that can be lurking anywhere) causing uncertainty for the future, uncontrollable and unpredictable situations. It appears that especially during times of uncertainty and high stress, conspiracy theories flourish and these can affect the way individuals behave, especially in response to governmental recommendations for social isolation and quarantine. Psychological flexibility, we hypothesized, may act as a protective factor in the relation between COVID-19 distress, conspiracy theory beliefs and consequent behaving. In this respect, the aim of this paper was to examine how conspiracy theory beliefs, COVID-19 distress, adherence behavior, and psychological flexibility interact. Participants were 1001 individuals (802 women; Mage=35.59years, SD= 10.07), who completed an online survey approximately one month after the first governmental measures of self-isolation and quarantine were enforced. Psychological flexibility was found to mediate the relation between conspiracy theory beliefs and compliance behavior. Further, being highly stressed appeared to increase the probability that a person will believe conspiracy theories, while such beliefs influenced whether a person would follow public health recommendations. Psychological flexibility appeared to be a protective factor at low and moderate distress levels. However, at high levels of COVID-19 distress, individuals prone to conspiracy theory beliefs would be less likely to conform to governmental public health recommendations irrespective of their psychological flexibility levels.",Article,1, Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science,,0,"

Psychosocial factors associated with the self- reported frequency of cell phone use while driving in Iran,"['Amir Hossein Kalantari', 'Seyedeh Monavar Yazdi', 'Tetiana Hill[...]', 'Mark J M Sullman']","Cell phone use while driving is a common contributing factor in thousands of road traffic injuries every year globally. Despite extensive research investigating the risks associated with cell phone use while driving, social media campaigns to raise public awareness and a number of laws banning phone use while driving, this behaviour remains prevalent throughout the world. The current study was conducted in Iran, where road traffic injuries are the leading causes of death and disability, and where drivers continue to use their cell phones, despite legislative bans restricting this behaviour. A total of 255 drivers in the city of Mashhad (male = 66.3%; mean age = 30.73 years; SD = 9.89) completed either an online or a paper-based survey assessing the self-reported frequency of using a cell phone while driving. Psychosocial factors contributing to cell phone use while driving and support for legislation restricting this behaviour, as well as the Big Five personality traits, were also measured. Overall, the results showed that almost 93% of drivers use their cell phones while driving at least once a week, with 32.5% reporting they always use their cell phones while driving. Ordinal logistic regression revealed that the presence of a child passenger, age, perceived benefits and risks of using cell phones while driving, as well as the perceived ability to drive safely while using a cell phone, were strongly associated with the frequency of cell phone use while driving. As for personality traits-extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness significantly predicted the frequency of cell phone use in this sample of Iranian drivers.",Article,1, PLoS ONE,,1,"

Lack of social support, psychiatric history, childhood trauma, additional stressful events in the past month, and low resilience predicted more mental health problems for COVID-19 and other stressful events. Higher COVID-19 country impact was associated with increased mental health impact of both COVID-19 and other stressful events. Analysis of differences across geographic regions revealed that in Latin America more mental health symptoms were reported for COVID-19 related events versus other stressful events, while the opposite pattern was seen in North America.Conclusions: The mental health impact of COVID-19-related stressors covers a wide range of symptoms and is more sever

Cross-cultural research,['Menelaos Apostolou'],"The current chapter aims to assess the importance of cross-cultural research for the field of evolutionary psychology. The disciple of evolutionary psychology is based on the premise that human behavior is generated by a collection of brain modules or adaptations that have evolved to produce fitness-increasing outcomes in the ancestral environment. Thus, understanding human behavior requires understanding the nature and function of these adaptations, which in turn, requires reconstructing the ancestral human condition. By identifying the typical patterns of life in contemporary pre-industrial societies, cross-cultural anthropological research constitutes a valid way to reconstruct the way of life of ancestral pre-industrial societies. Moreover, cross-cultural historical research could be used to reconstruct the way of life in the later period of human evolution. Furthermore, evolutionary psychology is based on the premise that adaptations are universal: Behavior arises from evolved mechanisms that most humans share. Thus, many evolutionary hypotheses require cross-cultural research in order to be tested. Finally, in the evolutionary psychological perspective, behavioral adaptations are not rigid mechanisms, but are responsive to environmental conditions. Accordingly, cross-cultural research is necessary for understanding the range of behaviors that these mechanisms can produce in different settings.",Chapter,,,May 7,0,"

In order to protect themselves from the costs of cheating, people need first to detect infidelity, and for this purpose, they employ specific infidelity-detection strategies. By using a combination of qualitative research methods, we identified 47 acts that people perform in order to detect their partners’ infidelity. Using quantitative methods, we classified these acts into six broader strategies for detecting infidelity. Participants indicated that they were more likely to employ the “Observe changes in her/his behavior,” followed by the “Ask and observe her/his reactions,” and the “Check where she/he is” strategies. Almost 58% of the participants indicated that they would use three or more strategies in order to detect their partners’ infidelity. We also found that higher scorers in Machiavellianism and psychopathy were more likely to employ the identified strategies than lower scorers. In addition, sex and age effects were found for most strategies.",Article,1, Evolutionary Psychological Science,May 19,0,"

The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially affected many groups within the general population, but particularly those with extant clinical conditions, such as having or being treated for cancer. Cancer patients are at a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 since the malignancy and chemotherapy may negatively affect the immune system, and their immunocompromised condition also increases the risk of infection. Substantial international efforts are currently underway to develop specific methods for diagnosing and treating COVID-19.

Electrolyte disturbances are common complications of COVID-19. The present article examined the potential mechanisms of hypokalemia and hyperkalemia in patients suffering from COVID-19, in order to raise awareness of potassium disorders in SARS-CoV-2 infections. PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched with keywords, such as ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""2019-nCoV"", ""Hypokalemia"", ""Hyperkalemia"", ""Serum potassium"", and ""Etiology"", ""Pathophysiology"" up to April 20, 2021 without any search filters. We included articles that proposed potential mechanisms for potassium abnormalities in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we used backward and forward citation searching. Potassium abnormalities are considered to be important electrolyte disturbances, with reported incidences ranging from < 5% to > 50% in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, understanding the etiologies of potassium abnormalities could help to improve disease outcome. Utilization of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 in the renal cells, viral-induced tubular injury, and gastrointestinal abnormalities, such as anorexia, diarrhea, and vomiting may predispose COVID-19 patients to developing hypokalemia. Furthermore, depleted magnesium levels make hypokalemia refractory to treatments. In addition, hyperkalemia may occur because of reduced urinary output, as a consequence of renal failure. Changes in blood pH and medication-induced side-effects are other possible reasons for the deviation of potassium levels from the normal range.

Methods: In total, 957 participants completed an online survey during the first lockdown, 134 of whom completed a similar survey again during the second lockdown. The outcomes assessed included stress, positive and negative affect, and well-being. Results: The results indicated no population-wide severe reactions in the participants. Repeated measures analyses showed similar mental health levels during both the first and the second lockdowns. Further inspection of participants’ scores indicated that, for all mental health variables, approximately half of the participants improved, while the other half deteriorated. Discussion: Perceived social support and psychological flexibility predicted most psychological outcomes during both lockdowns.

The role of social connection on the experience of COVID-19 related post-traumatic growth and stress,"['Marcela Matos', 'Kirsten Mcewan', 'Martin Kanovsky[...]', 'Paul Gilbert']","Background Historically social connection has been an important way through which humans have coped with large-scale threatening events. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns have deprived people of major sources of social support and coping, with others representing threats. Hence, a major stressor during the pandemic has been a sense of social disconnection and loneliness. This study explores how people’s experience of compassion and feeling socially safe and connected, in contrast to feeling socially disconnected, lonely and fearful of compassion, effects the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on post-traumatic growth and post-traumatic stress. Methods Adult participants from the general population ( N = 4057) across 21 countries worldwide, completed self-report measures of social connection (compassion for self, from others, for others; social safeness), social disconnection (fears of compassion for self, from others, for others; loneliness), perceived threat of COVID-19, post-traumatic growth and traumatic stress. Results Perceived threat of COVID-19 predicted increased post-traumatic growth and traumatic stress. Social connection (compassion and social safeness) predicted higher post-traumatic growth and traumatic stress, whereas social disconnection (fears of compassion and loneliness) predicted increased traumatic symptoms only. Social connection heightened the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on post-traumatic growth, while social disconnection weakened this impact. Social disconnection magnified the impact of the perceived threat of COVID-19 on traumatic stress. These effects were consistent across all countries.

Mental healthcare for healthcare workers (HCWs) should receive serious consideration. This study served to determine the mental-health outcomes of 1,556 HCWs from 45 countries who participated in the COVID-19 IMPACT project, and to examine the predictors of the outcomes during the first pandemic wave. Methods: Outcomes assessed were self-reported perceived stress, depression symptom, and sleep changes. The predictors examined included sociodemographic factors and perceived social support. Results: The results demonstrated that half of the HCWs had moderate levels of perceived stress and symptoms of depression. Half of the HCWs ( n = 800, 51.4%) had similar sleeping patterns since the pandemic started, and one in four slept more or slept less. HCWs reported less perceived stress and depression symptoms and higher levels of perceived social support than the general population who participated in the same project. Predictors associated with higher perceived stress and symptoms of depression among HCWs included female sex, not having children, living with parents, lower educational level, and lower social support. Discussion: The need for establishing ways to mitigate mental-health risks and adjusting psychological interventions and support for HCWs seems to be significant as the pandemic continues.",Article,1, Swiss Journal of Psychology,,0,"

Furthermore, 264 participants from 30 different countries reported being cancer patients. The median age was 51.5 years, 79.9% were female, and 28% had breast cancer. Cancer participants reported higher self-efficacy to follow recommended national guidelines regarding COVID-19 protective behaviors compared to non-cancer participants (p < 0.01). They were less stressed (p < 0.01), more psychologically flexible (p < 0.01), and had higher levels of positive affect compared to non-cancer participants. Amongst cancer participants, the majority (80.3%) reported COVID-19, not their cancer, as their priority during the first wave of the pandemic and females reported higher levels of stress compared to males.

Primary and secondary psychopathic traits: The role of attachment and cognitive emotion regulation strategies,"['Melina Nicole Kyranides', 'Louiza Neofytou']","Insecure attachment has been linked with psychopathic traits however, the precise relationship between the avoidance and anxiety attachment dimensions and primary and secondary psychopathic traits needs further research. Furthermore, the use of cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS) in individuals with psycho-pathic traits has been increasing, however, little is known about the unique association of adaptive and mal-adaptive CERS in relation to primary and secondary psychopathic traits. This study aimed to explore the relationship between adult insecure attachment dimensions and CERS with both primary and secondary traits in a non-clinical sample of 338 adults ranging between 18 and 70 years of age (231 of which were females). Findings indicated that having an avoidant attachment, blaming others and positively reappraising situations contributed to the prediction of primary psychopathic traits, while putting into perspective was identified as a protective factor. In contrast, having an anxious attachment and catastrophizing arose as risk factors for secondary psychopathic traits. Findings highlight the need to evaluate psychopathic variants as heterogeneous constructs, as both attachment dimensions and CERS uniquely relate to primary and secondary psychopathic traits.",Article,1, Personality and Individual Differences,Oct 1,0,"

A systematic literature review of observational studies of the bilateral association between diabetes and migraine,"['Marjan Hosseinpour', 'Farzad Maleki', 'Maliheh Khoramdad[...]', 'Saeid Safiri']","Background and aim To conduct a systematic literature review and synthesize data from all epidemiological studies investigating the association between diabetes and migraine in adults. Method and material Electronic databases, including Web of Science, PubMed and Scopus in addition to Google Scholar search engine were systematically searched up to Jun 2020 to identify studies reporting the diabetes-migraine association. Results A total of 15 studies were selected which were published from 2012 to 2019. Five out of 15 studies assessed the presence of migraine in diabetic subjects, while nine studies assessed the presence of diabetes in migraine subjects. The cohort study reported a hazard ratio for diabetes of 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91–1.24) for women with migraine with aura, 1.01 (95% CI: 0.89–1.16) for women without aura, and 1.13 (95% CI: 0.98–1.3) for women with a migraine history, compared with women with no history of migraine. Due to the high degree of heterogeneity, and the lack of statistical estimates of the association in several of the reviewed studies, meta-analysis of the available data was not possible. Conclusion This study is the first review to examine the association between diabetes and migraine. Further longitudinal studies are required to clarify the migraine-diabetes association. There is also a clear need for more studies with larger sample sizes and similar methodologies in order to provide necessary information to conduct a meta-analysis.",Literature Review,1, Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome Clinical Research and Reviews,,0,"

Mobile phone applications use while driving in Ukraine: Self-reported frequencies and psychosocial factors underpinning this risky behaviour,"['Tetiana Hill', 'Amanda Stephens', 'Mark J M Sullman']","Despite the fact that mobile phones have been transformed over the last decade into information and communication hubs that are fundamental to modern life, there is little information on how this has impacted on mobile phone use while driving. The present study was conducted in Ukraine, where this risky behaviour remains a common driving practice, despite legislative bans. A total of 220 (male = 82%; mean age = 35.53; SD = 10.54) drivers completed an online survey assessing frequency of engaging in a range of mobile phone applications while driving. Four variables of the theory of planned behaviour (general attitude and intention towards phone use while driving, social norms towards mobile phone use, perceived behavioural control, the specific beliefs about being able to engage in distracting activities and drive safely), and type A behaviour pattern were also collected. The results showed that, during the last year, 65% of drivers had read a text message and 49% had written a text using mobile phone applications. Likewise, a substantial proportion of the sample reported using social media while driving, by checking (34%), sending or typing a post (25%) on social network applications. Hierarchical stepwise regressions showed that a positive attitude towards mobile phone use while driving and beliefs about being able to drive safely and write or read a text message were significantly associated with the mobile phone applications use while driving. No associations were found between the type A behaviour pattern and mobile phone applications use.",Article,1, PLoS ONE,Feb 18,1,"

Is driver education contributing towards road safety? a systematic review of systematic reviews,"['Maryam Akbari', 'Kamran B Lankarani', 'Seyed Taghi Heydari[...]', 'Mark J M Sullman']","Background: There is a vast amount of literature on the effects of driver education. However, the evidence has become somewhat fragmented, making it challenging to understand driver education's effectiveness for improving road safety. The current study aimed to provide the efficacy of pre-LDE and post-LDE interventions aimed at improving the safety of drivers (includes crashes, injuries, or secondary outcomes). Methods: The following online databases were searched up to the 21st of February 2020: Web of Science (WOS), Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane library, and other relevant databases. Systematic reviews (SR) and meta-analyses were selected to investigate the efficacy of driving education in reducing crashes, injuries, or secondary outcomes. Two investigators independently conducted the data extraction and used the assessment of multiple systematic reviews (AMSTAR) tool to conduct a quality assessment of each SR identified. Results: Out of the 229 potential articles, seven SRs were eligible for the current overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This overview showed that pre-and post-license education by people of all ages led to improvements in secondary outcomes, such as performance, self-perceived driving abilities, behind-the-wheel driving performance, and even a small decrease in traffic offenses. However, education was not effective in reducing crashes or injuries, either at the individual or community level. Conclusions: There was no evidence that driver education is an effective approach to reducing crashes or injuries. This negative result might be due to ineffective teaching methods. To improve road safety, it appears necessary to change the method or content of driving education since th

Cardiac complications following mRNA COVID‐19 vaccines: A systematic review of case reports and case series,"['Asra Fazlollahi', 'Mahdi Zahmatyar', 'Maryam Noori[...]', 'Saeid Safiri']","There have been several local and systemic adverse events associated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Pericarditis, myocarditis and myocardial infarction are examples of cardiac complications related to these vaccines. In this article, we conducted a systematic review of case reports and case series to identify the clinical profile, investigations, and management of reported cardiac complications post-mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, as well as the medRxiv preprint server, with terms including: ‘SARS-CoV-2’, ‘COVID-19’, ‘messenger RNA vaccine*’, ‘mRNA-1273 vaccine’, ‘BNT162 vaccine’, ‘myocarditis’, ‘pericarditis’, ‘stroke’ and ‘Myocardial Ischemia’ up to 25 September 2021. Studies were excluded if they were not case reports or case series, or reported cases from non-mRNA vaccines. Case reports and case series were included that investigated the potential cardiac complications associated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The JBI checklist was used to assess quality and data synthesis was conducted using a qualitative methodology called narrative synthesis. Sixty-nine studies, including 43 case reports and 26 case series, were included. Myocarditis/myopericarditis and pericarditis were the most common adverse events among the 243 reported cardiac complications, post mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Males with a median age of 21 years had the highest frequency of myocarditis. Almost three quarters (74.4%) of cases with myocarditis had received the BNT162b2 vaccine and 87.7% had received the second dose of the vaccine.

"Risk and protective factors, stressors, and symptoms of adjustment disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic – First results of the ESTSS COVID-19 pan-European ADJUST study","['Annett Lotzin', 'Linda Krause', 'Elena Acquarini[...]', 'Ingo Schäfer']","BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic exposes individuals to multiple stressors, such as quarantine, physical distancing, job loss, risk of infection, and loss of loved ones. Such a complex array of stressors potentially lead to symptoms of adjustment disorder. OBJECTIVE This cross-sectional exploratory study examined relationships between risk and protective factors, stressors, and symptoms of adjustment disorder during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Data from the first wave of the European Society of Traumatic Stress Studies (ESTSS) longitudinal ADJUST Study were used. N = 15,563 participants aged 18 years and above were recruited in eleven countries (Austria, Croatia, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Sweden) from June to November 2020. Associations between risk and protective factors (e.g. gender, diagnosis of a mental health disorder), stressors (e.g. fear of infection, restricted face-to-face contact), and symptoms of adjustment disorder (ADNM-8) were examined using multivariate linear regression. RESULTS The prevalence of self-reported probable adjustment disorder was 18.2%. Risk factors associated with higher levels of symptoms of adjustment disorder were female gender, older age, being at risk for severe COVID-19 illness, poorer general health status, current or previous trauma exposure, a current or previous mental health disorder, and longer exposure to COVID-19 news. Protective factors related to lower levels of symptoms of adjustment disorder were higher income, being retired, and having more face-to-face contact with loved ones or friends.

COVID‐19–related personal product shortages are associated with psychological distress in people living with gastrointestinal disorders: A cross‐sectional survey,"['Antonina A Mikocka-Walus', 'Dave Skvarc', 'Miranda A L Van Tilburg[...]', 'Simon Knowles']","Background The mental health response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic–related product shortages in those living with chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorders has received little attention. We aimed to explore the association between the pandemic-related product shortages and psychological distress in people with GI disorders. Methods This online cross-sectional survey was nested within an ongoing, international, prospective study of well-being in people with GI disorders. The study was advertised in multiple countries in May-September 2020 via patient organizations and social media. The primary outcome measure was distress, evaluated by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. We utilized linear regressions, adjusting for covariates and testing individual moderation effects. Key Results Overall, 831 people completed the survey from 27 countries, of whom 82% were female (mean age = 49 years). The most common disorders included inflammatory bowel disease (n = 322), celiac disease (n = 273), and irritable bowel syndrome (n = 260). Significant problems accessing food were reported by 19.8%, non-medical therapies by 16%, toilet paper by 10.8%, and essential medication by 8.9% of the sample (>5% pain medication). There was a positive association between toilet paper and pain medication shortages and distress, and a negative association between food shortages and distress. Significant moderation effects were identified for COVID-19 prevalence and toilet paper and food shortages, and between COVID-19 fear and pain medication shortages.

Facebook Intrusion as a Mediator Between Positive Capital and General Distress: A Cross-Cultural Study,"['Aneta Przepiorka', 'Agata Błachnio', 'Mark J M Sullman[...]', 'Sílvia Font-Mayolas']","Background: Social networking sites (SNSs) play an important role in many aspects of life nowadays, and it seems to be crucial to explore their impact on human well-being and functioning. The main aim of the study was to examine the mediating role of Facebook intrusion between positive capital and general distress. Positive capital was considered as comprising self-esteem, ego-resiliency, and self-control, while general distress was seen as having three dimensions: depression, anxiety, and stress. Methods: The sample consisted of N = 4,495 participants ( M = 22.96 years, SD = 5.46) from 14 countries: Australia, Cyprus, Greece, Hong Kong, Lithuania, New Zealand, Peru, Poland, Russia, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and United States. We used the following methods: the Facebook Intrusion Questionnaire (FIQ), the Self-Esteem Scale (SES), the Brief Self-Control Scale (SCS), The Ego Resiliency Revised Scale and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Results: We found that Facebook intrusion was a mediator between self-esteem and general distress and between self-control and general distress. Limitations: The present study was based on a cross-sectional study, and the measures used were self-report measures. The majority of the participants were recruited using convenience sampling. Conclusions: The present findings contribute to a better understanding on how the social media have impact on individual mental health.

The present study reports the global, regional and national burden of anemia and its underlying causes between 1990 and 2019, by age, sex and socio-demographic index (SDI). Methods Publicly available data on the point prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) were retrieved from the global burden of disease (GBD) 2019 study for 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2019. The point prevalence, YLD counts and rates per 100,000 population were presented, along with their corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals. Results In 2019, the global age-standardized point prevalence and YLD rates for anemia were 23,176.2 (22,943.5–23,418.6) and 672.4 (447.2–981.5) per 100,000 population, respectively. Moreover, the global age-standardized point prevalence and YLD rate decreased by 13.4% (12.1–14.5%) and 18.8% (16.9–20.8%), respectively, over the period 1990–2019. The highest national point prevalences of anemia were found in Zambia [49327.1 (95% UI: 46,838.5–51,700.1)], Mali [46890.1 (95% UI: 44,301.1–49,389.8)], and Burkina Faso [46117.2 (95% UI: 43,640.7–48,319.2)]. In 2019, the global point prevalence of anemia was highest in the 15–19 and 95+ age groups in females and males, respectively. Also, the burden of anemia was lower in regions with higher socio-economic development. Globally, most of the prevalent cases were attributable to dietary iron deficiency, as well as hemoglobinopathies and hemolytic anemias.

How People Become Attractive to Prospective Mates: Strategies of Self- Promotion in the Greek Cultural Context,"['Menelaos Apostolou', 'Yan Wang', 'Athina Gavriilidou']","An important aspect of human mating is to appeal to prospective mates. Accordingly, the current research attempted to identify the strategies that people use in order to become more attractive as prospective intimate partners. More specifically, using open-ended questionnaires in a sample of 326 Greek-speaking participants, we identified 87 acts that people performed in order to become more attractive as mates. By using quantitative research methods in a sample of 2,197 Greek-speaking participants, we classified these acts into 16 different strategies. We found that, enhancing one's looks and becoming more pleasant, were among the most preferred strategies. Women were more likely than men to adopt strategies that involved looks, while men were more likely than women to adopt strategies that involved resource acquisition capacity. Moreover, age effects were found for most strategies. The identified strategies were classified into two broader domains, one aiming to develop and demonstrate fitness-increasing qualities, and the other to deceive about fitness-impairing traits.",Article,1, Evolutionary Psychology,Oct 4,0,"

Convenience sampled online survey was conducted between April and June 2020 from 9130 citizens in 21 countries. Illness perceptions toward COVID-19, psychological flexibility, prosociality, coping and mental health, socio-demographics, lockdown-related variables and COVID-19 status were assessed. Results showed that psychological flexibility was the only significant mediator in the relationship between illness perceptions toward COVID-19 and mental health across all regions (all ps = 0.001–0.021). Seeking social support was the significant mediator across subgroups (all ps range = <0.001–0.005) except from the Hong Kong sample (p = 0.06) and the North and South American sample (p = 0.53). No mediation was found for problem-solving (except from the Northern European sample, p = 0.009). Prosociality was the significant mediator in the Hong Kong sample (p =0.016) and the Eastern European sample (p = 0.008).

Typologies of Adolescent Musicians and Experiences of Performance Anxiety Among Instrumental Learners,['Ioulia Papageorgi'],"Literature suggests that music performance anxiety (MPA) is prevalent in adolescence, a developmental period with increased likelihood of experiencing anxiety under evaluative conditions. Evidence also indicate that individuals may respond to evaluative situations in distinct ways. Factors contributing to the individuality of responses in evaluative situations (such as test taking and musical performance) are not yet fully understood. This study investigated student typologies in adolescent instrumental learners. Participants included 410 learners who completed the Young Musicians’ Performance Questionnaire. K-Means cluster analysis revealed three typologies: Cluster 1 – moderately anxious students evidencing lower levels of motivation and feeling ineffective but guarding their self-esteem; Cluster 2 – highly anxious students evidencing negative self-perceptions and being susceptible to experiencing maladaptive MPA; Cluster 3 – low anxious students evidencing high levels of motivation and confidence and inclined toward experiencing adaptive MPA. The 3-cluster solution effectiveness was validated with discriminant analysis. Significant associations between examination achievement and cluster membership revealed variations between clusters. Thematic analysis of qualitative data facilitated further understanding of their characteristics. This study adds to the body of MPA literature by exploring the different ways with which adolescent musicians interpret and respond to anxiety inducing situations.

Attitudes Toward Four Levels of Self-Driving Technology Among Elderly Drivers,"['Timo Lajunen', 'Mark J M Sullman']","Automatization and autonomous vehicles can drastically improve elderly drivers' safety and mobility, with lower costs to the driver and the environment. While autonomous vehicle technology is developing rapidly, much less attention and resources have been devoted to understanding the acceptance, attitudes, and preferences of vehicle automatization among driver groups, such as the elderly. In this study, 236 elderly drivers (≥65 years) evaluated four vehicles representing SAE levels 2–5 in terms of safety, trustworthiness, enjoyment, reliability, comfort, ease of use, and attractiveness, as well as reporting preferences for vehicles employing each of the four levels of automation. The results of a repeated-measures ANOVA showed that the elderly drivers rated the SAE level 2 vehicle highest and the fully automated vehicle (SAE 5) lowest across all attributes. The preference for the vehicle declined as a function of increasing automatization. The seven attributes formed an internally coherent “attitude to automatization” scale, a strong correlate of vehicle preference. Age or annual mileage were not related to attitudes or preferences for automated vehicles. The current study shows that elderly drivers' attitudes toward automatization should be studied further, and these results should be taken into account when developing automated vehicles. The full potential of automatization may not be realized if elderly drivers are ignored.",Article,1, Frontiers in Psychology,,1,"

Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health: An international study,"['Andrew T Gloster', 'Demetris Lamnisos', 'Jelena Lubenko[...]', 'Maria Karekla']","Background The COVID-19 pandemic triggered vast governmental lockdowns. The impact of these lockdowns on mental health is inadequately understood. On the one hand such drastic changes in daily routines could be detrimental to mental health. On the other hand, it might not be experienced negatively, especially because the entire population was affected. Methods The aim of this study was to determine mental health outcomes during pandemic induced lockdowns and to examine known predictors of mental health outcomes. We therefore surveyed n = 9,565 people from 78 countries and 18 languages. Outcomes assessed were stress, depression, affect, and wellbeing. Predictors included country, sociodemographic factors, lockdown characteristics, social factors, and psychological factors. Results Results indicated that on average about 10% of the sample was languishing from low levels of mental health and about 50% had only moderate mental health. Importantly, three consistent predictors of mental health emerged: social support, education level, and psychologically flexible (vs. rigid) responding. Poorer outcomes were most strongly predicted by a worsening of finances and not having access to basic supplies. Conclusions These results suggest that on whole, respondents were moderately mentally healthy at the time of a population-wide lockdown. The highest level of mental health difficulties were found in approximately 10% of the population. Findings suggest that public health initiatives should target people without social support and those whose finances worsen as a result of the lockdown.

"‘Educating for peace’: conflict, division and social work education in Cyprus","['Vasilios Ioakimidis', 'Gregory Neocleous', 'Agamemnonas Zachariades[...]', 'Buse Erzeybek']","Social work practice and training in the context of political and ethnic conflict has seen renewed interest among scholars. Recent research has tried to shift focus away from simplistic interpretations of social work as an unshakably ‘benevolent’ profession. A recent emphasis on social work’s colonial legacies and the structural causes of political violence provide us with important new directions on how to rethink and reshape social work education and practice in these contexts. Cyprus presents a very interesting, yet under-explored, case study as it remains an island de facto divided, along ethnic lines. The division has resulted in the physical and political separation of the two most populous ethnic communities (Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots). United Nations (UN)-sponsored peace talks have gained momentum in recent years. This paper offers the first systematic exploration of the views of social work students across both sides of the divide. Through a mixed-method approach, students were able to express their thoughts and beliefs on ‘the other’ and on social work in the post-conflict realities. The study confirms the contradictory nature of social work education in Cyprus challenges the futility of nationalism and argues for the importance of bi-communal social work partnerships.",Article,1, European Journal of Social Work,,0,"

This study aimed to translate, validate and test the factor structure of the Portuguese version of the CompACT and to conduct a measurement invariance analysis comparing the scale’s performance in Portuguese and UK samples. Results from an Exploratory Factor Analysis demonstrated that the Portuguese version of the CompACT statistically performed better without 5 items from the Openness to Experience subscale. The 18-item Portuguese-adapted CompACT presented significant correlations in the expected directions and with the expected magnitudes with AAQ-II, CFQ-7, MAAS, CAQ-8, and DASS-21. Partial metric invariance was demonstrated between the Portuguese-adapted 18-item CompACT and the original CompACT in a UK sample. The non-correspondence between responses to these versions may be due to differences between the Portuguese and British cultures. This study contributes with the adaptation of the original CompACT to the Portuguese language and with the refinement of this instrument to an 18-item measure of psychological flexibility, that appears to be adequate for use in Portuguese samples. The lack of complete metric invariance of the CompACT found across the Portuguese and UK samples highlights the importance of psychometrically analyzing psychological instruments before use in cultural contexts distinct from the one targeted in the measure’s original validation study.",Article,1, Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science,May 1,0,"

What makes It Difficult to keep an Intimate Relationship: Evidence From Greece and China,"['Menelaos Apostolou', 'Yan Wang']","Keeping an intimate relationship is challenging, and there are many factors causing strain. In the current research, we employed a sample of 1,403 participants from China and Greece who were in an intimate relationship, and we classified 78 difficulties in keeping an intimate relationship in 13 factors. Among the most common ones were clinginess, long work hours, and lack of personal time and space. Clinginess was reported as a more common source of relationship strain by women, while bad sex was reported as a more common source of relationship strain by men. Fading away enthusiasm, bad sex, infidelity and children were reported as more important by older participants, while lack of personal time and space, and character issues were reported as more important by younger participants. The factor structure was similar in the Greek and in the Chinese cultural contexts, but there were also differences. In addition, there were significant interactions between the sample and the sex. For instance, for the non-monogamous factor, men gave higher scores than women in both samples, but the difference was much more pronounced in the Greek sample.",Article,1, Evolutionary Psychology,,1,"

Burden of Transport-Related Injuries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region: A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017,"['GBD EMR Transport Injuries Collaborators', 'Saeid Safiri', 'Mark J M Sullman[...]', 'Mohsen Naghavi']","Background: Transport-related injuries (TIs) are a substantial public health concern for all regions of the world. The present study quantified the burden of TIs and deaths in the Eastern Mediterranean region (EMR) in 2017 by sex and age. Methods: TIs and deaths were estimated by age, sex, country, and year using Cause of Death Ensemble modelling (CODEm) and DisMod-MR 2.1. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), which quantify the total burden of years lost due to premature death or disability, were also estimated per 100000 population. All estimates were reported along with their corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). Results: In 2017, there were 5.5 million (UI 4.9-6.2) transport-related incident cases in the EMR - a substantial increase from 1990 (2.8 million; UI 2.5-3.1). The age-standardized incidence rate for the EMR in 2017 was 787 (UI 705.5-876.2) per 100000, which has not changed significantly since 1990 (-0.9%; UI -4.7 to 3). These rates differed remarkably between countries, such that Oman (1303.9; UI 1167.3-1441.5) and Palestine (486.5; UI 434.5-545.9) had the highest and lowest age-standardized incidence rates per 100000, respectively. In 2017, there were 185.3 thousand (UI 170.8-200.6) transport-related fatalities in the EMR - a substantial increase since 1990 (140.4 thousand; UI 118.7-156.9). The age-standardized death rate for the EMR in 2017 was 29.5 (UI 27.1-31.9) per 100000, which was 30.5% lower than that found in 1990 (42.5; UI 36.8-47.3). In 2017, Somalia (54; UI 30-77.4) and Lebanon (7.1; UI 4.8-8.6) had the highest and lowest age-standardized death rates per 100,000, respectively. The age-standardised DALY rate for the EMR in 2017 was 1,528.8 (UI 1412.5-1651.3) per 100000, which was 34.4% lower

"Involuntary singlehood and its causes: The effects of flirting capacity, mating effort, choosiness and capacity to perceive signals of interest",['Menelaos Apostolou'],"A considerable proportion of the population is involuntarily single; that is, they want to be in an intimate relationship but they face difficulties in doing so. The current paper attempted to assess some possible predictors of this phenomenon. More specifically, in a sample of 1228 Greek-speaking women and men, we found that participants who scored low in flirting capacity, capacity to perceive signals of interest and mating effort, were more likely to be involuntarily single than in an intimate relationship, and experienced longer spells of single-hood. Mating effort had also a significant effect on voluntary singlehood, with low scorers being more likely to be in this category than high scorers. Choosiness had also a significant effect, but only on voluntary singlehood, with high scorers being more likely to prefer to be single than low scorers.",Article,1, Personality and Individual Differences,Feb 19,0,"

"Psychometric properties of the Driving Cognitions Questionnaire, Driving Situations Questionnaire, and Driving Behavior Survey","['Joanne E. Taylor', 'Amanda Stephens', 'Mark J M Sullman']","Driving anxiety is a common experience that can have a significant impact on everyday functioning, especially avoidance of driving and travelling in a car. The heterogeneity of driving anxiety means that treatment often needs to address multiple areas of anxiety, cognition, and behaviour, and psychometric measures are an important part of individualised treatment and outcome measurement. There are several measures of driving anxiety, but their psychometric properties in non-clinical samples have not been adequately researched. The present study investigated the psychometric properties of three measures of driving anxiety, the Driving Cognitions Questionnaire (DCQ), Driving Situations Questionnaire (DSQ), and Driving Behavior Survey (DBS). In total, 420 participants from the New Zealand electoral roll completed a survey containing the three measures of driving anxiety, a measure of aberrant driving behaviour (the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire) and demographic and descriptive variables. The three driving anxiety scales demonstrated strong concurrent validity and the DSQ had strong discriminant validity. However, the discriminant validity findings for the DCQ and DBS were mixed. Further research is needed to evidence the psychometric properties of these measures of driving anxiety, so they can be of maximum benefit in designing tailored psychological treatment approaches.",Article,1, Transportation Research Part F Traffic Psychology and Behaviour,,0,"

"Student perceptions of the classroom environment, student characteristics, and motivation for music lessons at secondary school","['Ioulia Papageorgi', 'Natassa Economidou Stavrou']","The literature suggests that there is often no alignment between student preferences and what and how it is taught in the music classroom. A total of 749 Cypriot secondary school students, aged 12 to 14 years, responded to a survey addressing enjoyment of music, motivation for school music lessons, and perceptions of the music classroom environment. The survey included a questionnaire with six subscales: Involvement, Affiliation, Teacher Support, Task Orientation, Order and Organization, and Rule Clarity. High ratings for Affiliation, Teacher Support, and Rule Clarity suggest that, overall, students’ perceptions of the classroom environment were positive. They were not uniform, but varied on the basis of student characteristics. Girls rated Rule Clarity higher than boys. Younger students tended to rate Task Orientation, Order and Organization, and Rule Clarity higher than older students. Higher-achieving students tended to rate Affiliation and Teacher Support higher. Older boys rated Involvement lower than younger boys, whereas older girls rated Involvement higher than younger girls. It can be inferred that boys experienced a gradual increase in perceived Affiliation as their achievement improved, although the pattern was less consistent for girls. Girls tended to report higher motivation for school music lessons than boys. Motivation was enhanced by classroom environments in which students experienced higher levels of enjoyment of music, engagement, and support from teachers. The findings show that the music classroom environment should be characterized by student engagement, clarity of rules, good organization, clear goals, teacher support, and affiliation between classmates.",Article,1, Musicae Scientiae,,0,"

In 2019, the global age-standardised point prevalence and annual incidence rate of migraine were 14,107.3 (95% Uncertainty Interval [UI] 12,270.3-16,239) and 1142.5 (95% UI 995.9-1289.4) per 100,000, an increase of 1.7% (95% UI 0.7%-2.8%) and 2.1% (95% UI 1.1%-2.8%) since 1990, respectively. Moreover, the global age-standardised YLD rate in 2019 was 525.5 (95% UI 78.8-1194), an increase of 1.5% (95% UI -4.4% to 3.3%) since 1990. The global point prevalence of migraine in 2019 was higher in females and increased by age up to the 40 to 44 age group, then decreased with increased age. Belgium (22,400.6 [95% UI: 19,305.2-26,215.8]), Italy (20,337.7 [95% UI: 17,724.7-23,405.8]), and Germany (19,436.4 [95% UI: 16,806.2-22,810.3]) had the 3 highest age-standardised point prevalence rates for migraine in 2019. In conclusion, there were large intercountry differences in the burden of migraine, and this burden increased significantly across the measurement period. These findings suggest that migraine care needs to be included within the health system to increase population awareness regarding the probable risk factors and treatment strategies especially among young adults and middle-aged women, as well as to increase the data on migraines.",Article,1, Pain,Apr 3,0,"

We asked a large cross-cultural sample of single participants (N = 6,822) to rate 92 different possible reasons for being single. These reasons were classified into 12 factors, including one's perceived inability to find the right partner, the perception that one is not good at flirting, and the desire to focus on one's career. Significant sex and age effects were found for most factors. The extracted factors were further classified into three separate domains: Perceived poor capacity to attract mates, desiring the freedom of choice, and currently being in between relationships. The domain structure, the relative importance of each factor and domain, as well as sex and age effects were relatively consistent across countries. There were also important differences however, including the differing effect sizes of sex and age effects between countries.",Article,1, Cross-Cultural Research,,1,"

Psychometric Assessment of Adverse Childhood Experiences International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ) with Adults Engaging in Non-Suicidal Self-Injury,"['Rania Christoforou', 'Nuno Bravo Ferreira']","Background: The current study aimed to investigate the psychometric properties of the Adverse Childhood Experiences – International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ) with individuals engaging in non-suicidal self-injury. Numerous studies have supported the association of adverse childhood experiences with non-suicidal self-injury. However, the majority of the measures used were limited to basic forms of abuse and neglect, indicating a need for the use of a more inclusive measure, such as the ACE-IQ. The psychometric properties of the measure though have only been briefly investigated with other populations, suggesting that a more thorough examination might be beneficial before its use. Method: Two hundred eighty-four adult participants (77.5% females) with a mean age of 23.4 (SD=5.7) were recruited online via specific self-harm groups on social media platforms. Participants were asked to complete an online survey consisting of three self-report measures regarding early childhood experiences and engagement in non-suicidal self-injury. Results: The findings of this study supported ACE-IQ’s reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.854), convergent validity (r= 0.85, p<0.001 with the CTQ-SF), predictive validity (R² = 0.12, p=0.001 of the SHI total score) and discriminant validity (F-value = 13.90, p<0.001). An exploration of the factor structure demonstrated a 5-factor solution (physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, exposure to violence, family environment). Conclusions: It was concluded that ACE-IQ is a reliable and valid measure to be used for research or clinical purposes with individuals engaging in non-suicidal self-injury, although further research is needed on its factor structure. Research and clinical implications are discussed.",Article,,,,1,"

"Prevalence, deaths and disability-adjusted-life-years (DALYs) due to asthma and its attributable risk factors in 204 countries and territories, 1990-2019","['Saeid Safiri', 'Kristin V Carson-Chahhoud', 'Nahid Karamzad[...]', 'Jay S. Kaufman']","Background Understanding global trends in the point prevalence, deaths and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) for asthma will facilitate evidence-based decision making. Research Question What is the global, regional and national burden of asthma in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2019, by age, sex and socio-demographic index (SDI)? Study Design and Methods Publicly available data from the Global Burden of Disease study were used over the period 1990 to 2019. All estimates were presented as counts and age-standardised rates per 100,000, along with their associated uncertainty intervals (UIs). Results In 2019, the global age-standardised point prevalence and death rates for asthma were 3415.5 and 5.8 per 100,000, which represent a 24% and 51.3% decrease since 1990, respectively. Moreover, in 2019 the global age-standardised DALY rate was 273.6 and the global point prevalence of asthma was highest in the 5-9 age group. Also in 2019, the USA (10399.3) had the highest age-standardised point prevalence rate of asthma. Generally, the burden of asthma decreased with increasing socio-demographic index (SDI). Globally, high body mass index (16.9%), smoking (9.9%) and occupational asthmagens (8.8%) contributed to the 2019 asthma DALYs. Interpretation Asthma remains an important public health issue, particularly in regions with low socio-economic development. Future research is needed to thoroughly examine the associations asthma has with its risk factors and the factors impeding optimal self-management. Further research is also needed to understand and better implement the interventions that have reduced the burden of asthma.",Article,1, Chest,,0,"

Parental Influence and Sexual Selection,['Menelaos Apostolou'],"This chapter addresses how the genetic relatedness between parents and their children results in the two parties having converging as well as diverging interests. In the domain of mating, these interests, along with other factors such as the trade-offs inherent in mating, give rise to an opportunity cost of free mate choice: Parents have much to lose if they allow their children to exercise choice freely. This opportunity cost provides a strong incentive to parents to influence their children's mate choices. In preindustrial societies, parents manage to exercise direct control, which is predominantly manifested in the institution of arranged marriage. In postindustrial societies, parents exercise influence indirectly through manipulation. Ultimately, parental influence over mating gives rise to a sexual selection force, namely parental choice, which may be unique to the human species.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Parent-offspring conflict,['Menelaos Apostolou'],"The relationships of parents and children are dictated by their genetic interests, which are not however completely overlapping. In particular, children share 50% of their alleles with their parents, which means that their genetic interests partially converge and partially diverge. The present chapter discusses divergence of interests and the related research and implications for the field of evolutionary psychology. Parent-offspring conflict over mating is manifested in the allocation of parental investment, where children want more than their fair share of parental resources. Mating is another domain where parent-offspring conflict over mating is manifested. The individuals who children consider optimal as mates are not considered optimal as in-laws by their parents. This conflict of interests results in parental attempts to control children’s mate choices, and children’s attempts to escape from this control. Parental control over mating, when successful, can affect the course of sexual selection and thus, the evolutionary trajectory of adaptations related to mating.",Chapter,,,May 7,0,"

"Global, regional, and national burden of Guillain-Barré syndrome and its underlying causes from 1990 to 2019","['Nicola Bragazzi', 'Ali-Asghar Kolahi', 'Seyed Aria Nejadghaderi[...]', 'Saeid Safiri']","Background This article presents the first detailed analysis of the prevalence and disability burden of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) from 1990 to 2019 by cause, age, sex, and Socio-demographic Index (SDI) in 204 countries and territories. Methods Data from the Global Burden of Diseases Study (GBD) 2019 were used. GBD 2019 modelled the prevalence of GBS using hospital and claims data. Years lived with disability (YLDs) were estimated as the product of the GBS prevalence and the disability weight. This article also reported proportions in the age-standardised prevalence rate that were due to six underlying causes of GBS. Results In 2019, there were 150,095 [95% uncertainty intervals (UI) 119,924 to 188,309] total cases of GBS worldwide, which resulted in 44,407 (95% UI 28,016 to 64,777) YLDs. Globally, there was a 6.4% (95% UI 3.6 to 9.5) increase in the age-standardised prevalence of GBS per 100,000 population between 1990 and 2019. High-income Asia Pacific [1.9 (95% UI: 1.5 to 2.4)] and East Asia [0.8 (95% UI: 0.6 to 1.0)] had the highest and lowest age-standardised prevalence rates (per 100,000), respectively, in 2019. Nationally, Japan [6.4 (95% UI: 5.3 to 7.7)] and China [0.8 (95% UI: 0.6 to 1.0)] had the highest and lowest age-standardised prevalence rates (per 100,000). The age-standardised burden of GBS increased with increasing age and was higher in males in all age groups. Furthermore, the age-standardised prevalence of GBS (per 100,000) had a positive association with the level of development, as measured by SDI, although this association was not strong. Upper respiratory infections and unknown causes accounted for the highest proportions of underlying causes. Conclusions Globally, the prevalence of GBS continues to increas

The growth in the numbers of older people is one of the most important factors increasing the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) on society. The Tabriz Older People Survey (TOPS) aimed to understand the socio-demographics, health-related behaviors, and health profile of older adults. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on a representative sample of 1362 community dwelling older adults in Tabriz, the most populated city in the northwest of Iran. The sampling method was probability proportionate to size (PPS). Data collection was conducted in the households of the participants from summer 2019 to winter 2020. Trained interviewers administered the questionnaire, which measured socio-demographics, anthropometrics, social support, sleep quality, mental health, past medical history, dietary habits, traditional medicine, physical activity, and other health-related behaviors. Results: The sample of 1362 consisted of 56.4% fameless and 54.4% were young older people (60-69 years old). Almost half of the sample were completely illiterate. There was no daily walking in 13.3% of the sample, with women reporting a more sedentary lifestyle than males.

This study, based on analysis of data collected among 3,331 adolescents aged 13-17 from 48 randomly selected schools in government-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, provides an ecological and evidence-driven approach to exploring, firstly, how conflict exposure and other adversities impact on key development outcomes, and secondly, how life skills, school connectedness and family connectedness can provide protective buffers. Specifically, the study found that conflict exposure is associated with a broad range of internalizing and externalizing mental health problems; whereas exposure to micro-systemic violence (e.g. family abuse, school victimization) is additionally associated with school drop-out tendency and reduced readiness for civic participation. As for sources of resilience, the study found that collaborative skills and executive skills, in combination with parent support and teacher support, contribute most to resilience in adolescents exposed to violence in their microsystem. In contrast, adolescents that are resilient in the face of conflict exposure are more likely to be characterized by supportive relationships with peers, emotional connection to the school, inter-dependent values, collaborative problem-solving skills and tolerance of diversity. The study then goes on to explore in greater detail the specific role that can be played by the education system, measured through the concept of school connecte

This chapter proposes a rethinking of the integration-related policies by locating the problem areas. Mechanisms for intervention and regulation of the informal labour markets have been severely curtailed by the neoliberal reforms since the 1980s. Therefore, immigration and labour policies are generating and reproducing vulnerable irregulars occupying marginal labour market positions; migrant women represent the core of the global precariat. Also, public debates on irregular work by migrants and particularly migrant women generally misrepresent the social realities as narrated by migrant workers themselves. The authors argue that any emancipation narrative or any reform proposal ought to take into account the coping practices of migrant women towards restrictive immigration and labour market policies",Chapter,,,,0,"
