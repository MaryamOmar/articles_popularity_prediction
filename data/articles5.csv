Developing New Routes across North Europe: Walking in the Baltic States and England,"['John Eade', 'Tiina Sepp']","A paper written with Tiina Sepp which examines the revival of pilgrimage routes in northern Europe through a comparison between the Baltic States and England. The authors largely draw on ethnographic data based on interviews with walkers in Estonia and participant observation of one way walks in England organised by the British Pilgrimage Trust. The contemporary proliferation of pilgrimage routes across northern Europe is remarkable given the destruction of shrines during the Protestant Reformation and the concomitant rapid decline in those walking to those shrines, except in Ireland and in one of Baltic States studied here, Lithuania. While pilgrimage revived as a religious practice in England during the early twentieth century , contemporary pilgrimage has become more inclusive, being bound up with the increasing popularity of walking as a leisure activity in Europe after the Second World War, the increasing degree of individual choice, the reinterpretation of pilgrimage as a ""spiritual"" journey and increasing interest in heritage. In both the Baltic States and England the camino to Santiago de Compostela serves as an influential model but national factors (political, cultural and social) are also important.",Preprint,,,20h ago,0,"

Drivers of green supply chain management: a close-up study,"['Alaba Ososanmi', 'Lekan Ojo', 'Olajide Emmanuel Ogundimu', 'Ayodeji Emmanuel Oke']","Green supply chain management (GSCM) is an important part of most production organisations in developed countries. Meanwhile, developing countries are yet to fully embrace the concept. This study, therefore, investigated the drivers of GSCM using a close-up approach in a leading manufacturing organisation in Nigeria with sustainability initiatives. One hundred and fifty-four questionnaires retrieved from the supply chain management team of the organisation were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics such as mean score, standard deviation, and factor analysis. Based on the results of the analyses, the drivers of GSCM in the organisation could be grouped as government-related, organisational-related, and societal-related drivers. The study concluded that synergy of the government, organisations, non-government organisations, and individual is important for achieving green supply chain practices in developing countries. It was recommended that training at all levels is essential to improve the awareness and importance of sustainable production to the environment.",Article,1 , Environmental Science and Pollution Research,Dec 13,0,"

Poles Apart? EU Enlargement and the Labour Market Outcomes of Immigrants in the UK,"['Stephen Drinkwater', 'John Eade', 'Michal Garapich']","The UK was one of only three countries to allow migrants from accession countries to enter their labour markets more or less without restriction following EU enlargement in May 2004. Therefore, it is important to establish the characteristics and labour market performance of migrants from these countries who have subsequently entered the UK. We principally analyse Labour Force Survey data to compare the labour market outcomes of recent migrants from Poland and other accession countries to those of earlier migrant cohorts from these countries as well as to those of other recent migrants to the UK. We find that the majority of post-enlargement migrants from accession countries have found employment in low paying jobs, despite some (especially Poles) having relatively high levels of education. It follows that recent Polish migrants typically have lower returns to their education than other recent arrivals. Migrants from the new entrants who arrived immediately prior to enlargement possess similar characteristics and labour market outcomes, apart from having a higher propensity to be self-employed. These results are discussed in the context of policy changes, migration strategies, assimilation effects and possible impacts on the sending countries.",Article,6 , SSRN Electronic Journal,Nov 20,1,"

A protocol for the management of grapevine rootstock mother vines to reduce latent infections by grapevine trunk pathogens in cuttings,"['Helen Waite', 'Regina Billones-Baaijens', 'Josep Armengol[...]', 'Richard Smart']","A protocol is offered as a guideline for managers of rootstock mother grapevines, and as a potential research framework for to reduce infections by Grapevine Trunk Disease (GTD) pathogens in rootstock mother vines and cuttings. Latent infections by GTD pathogens in rootstock cuttings are a major source of the pathogens in grafted nursery vines and subsequently in new vineyards. The many pruning cuts made at the crowns of mother vines predispose them to infection which is transmitted to the new shoots via the xylem. Direct penetration by epiphytic inoculum on the bark of the shoots/canes can also occur. Mother vines with unprotected pruning wounds are typically heavily infected, particularly if they are not trellised. Availability of pruning wound treatments is limited in many countries. The spread of GTD pathogen inoculum can be reduced by avoiding sprinkler and flood irrigation, by trellising mother vines so that canopies are off the soil, and by spraying fungicides or painting wounds immediately after canes are harvested. Frequent trunk renewal aids in reducing inoculum. Cuts should be made to retain long internodes on the mother vines, cuttings should not contact the soil and pruning debris should be promptly destroyed. Cutting implements should be disinfested regularly and cuttings should be dipped in a registered fungicide or sterilant. Soaking cuttings increases fungal populations in the basal wounds and softens the bark, favouring penetration by pathogen inoculum. Dormant bench grafting in nurseries produces more GTD-symptomatic vines than field chip budding, so improved management for rootstock mother vines is more important where dormant cuttings are bench grafted. GTD epidemiology in source blocks is summa

Grapevine Trunk Diseases. A review,"['Mario De la Fuente Lloreda', 'Fontaine Florence', 'David Gramaje[...]', 'Corio-costet Marie-France']","Grapevine trunk diseases (GTD) are currently considered one of the most relevant challenges for the viticulture. These destructive diseases cause in vineyards several damages every year, and they are of rapidly growing concern in all wine producing countries. In 2006, the OIV established a resolution about some principal measures used to prevent or limit the proliferation of wood diseases (resolution OIVVITI 2/2006), and minor references in CST 1/2008 and CST2/2011 OIV resolutions. Recently, a new initiative has arisen inside the OIV group ""vine protection and viticultural technics (PROTEC)"" concerning to the development and impact of main trunk diseases, and their different alternatives to control or mitigation of their spread and damage at an international level of the cultivated Vitisspecies.

Fighting the Resource Curse: The Rights of Citizens Over Natural Resources,"['Jeremie Gilbert', 'Leif Wenar']","Respect for the rights of peoples over natural resources is crucial for the flourishing of communities and states. This article confirms that international law ascribes robust resource rights both to indigenous peoples and to citizens of independent states. These resource rights include indigenous peoples’ right to free, prior, and informed consent and citizens’ rights that resource revenues are never used corruptly but are used first to secure their means of subsistence. Resource rights are human rights, respect for which requires substantial reforms in the practices of corporations and investors as well as in the laws of resource-importing and resource-exporting states.",Article,,,Jul 21,0,"

"Burden, Risk Factors and Outcomes Associated with Gestational Diabetes in A Population-Based Cohort of Pregnant Women from North India","['Stuti Bahl', 'Neeta Dhabhai', 'Sunita Taneja[...]', 'Ranadip Chowdhury']","Background: The burden of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) appears to be increasing in India and may be related to the double burden of malnutrition. The population-based incidence and risk factors of GDM, particularly in lower socio-economic populations, are not known. We conducted analyses on data from a population-based cohort of pregnant women in South Delhi, India, to determine the incidence of GDM, its risk factors and association with adverse pregnancy outcomes (stillbirth, preterm birth, large for gestational age babies) and need for caesarean section. Methods: We analyzed data from the intervention group of the Women and Infants Integrated Interventions for Growth Study (WINGS), an individually randomized factorial design trial. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at the time of confirmation of pregnancy, and for those who had a normal test (≤140 mg), it was repeated at 24-28 and at 34-36 weeks. Logistic regression was performed to ascertain risk factors associated with GDM. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated to find association between GDM and adverse pregnancy outcomes and need for caesarean section. Results: 19.2% (95% CI: 17.6 to 20.9) pregnant women who had at least one OGTT were diagnosed to have GDM. Women who had prediabetes at the time of confirmation of pregnancy had a significantly higher risk of developing GDM (RR 2.08, 95%CI 1.45 to 2.97). Other risk factors independently associated with GDM were woman’s age (adjusted OR (AOR) 1.10, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.15) and BMI (AOR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.07). Higher maternal height was found to be protective factor for GDM (AOR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.00). Women with GDM, received appropriate treatment did not h

Gestational weight gain and pregnancy outcomes: Findings from North Indian pregnancy cohort,"['Ranadip Chowdhury', 'Nitika Nitika', 'Tarun[...]', 'Nita Bhandari']","Despite the high prevalence of inadequate gestational weight gain (GWG) and adverse pregnancy outcomes, very few studies have addressed the association between GWG and pregnancy outcomes in South Asia. Our objectives were to estimate the prevalence of GWG during the second and third trimesters within, below and above the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines, and to estimate the effect of the rate and adequacy of GWG on gestational age at the time of delivery, weight, length, length-forage z-score (LAZ), weight-for-length z-score (WLZ) and adverse pregnancy outcomes, namely prematurity, small-for-gestational age (SGA), low birth weight (LBW), stunting and wasting at birth. We analysed data from the intervention group of the Women and Infants Integrated Interventions for Growth Study (WINGS), which is an ongoing individually randomized factorial design study. Of the 1332 women analysed, 40.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 37.5 to 42.8] had GWG below the IOM guidelines. For every 100-g/week increase in GWG, birth weight increased by 61 g, birth length by 0.16 cm, LAZ score by 0.08 SD, WLZ score by 0.14 SD, and gestational age at birth by 0.48 days. Women with GWG below the IOM guidelines had a higher relative risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (44% for LBW, 27% for SGA, 32% for stunting and 42% for wasting at birth) than women who had GWG within the IOM guidelines, except for prematurity. The association between GWG and LAZ scores at birth was modified by early pregnancy body mass index (BMI). GWG is a strong predictor of newborn anthropometric outcomes and duration of gestation but not prematurity.

Reviewed Work(s): Post-Conflict Institutional Design: Peacebuilding and Democracy in Africa by Abu Bakarr Bah Review by: Michael Nwankpa,['Michael Nwankpa'],"Sadly, post-independent African countries have been saddled with ethnic, natural resources, and poor governance-related conflicts as they face the uphill challenge of nation-building. The heterogeneous and pluralistic nature of African postcolonial countries with their diverse ethnic groups has proven to be a serious challenge to the enjoyment of peace in the continent. Most African states have failed to manage the ethnic differences resulting in many of the civil wars in the continent. Africa’s natural resources have also been identified as a critical factor in Africa’s most brutal civil wars. Africa is endowed with natural resources, but unfortunately, this has not translated into material wealth and prosperity for the millions of African citizens who live in abject poverty. The abundance of natural resources in Africa has become a curse rather than a blessing, as it has provoked a vicious cycle of conflict and political violence. The conflicts in Africa have also been attributed to poor governance by African leaders. It is against this context that Post-Conflict Institutional Design gains salience",Book,,,Jun 20,0,"

"3 Labelling conflict groups in Nigeria: A comparative study of Boko Haram, Niger Delta, IPOB, and Fulani Militia",['Michael Nwankpa'],"In 2011, Nigeria established its first anti-terrorism legislation and Boko Haram was proscribed as a terrorist group in 2014. In 2017, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB)-a secessionist movement in the South-East of Nigeria, became the second conflict group or social movement to be proscribed by the anti-terror law. Unlike Boko Haram, IPOB’s struggle is underlined, to a large extent, by genuine grievance and its modi operandi is largely non-violent. Unsurprisingly, the proscription of IPOB did not generate the same worldwide recognition and support as that of Boko Haram. Rather, it attracted national and international condemnations. Yet, the Nigerian government has not reversed its action. This raises important questions regarding the motivation for proscribing IPOB and the impact on the group’s transformation as well as on other conflict groups and situations across Nigeria. Interestingly, the current government led by President Buhari, a Fulani, has been noticeably silent or at best expressed weak response to the ‘terrorist’ acts committed by the Fulani militia group. Also, the government’s reluctance to proscribe the militant groups in the oil rich Niger Delta region counteracts any argument regarding fairness in the application of the anti-terrorism law. This chapter therefore analyses the characteristics of each conflict group and why they attract the kind of labelling, and the implications of such on the transformation of the conflict group and the benefits or drawbacks to the government and the conflict actors.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Drag Performers’ Perspectives on the Mainstreaming of British Drag: Towards a Sociology of Contemporary Drag,"['Mark McCormack', 'Liam Wignall']","Drag performance has entered mainstream British culture and is gaining unprecedented appreciation and recognition, yet no sociological accounts of this transformation exist. Using an inductive analysis of in-depth interviews with 25 drag performers, alongside netnography of media and other public data, this article develops a sociological understanding of the mainstreaming of drag. There are two clear reasons for the success of drag. First, there is a pull towards drag: it is now seen as a viable career opportunity where performers receive fame rather than social stigma in a more inclusive social zeitgeist, even though the reality is more complex. Second, there is a push away from other creative and performing arts because heteronormative perspectives persist through typecasting and a continued professional stigma associated with drag. In calling for a sociology of drag, future avenues for research on contemporary drag are discussed, alongside the need for the sociology of cultural and creative industries to incorporate sexuality as both a subject and analytic lens.",Article,1 , Sociology,May 30,0,"

Pilgrimage,"['John Eade', 'Evgenia Mesaritou']","The multifaceted nature of contemporary pilgrimage cannot be understood from one particular discipline and, as a consequence, its study has become increasingly multidisciplinary and global in approach. Anthropologists have made a major contribution to pilgrimage studies but significant research has also been produced by those based in history, religious studies, tourism studies, geography, ethnology and folklore studies, for example, and by those undertaking research outside Europe and North America, including in the Near East, northern and southern Africa, the Asia Pacific region, Oceania, and Latin America. The contemporary practice of pilgrimage is also not restricted to institutional religion. Visits to nonreligious sites have become increasingly popular, reflecting historical change. Large numbers of people are attracted to sites of suffering, such as the First World War battlefields in France, Belgium, and Turkey; the site of the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland and the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, DC, and places associated with icons of popular culture, e.g., Elvis Presley’s grave in Memphis, Tennessee (see Reader and Walter 1993, cited under Development of the Anthropological Study of Pilgrimage). Furthermore, those journeying to and from religious pilgrimage sites have often little or no interest in institutional religion. Moreover, pilgrimage cannot be studied in isolation from wider contexts. Hence, as detailed in various sections in this article, close attention has been paid to the intimate relationship between pilgrimage and tourism, while increasing interest is being shown in the role played by political and economic processes in the development of pilgrimage.

Changes in Sexual Fantasy and Solitary Sexual Practice During Social Lockdown Among Young Adults in the UK,"['Cory J Cascalheira', 'Mark McCormack', 'Emma Portch', 'Liam Wignall']","Introduction: Pandemic-related social lockdown limited many sexual behaviors, but to date, no study has examined the perceived impact of social lockdown due to COVID-19 on sexual fantasy and solitary sexual behavior. Aims: The present study sought to examine the perceived impact of social lockdown on sexual fantasy and solitary sexual behavior among UK young adults in various living situations. Methods: A convenience sample of 565 adults aged 18-32 and living in the UK completed anonymous, web-based, study-specific questionnaires between May 14 and 18, 2020, 7 weeks after social lockdown was initiated. Mixed-method analyses were conducted. Main outcome measures: The study presents qualitative and quantitative data. Criterion variables were measured dichotomously as increases (vs no change) in sexual fantasy and increases (vs no change) in pornography consumption. Predictor variables were living arrangement, relationship status, and postlockdown changes in masturbation and pornography consumption. Results: Of all, 34.3% engaged in more sexual fantasizing during lockdown; women were more likely than men to report this increase. Living context and relationship status were predictors of increased fantasizing. Of all, 30.44% reported an increase in at least one solitary sexual practice. This increase was associated with an increase in sexual fantasizing and also with increased pornography consumption. Nineteen percent of participants reported an increase in pornography use, with men being more likely than women to report this increase. Participants mostly attributed their increases to boredom, increased free time, and replacing partnered sex. Conclusion: Shifts in sexual fantasizing and solitary sexua

The Normalization of Leisure Sex and Recreational Drugs: Exploring Associations Between Polydrug Use and Sexual Practices by English Festival-Goers,"['Mark McCormack', 'Fiona Measham', 'Liam Wignall']","The relationship between drug use and sexual practice is complex. Significant focus has been placed on risky practices, yet the broader associations between drug use and sexual activities remain elusive outside such contexts. This is despite similar trends of liberalizing attitudes and practices being identified in each area, theorized as the normalization of recreational drug use and the liberalization of consensual sexual practice. In this article, we draw on convenience sample surveys of 966 festival-goers at an English music festival in 2016 and 2019 to assess prevalence of polydrug use and to examine whether people who consume illicit drugs are more likely to engage in sexual behaviors considered more liberal than the traditional norm. We show that people who reported polydrug use in the last 12 months were significantly more likely to engage in non-traditional sexual behaviors, including sex with a friend and anal sex, in that same time period. In combining and comparing two usually distinct discourses, this exploratory study suggests that the normalization of drugs and the liberalization of consensual sexual practices are related and can be conceptualized as part of a broader societal acceptance and cultural accommodation of illicit drug use and particular sexual practices as leisure activities, despite markedly different policy and legal contexts for each activity. We conclude that the concept of “normalization” may be more appropriate to understanding changes in sexuality than “liberalization” in the context of “leisure sex” and call for further cross-disciplinary research on drugs and sex using this approach.",Article,1 , Contemporary Drug Problems,Apr 23,1,"

Drawing on a survey of 565 British adults aged 18-32 collected at the peak of social lockdown restrictions, we document an overall decrease in sexual behaviors consistent with abiding by social restrictions. We found that the levels of sexual desire reported by women (but not men) decreased compared with reports of pre-lockdown levels. Participants in serious relationships reported more increases in sexual activity than people who were single or dating casually, and there were significant differences according to gender and sexual orientation. The perceived impact of subjective wellbeing of people with high sociosexuality scores was disproportionately associated with social lockdown but there was no effect for general health. Thus, the impact on sexuality and general wellbeing should be considered by policymakers when considering future social restrictions related to COVID-19 or other public health emergencies.",Article,1 , The Journal of Sex Research,Apr 5,1,"

Indigenous Peoples,['Jeremie Gilbert'],"The rights of indigenous peoples under international law have evolved greatly since the late 1980s. Efforts by indigenous peoples to get their rights recognized under international law started during the League of Nations in the early 1920s, but it was only in 2007 that the General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) adopted the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). The adoption of the declaration not only marks an important moment in terms of lawmaking; it also represents the achievement of long decades of lobbying and advocacy from indigenous peoples’ representatives. The UN declared the decade 1994–2004 as the First International Decade of the World’s Indigenous Peoples, and later 2005–2015 was declared the second such decade. The main objective was the strengthening of international cooperation for the solution of problems faced by indigenous people in such areas as human rights, the environment, education, and health. As a result, in 2002, the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues was established as an advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council. But it was only in 2007 that the UN General Assembly adopted the UNDRIP, which universally proclaims and consolidates a specific international legal corpus of rights for indigenous peoples. The adoption of the declaration is representative of the significant legal developments of the rights of indigenous peoples under international law. The international legal framework concerns general human rights such as nondiscrimination and equality, as well as very specific collective rights such as self-determination, cultural rights, land rights, and control over natural resources.

The Invention of Sacred Places and Rituals: A Comparative Study of Pilgrimage,['John Eade'],"During the last twenty years around the world there has been a rapid increase in the number of people visiting long established religious shrines as well as the creation of new sites by those operating outside the boundaries of institutional religion. This increase is intimately associated with the revival of traditional routes, the creation of new ones and the invention of new rituals (religious, spiritual and secular). To examine this process I will focus on the European region and two contrasting destinations in particular-the Catholic shrine of Lourdes, France, and the pre-Christian shrine of Avebury, England-drawing on my personal involvement in travelling to both destinations and being involved in ritual activities along the route and at the two destinations. In the discussion section of the paper I will explore the relevance of these two case studies to the analysis of power, agency and performance and the ways in which they expose (a) the role of institutions and entrepreneurs in creating rituals and sacred places and (b) the relationship between people and the domesticated landscape.",Preprint,,,Mar 26,0,"

(GRA) and, through a critique of the value of stability pursued through this legislation, argues that recognition as a model is incompatible with the variety of experiences of non-binary trans-identified individuals. The article then moves on to analyse self-declaration, part of the proposed reform recently dismissed by the Government. While self-declaration contains provisions that would minimise the length of the process of recognition as well as the level of intrusiveness and stigma associated with it, this analysis highlights some fundamental theoretical concerns with its over-reliance on the strict dialectical logics on recognition and its structural inability to account for and respond to the challenges posed by non-binary trans individuals.",Article,1 , Law and Critique,,0,"

Boko Haram has remained active and dangerous, despite the relatively successful counter-terrorism and counter insurgency efforts by the Nigerian military, the regional counterterrorism force, and assistance from the international community. Several publications on Boko Haram have shed light on its different aspects and manifestations, but questions remain.

Sacralising the Landscape: Water and the Development of a Pilgrimage Shrine,['John Eade'],"This chapter will explore the ways in which Roman Catholic institutions seek to control nature in the form of water through the process of sacralisation. I begin with an historical overview of sacralising the landscape through Catholic pilgrimage and then introduce two theoretical approaches within pilgrimage studies (the phenomenological and relational) towards this process in the context of contemporary pilgrimage. This leads to a detailed case study of Lourdes, one of the most popular European pilgrimage shrines, where the landscape has been radically altered through the process of sacralisation where two types of water-the spring uncovered by St Bernadette during her visions in 1858 and associated with 'miraculous' healing and the river Gave-play an ever-present and potentially disruptive role. I focus particularly on the internal landscape of the baths where people engage intimately with the spring water and draw on my own experience of working as a helper between 1968 and 1992 and then again between 2013 and 2017. This enables me to explore the sensuous experience of bathing and issue of risk and trust by drawing on both discursive representations and the relational perspective. This eclectic approach also helps us to place Lourdes and its changing landscape within a wider environmental and political-economic context. Nature and Place Pilgrimage The subjugation of nature by human institutions to create an ordered, predictable and 'sacred' landscape has a long history. Machu Pichu, Stonehenge, Rome, Jerusalem, Mecca and Varanasi are just some of the most famous pilgrimage sites where landscapes reveal how the local habitat has been sacralised in the pursuit of religious interests. However, in the Christian tradition 'place

Welfarisation: Women's experiences of drug policy,['Natasha Du Rose'],"Chapter 6 discusses the social welfare strand of drug policy discourse and the technology of welfarisation. Welfarisation constructs individuals or groups as needing social support or constitutes them as unworthy of it. How female drug users are targeted for welfarisation or ‘soft-policing’ through formal and informal social control mechanisms is explored. Interventions in the lives of female users presented as policies and practices of welfare (concerned with their well-being) are often experienced as intrusive, coercive and punitive. This chapter investigates the surveillance and regulation of drug using women through welfare and social work policies and practices. Some contextual background including neoliberal policies focusing on risk and responsibility is provided. How welfarisation policies such as the denial of social security benefits and social work interventions impact on female users and their children is discussed. According to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) in Hidden harm, the children of drug-using parents are likely to be exposed to a range of hazards ‘as a result of parental problem drug use’ (ACMD, 2011, p 10, emphasis added). These include physical and emotional abuse or neglect, dangerously inadequate supervision, toxic substances in the home and exposure to criminal or other inappropriate adult behaviour. However, also included in the list of problems apparently caused by drug use are poverty, inadequate accommodation and unsatisfactory education (ACMD, 2011). Drug-using parents are therefore responsibilised for a range of social problems they may experience, which are constituted as in their control and as an outcome of their behaviour. The

Gender-collaborative training in elite university sport: Challenging gender essentialism through integrated training in gender-segregated sports,"['MF Ogilvie', 'Mark McCormack']","Competitive teamsport at university level is predominantly segregated by gender in many western countries, despite concerns that gender segregation in sport can perpetuate sexism and gender inequality. While policies and activities seek to challenge sexism and gender inequality, the use of gender collaboration within a gender-segregated system as a method to achieve this has received little attention. In this article, we draw on a year-long ethnography of elite sport and 48 in-depth interviews with elite male and female athletes at a British university to explore the impact of various forms of gender mixing during training, which we call ‘gender-collaborative training’. While men’s and women’s teams competing against each other in practice matches resulted in gender-essentialist narratives attributing difference to biology, gender-integrated practices and workouts provided opportunities for men and women to train together without the gendered sport-specific associations that can reproduce sexism. We call for gender-collaborative training to be adopted by gender-segregated teams, and suggest that where there is resistance to any integration, teams start with mixed physical workouts and progress to mixed sport-specific training and then mixed competitive training.",Article,0 , International Review for the Sociology of Sport,"Dec 27, 2020",0,"

Older Iranian Muslim women’s experiences of sex and sexuality: A biographical approach,"['Elham Amini', 'Mark McCormack']","Muslim women in Iran live in a patriarchal society which significantly restricts their freedom and agency. While there is a growing understanding of social change as it relates to younger Muslim women in Iran, the perspectives and experiences of older women are marginalized; mirroring problems with the intersections of age, gender, and sexuality in the West. In order to address this occlusion, this article draws on life history interviews with 30 older Muslim women living in Tehran and Karaj. Adopting a biographical life course approach, and examining pivotal moments related to sexuality in their lives, we discuss how cultural meanings and symbols of sexuality have emerged and been negotiated by these women at the life stages of puberty, first sex at marriage, and menopause. The patriarchal and religious gender order of Iran transgresses these women's human rights so that sexuality is experienced as a source of shame, stigma, and pollution, yet the women also exert forms of agency in their lives as they adopt and challenge these norms.",Article,0 , British Journal of Sociology,,0,"
