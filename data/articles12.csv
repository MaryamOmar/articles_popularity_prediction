Where are we now?,['Elaine Sharland'],"In 2008, the UK Economic and Social Research Council called for ‘a fundamental step change’ in breadth, depth and quality of UK social work and social care research. This paper reports some of the findings from the ESRC Strategic Adviser for Social Work and Social Care initiative, focusing on the appraisal of the existing strengths and deficits of the research field. Discussion begins with highlighting some of the challenges of identifying and characterising both social work and social care research, explaining how these were addressed. It then outlines thematically the core substantive and methodological strengths and limitations of the field identified by key informants from social work and cognate disciplines, drawing attention to disciplinary and interdisciplinary distinctiveness and synergies. Discussion concludes with pointers to the way forward for research growth and excellence, with the argument that a commitment to developing social work and social care research is all the more crucial in times of economic austerity and challenges to social welfare and wellbeing.",Article,3 , Social Work & Social Sciences Review,7h ago,0,"

"Everyday Childhoods: Time, Technology and Documentation","['Rachel Thomson', 'Liam Berriman', 'Sara Bragg']","How can we know about children’s everyday lives in a digitally saturated world? What is it like to grow up in and through new media? What happens between the ages of 7 and 15 and does it make sense to think of maturation as mediated? These questions are explored in this innovative book, which synthesizes empirical documentation of children’s everyday lives with discussions of key theoretical and methodological concepts to provide a unique guide to researching childhood and youth. Researching Everyday Childhoods begins by asking what recent ‘post-empirical’ and ‘post-digital’ frameworks can offer researchers of children and young people’s lives, particularly in researching and theorising how the digital remakes childhood and youth. The key ideas of time, technology and documentation are then introduced and are woven throughout the book’s chapters. Research-led, the book is informed by two state of the art empirical studies – ‘Face 2 Face’ and ‘Curating Childhoods’ – and links to a dynamic multimedia archive generated by the studies.",Chapter,,,Nov 14,0,"

Towards a framework for ethical innovation in children’s social care,"['Martha Hampson', 'Carlie Goldsmith', 'Michelle Lefevre']","Purpose Substantial government investment has accelerated innovation activity in children’s social care in England over the past decade. Ethical concerns emerge when innovation seems to be propelled by a drive for efficiency and over-reliance on process output indicators, as well as, or even instead of, improving the lives of children, families and societies. No ethical framework exists at present to act as a check on such drivers. This paper reviews the literature with the aim of considering how best to address this gap. Design/methodology/approach This paper draws on a review of innovation in children’s social care, conducted as part of an Economic and Social Research Council-funded project exploring innovation in services for young people exposed to extra-familial risk and harm. Findings This study proposes a new conception of “trustworthy innovation” for the sector that holds innovation in children’s social care to the standards and principles of the code of ethics for social work. This study offers an ethical framework, informed by the interdisciplinary school of organisational ethics, to operationalise this extended definition; the analytic framework guides policymakers and the practice sector to question at every stage of the innovation process whether a particular model is ethically appropriate, as well as practically feasible within a specific context. Implications for local decision-making and national policy are set out, alongside questions raised for future research. Originality/value This paper is the first to offer an ethical framework for innovation in children's social care. The conception of “trustworthy innovation” offers a guide to policymakers and the practi

Considerations in the use of local and national data for evaluating innovation in children’s social care,"['Oli Preston', 'Rebecca Godar', 'Michelle Lefevre[...]', 'Carlene Firmin']","Purpose This paper aims to explore the possibilities in using such national, statutory data sets for evaluating change and the challenges of understanding service patterns and outcomes in complex cases when only a limited view can be gained using existing data. The discussion also explores how methodologies can adapt to an evaluation in these circumstances. Design/methodology/approach This paper examines the use of data routinely collected by local authorities (LAs) as part of the evaluation of innovation. Issues entailed are discussed and illustrated through two case studies of evaluations conducted by the research team within the context of children’s social care in England. Findings The quantitative analysis of LA data can play an important role in evaluating innovation but researchers will need to address challenges related to: selection of a suitable methodology; identifying appropriate comparator data; accessing data and assessing its quality; and sustaining and increasing the value of analytic work beyond the end of the research. Examples are provided of how the two case studies experienced and addressed these challenges. Research limitations/implications • Quasi-experimental methods can be beneficial tools for understanding the impact of innovation in children’s services, but researchers should also consider the complexity of children’s social care and the use of mixed and appropriate methods. • Those funding innovative practice should consider the additional burden on those working with data and the related data infrastructure if wishing to document and analyse innovation in a robust way. • Data,

#socialwork: An International Study Examining Social Workers’ Use of Information and Communication Technology,"['Faye Mishna', 'Jane Elizabeth Sanders', 'Joanne Daciuk[...]', 'Michelle Lefevre']","Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) permeated social work practice before coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition to ICT-based formal services (e.g. e-counselling), social workers used ICTs informally as an adjunct to face-to-face practice. Building on our previous research, our cross-sectional online survey examined social workers’ informal use of ICTs in four countries: Canada, the USA, Israel and the UK. The survey was administered through Qualtrics software among social workers across Canada (n = 2,609), the USA (n = 1,225), Israel (n = 386) and the UK (n = 134), and analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 26. The findings substantiate the ubiquitous use of informal ICTs in social work practice, as an adjunct to face-to-face treatment, across the four countries. Given the current, unprecedented context of COVID-19, we discuss the meaning of our findings related to access, ethical considerations (e.g. professional boundaries) and supervision in the context of restricted face-to-face practice. We discuss the implications for social work practice, education and research, and conclude that in the COVID-19 context, there is an even greater need for research, clinical discussion, supervision and policy on informal ICT use in social work practice.",Article,1 , British Journal of Social Work,,0,"

Securing lands in peri-urban zones: Land guards and insecurity in the Awutu Traditional Area of Ghana,"['Kaderi Noagah Bukari', 'Shaibu Bukari']","The quest for land in Ghana has resulted in multiple claims to land, led to violent land conflicts and intensified chieftaincy conflicts. It has also led to private land owners and developers employing the services of land guards as means of securing and protecting their lands. These land guards, who are often armed, attack rival groups thereby endangering the lives of residents. This study is about how rival chieftaincy groups, in their quest to own and control land, use land guards to lay claims to land. We collected data through interviews, focus group discussion and media reports. The content analysis method was used to examine data for the complexities involved in how the contest for chieftaincy and the control over land fuel the activities of land guards and therefore creates insecurity in the Awutu Traditional Area. The study involved police officers, claimants to the Awutu stool, elders of the area, land guards and community residents. The study found that the activities of land guards in the Awutu Traditional Area have intensified following rival claims to chieftaincy in some parts of the Awutu Traditional Area. Various claimants to stools are using the services of land guards as a way of controlling land because one’s ascendancy to the stool is a guarantee to controlling land. Also, increase in value of land for commercial and residential purposes in the area has intensified claims to the stool. We further found that the engagement of the services of land guards by rival claimants to the stool has escalated violence and resulted in the acquisition of sophisticated arms by various land guards to fight and defend their grasp over the land. Their activities are resulting in s

Towards sustainable peace in Ghana: Essays in Memory of Francis Kojo Azuimah,"['Kaderi Noagah Bukari', 'S. B. Kendie', 'Patrick osei-kufuor', 'Shaibu Bukari']","This book was conceived as a testament to the life and times of Mr. Francis Kojo Azuimah – the first Executive Secretary of the National Peace Council (NPC) of Ghana. The late Executive Secretary worked tirelessly not only to pre-empt and manage conflicts, but also drew attention of policy makers to the underlying causes of conflict. Consequently, in all the peacebuilding efforts that the NPC engaged in during his tenure, the fundamental issues of poverty, inequality and justice were driving concerns. The chapters in this book were written mainly by academics with several years and decades of research and practice in the fields of Peace Studies, Conflict Management and Development Studies. The authors draw attention to local, regional and national attempts at managing conflicts and peacebuilding and underline the essential roles of justice and stakeholder participation as ingredients to achieve sustainable peace. This is particularly necessary in poor countries/societies where development policies are often skewed in favour of the elite. This book is essential reading for students of Peace Studies, Development Studies, Sociology and Political Science as well as persons interested in conflict and justice in society. The book is eternally dedicated to all freedom fighters and all who work for peace and justice",Book,,,,0,"

"Canadian Journal of African Studies / Revue canadienne des études africaines ISSN: (Print) ( Market women's informal peacebuilding efforts in Ekumfi-Narkwa, Ghana","['Shaibu Bukari', 'Kaderi Noagah Bukari', 'Richard Ametefe']","This study examines market women’s participation in peacebuilding in the Ekumfi-Narkwa community in the Central Region of Ghana. In peacebuilding, women are often considered victims and passive targets for aid, rather than contributors to the process. Many studies and peacebuilders have neglected the critical role played by women in the informal sector in peacebuilding, especially at the local level. This study examines how local women help build everyday peace in their community through informal means. Twenty women and four men were purposively selected and interviewed. The results show that women in the informal sector draw on bonding and bridging social capital to improve peacebuilding processes in their community. Although the women studied were not well organised and did not have much formal education, they were able to contribute to peace in their community by creating and using informal social networks/bonds. We argue that women’s societal positions are aspects of social capital that make women agents of “everyday peace” who mobilise to aid informal peacebuilding efforts in the community. However, their efforts are not being recognised and supported in organising peacebuilding activities, especially during conflict.",Article,1 , Canadian Journal of African Studies,Aug 16,1,"

Chieftaincy Conflicts in Northern Ghana: A Constellation of Actors and Politics,"['Kaderi Noagah Bukari', 'Patrick osei-kufuor', 'Shaibu Bukari']","Chieftaincy conflicts in Ghana are often presented as disputes involving rival groups over succession to traditional political power. However, chieftaincy conflicts are complex and often shaped by constellation of different actors, national and local level politics and elite maneuvering. This paper argues that chieftaincy conflicts go beyond the structural interpretations of competition and contestation for traditional power, but rather processual, encompassing constellations of diverse actors, elite politics and manipulation. In Northern Ghana, the combination of structural and processual factors drive chieftaincy conflicts. Party politics in chieftaincy conflicts have rendered chieftaincy institutions, that are supposed to be apolitical in nature, political.",Article,1 , African Security,Jun 26,0,"

Starting with the archive: principles for prospective collaborative research,"['Rachel Thomson', 'Liam Berriman']","What are participants and researchers agreeing to when they consent to having data archived and what do they imagine the future life of their data to be? In this paper, we reflect on a project that deliberately started rather than ended with the archive. The Everyday Childhoods project invited children and their families to take part in the creation of an open access public archive documenting everyday childhoods using a range of multimedia data. Families and researchers were invited into the archive, encouraged to imagine different kinds of secondary use and to speak directly to future user of their data through short films and postcards. This paper raises questions concerning the place of the archive in different disciplinary traditions; the roles of researcher and archivist in safekeeping, gatekeeping and caring for data collections; and the place of qualitative longitudinal research as a site of innovation within a new data landscape.",Article,1 , Qualitative Research,Jun 20,1,"

"Women’s self-help groups and asset accumulation in peri-urban Wa, Ghana","['Ibrahim Abdulai', 'Shaibu Bukari', 'Moses Naiim Fuseini']","Women’s self-help groups (SHGs) play an essential role in the fight against poverty. Despite this, studies on the impact of SHGs on women’s asset accumulation and incomes tend to focus on rural and urban areas, with peri-urban areas receiving little attention. Consequently, to help fill this gap, using the after-only study design, this study investigates the contribution of SHGs to asset accumulation in Wa’s peri-urban areas. A questionnaire and an observation guide were used to collect data from 199 SHG members. Thematic analysis was used to analyze qualitative data, while descriptive statistics, parametric and non-parametric methods were used to analyze quantitative data. Members were given loans, according to the study, but the repayment schedule was unfavourable. After joining SHGs, both productive and non-productive assets were acquired. Furthermore, those who took out loans and invested in income-generating ventures saw an increase in their earnings. In general, SHGs contributed to asset acquisition and income. SHG members should invest in productive assets to increase their incomes, according to the policy recommendation of this study. This study is unique because it focuses on SHGs in peri-urban areas, deviating from the norm by arguing that SHGs contribute to asset accumulation in those areas, thereby empowering members.",Article,1 , African Journal of Science Technology Innovation and Development,May 22,0,"

Encounters with liminality: - transformative practices in the building of an adoptive family,['Louise Sims'],"In England the macro context of adoption practice is characterised by radical change across administrative, political and organisational systems. The adoption regionalisation programme is underpinned by a policy commitment to speed up ‘matching’ processes. The Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 states that adoptions should ‘proceed swiftly’ and some agencies are pioneering online and virtual introductions between children and prospective adopters. This paper offers a timely contribution to practice debates and scholarship in this area. Drawing on a collaborative doctoral study, ‘everyday’ practices are considered through an emergent theoretical framework, the ‘liminal hotspot’. The analysis hones in on the transformative practices generated in the early matching stages and the role of the social worker in their mediation and management. This paper supports findings from other studies that suggest that when matches are rushed necessary processing of complex dynamics is by-passed,creating unnecessary vulnerabilities in the fabric of new families.",Article,0 , Journal of Social Work Practice,Mar 19,0,"

Surgical site infections: would stricter adherence to published clinical guidelines result in significant reduction in rates?,"['Sophie McDonald', 'Alasdair Bott']","Surgical site infections remain a prominent cause of hospital-acquired infection and are responsible for increased morbidity and mortality and considerable cost. Recommendations for strategies to reduce the rate of surgical site infections have been made by many over the years. In 2016, the World Health Organization published a robust set of guidelines with the same intention. Unfortunately, the rate of surgical site infection has not reduced as would be hoped with compilation of a large body of evidence. This article will examine those recommendations and consider if implementation of universal guidelines can successfully reduce rates of surgical site infection. Barriers to implementation of guidelines will also be contemplated, as if these factors are not addressed any future interventions will also likely by futile.",Article,0 , Surgery (Oxford),Mar 2,0,"

We would like to begin by thanking the outgoing editorial team, comprising Janet Boddy, Sara Bragg, Wendy Sims-Schouten and Rachael Stryker, for their highly skilled leadership in growing and developing the journal and its audience over the last 4 years. We particularly note their willingness to push the boundaries of theoretical developments in Childhood Studies in their themed section on The Future of Childhood Studies and Children & Society (Stryker et al., 2019). They have left us with big boots to fill. Our arrival on the journal comes during highly challenging times globally, with the Covid-19 pandemic , the climate crisis and widening socioeconomic inequalities. A global reckoning with sexual misconduct and racial injustice as witnessed in the #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter movements has both challenged and inspired research and activism in raising awareness of the pernicious effects of inequalities. This raises important questions about the relationship between significant events in society and children's lives: what do these movements teach us about childhood and what does the study of childhood teach us about these movements? Now, more than ever, there is a pressing need to ensure that the voices and lives of children are well represented across research, policy and practice. During these times, we will endeavour to continue the mission of making Children & Society a key resource for practitioners, policy-makers and scholars seeking an understanding o

The report includes 20 stories of people's experiences developed based on the interviews conducted during the study. This small scale qualitative study utilised the lens of mad studies and border thinking to interpret the results. Participants stressed the importance of having an opportunity to share their experiences with the public and relevant professionals. They also signpost the positive experience they had of community-based mental health services, the importance of initiatives run by people who are experts by experience, as well as the importance of family, friends and community support. Their stories also evidence the importance of socio-economic determinants of mental distress as well as it's link to different types of violence (including gender-based violence).

Unaccompanied Young Females and Social Workers: Meaning-Making in the Practice Space,"['Rachel Larkin', 'Michelle Lefevre']","This article considers the role and importance of the intersubjective practice space created between social workers and unaccompanied young females (UYFs)—girls and young women under eighteen years of age, who arrive in a country, not in the care of a parent or guardian, and claim asylum in their own right. The voices of UYFs are under-represented in the literature and there is very little research which considers social work with this marginalised group. Through a study of how UYFs and practitioners in England experienced and constructed each other during their everyday practice encounters, we discuss the potential of the practice space for creating mutual understandings and enabling positive changes. Analysis revealed that their subjective and affective experience of their encounters and of each other, both as individual humans and as representations of particular categories (asylum-seeker/looked-after child and professional helper/agent of the state), influenced how they engaged, communicated, co-constructed understandings of each other and viewed the process and outcomes of the social work contact. We argue for the importance of practice encounter spaces, their distinctiveness from what is written in policy and law and their potential as a site for creativity and change.",Article,0 , British Journal of Social Work,Jan 13,0,"

COVID-19 and frontline health workers in West Africa: a scoping review,"['Kingsley Pereko', 'Edward Kwabena Ameyaw', 'Shaibu Bukari[...]', 'Alfred Dickson Dai-Kosi']","Introduction The novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has become a severe global health threat since its emergence. Overcoming the virus is partly dependent on the holistic wellbeing of frontline health workers. Implications of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa could be substantial given the limited resources and logistics. This scoping review maps available literature on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa. Materials and methods Literature on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa were searched in six databases namely Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Africa Journals Online (AJOL) and CINAHL. Further search was done across websites of the ministries of health of West African countries and notable organisations. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the findings taking cognisance of the overarching purpose of the study and the research question. Results Of the 67 studies identified, 19 were included in the final synthesis. Three main themes emerged and these are impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers, drivers of susceptibility to COVID-19 and government/donor support. A greater number of the studies originated from Nigeria. Each study reported at least one impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa. The impacts included death, fear, unwillingness to attend to COVID-19 patients and stigmatisation. Some health workers were not adhering to the safety protocols coupled with periodic shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and thereby had an increased susceptibility.
