Producing Place-Based Masculine Subjectivities: Aspirations for Recognition and Status among Socially Mobile Vietnamese-Australian Young Men,"['Garth Stahl', 'Yang Zhao']","This article presents a longitudinal case study of five second-generation Vietnamese-Australian males experiencing the transition from boyhood to manhood. The participants reside in the same peri-urban region in Australia and come from families working in factories and restaurants or on farms and all aspire to pursue more middle-class forms of employment. Our investigation compels us to reflect on gendered identities as intercultural where place-based experiences open up opportunities for young men to gain recognition and status. Central to the analysis is how masculine subjectivities are embodied and performed as these young men navigate through different places. We draw on Bourdieu’s concepts (habitus, capital and field) to decipher how their experiences with place shape their sense of who they are as well as who they want to become. This case study complements scholarship which addresses intra-group differences in Vietnamese-Australian cultures, and how these differences are deeply influenced by access to and operationalisation of capital through sustained contact with various fields.",Article,1 , Journal of Intercultural Studies,2h ago,0,"

"Discovery of phthalazino[1,2-b]-quinazolinone derivatives as multi-target HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma via activating the p53 signal pathway","['Qingqing Liu', 'Bin Zhang', 'Yuanjiang Wang[...]', 'Shaohua Gou']","In view of histone deacetylases (HDACs) as a promising target for cancer therapy, a series of phthalazino[1,2-b]-quinazolinone units were hybrided with ortho-aminoanilide or hydroxamic acid to serve as multi-target HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of solid tumors. Among the target compounds, 8h possessed nano-molar IC50 values toward the tested cancer cells and HDAC subtypes, which was more potent than the HDAC inhibitor SAHA (vorinostat). Mechanism study revealed that compound 8h could suppress the HepG2 cell proliferation via prompting the acetylation of histone 3 (H3) and α-tubulin, and activating the p53 signal pathway as designed. In addition, compound 8h exhibited much stronger in vivo antitumor efficacy than SAHA in the HepG2 xenograft tumor model with negligible toxicity. As a novel multi-target HDAC inhibitor, compound 8h deserves further development as a potential anticancer agent.",Article,1 , European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry,2d ago,0,"

The soil science and archaeo-geophysics alliance (SAGA): Going beyond prospection,"['Carmen Cuenca-García', 'Kayt Armstrong', 'Elina Aidona[...]', 'Kelsey M Lowe']","Archaeological sites can be discovered and recorded in a high-resolution and non-invasivemanner using geophysical methods. These measure the spatial variation of a range ofphysical properties of the soil which may be representative proxies of the subsurfacearchaeology. Less-invasive and cost-effective field procedures have become top-priority tomitigate the destructive effects on our cultural heritage from intensified land use, climatechange and the current conflict panorama. At a time when many organisations are investing in advanced geophysical equipment, amajor problem is that our ability to fully interpret the information available from geophysical datasets is still very limited. This deficiency prevents geophysical survey moving beyond basic prospection and becoming a significant tool for answering nuanced questions about archaeology and their host landscapes. This limitation arises from an incomplete understanding of the relationship between soil properties and geophysical measurements. Bridging this gap requires multi-disciplinary teams, testing novel methods, plus scholarly discussion to collate the outcomes of projects on this topic. Overcoming these challenges is a prerequisite for maximising the costeffectiveness of geophysical methods, realising the expected benefits of technological investment and allowing broader utility of geophysical methods in the cultural heritage sector. SAGA will build an international network of geophysicists, archaeologists, soil scientists and other experts to develop our capability to interpret geophysical data and promote research collaborations.

La Antropología Histórica como crítica cultural,['Francisco Tiapa'],"Abstract. This article presents a theoretical reflection around the methodological challenges in the study of societies where ethnic and cultural differences are intrinsic conditions, and where different logics of transformation coexist in a tense, contradictory, and mutually constitutive way. The main argument sustains that the historical glance must create a distance from its own schemes of change to approach to contexts where cultural variability is simultaneous in time and space. The main emphasis will be on the multiple otherness towards the analyst’s world of reference, the variability of time, the differences in other times and other spaces, as well as the overlapping between cultural multiplicities in the same times and spaces. In addition, there will be an argument in favour of the the relevance of the relations mutually dependants, but with contradictory horizons between different multicultural universes, to go beyond the epistemological obstacles of Unilinear History. Keywords: analytical approaches, cultural critics, multiethnic societies.",Article,,,Dec 15,0,"

FDGATII : Fast Dynamic Graph Attention with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping,"['Gayan Kulatilleke', 'Marius Portmann', 'Ryan Ko', 'Shekhar Suresh Chandra']","While Graph Neural Networks have gained popularity in multiple domains, graph-structured input remains a major challenge due to (a) over-smoothing, (b) noisy neighbours (heterophily), and (c) the suspended animation problem. To address all these problems simultaneously, we propose a novel graph neural network FDGATII, inspired by attention mechanism's ability to focus on selective information supplemented with two feature preserving mechanisms. FDGATII combines Initial Residuals and Identity Mapping with the more expressive dynamic self-attention to handle noise prevalent from the neighbourhoods in heterophilic data sets. By using sparse dynamic attention, FDGATII is inherently parallelizable in design, whist efficient in operation; thus theoretically able to scale to arbitrary graphs with ease. Our approach has been extensively evaluated on 7 datasets. We show that FDGATII outperforms GAT and GCN based benchmarks in accuracy and performance on fully supervised tasks, obtaining state-of-the-art results on Chameleon and Cornell datasets with zero domain-specific graph pre-processing, and demonstrate its versatility and fairness.",Preprint,,,Dec 1,1,"

Human and Faunal Stable and Radiogenic Isotope Data from Four Bahraini and Three Jordanian Assemblages c. 5300 B.C. to 1500 AD,['Damien Huffer'],"This dataset presents carbon, nitrogen, oxygen (carbonates and phosphate) and strontium data from human and faunal remains from that portion of seven assemblages from Jordan and Bahrain currently curated at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History. Human remains from Bahraini assemblages include the Middle Islamic Period (c. 1,400-1,500 AD) cemetery associated with the Qal'at al-Bahrain fort (n=49) and the Early Dilmun City IIa-c Period (c. 2,350-1,800 BC) assemblages of Saar (n=31), Buri North (n=41) and Buri South (n=17). The Saar assemblage, at the time of sampling at the Smithsonian Institution, also included individuals recovered from isolated tombs outside the Saar mound field, with distinct alphanumeric or name designations. The Buri assemblage also contained one individual labeled BE (Buri East). Assemblages from Jordan include Early Bronze Age IB (c. 3,550-3,150 BC) Bab-edh Dhra (91 individuals selected of a total MNI of 274), the Iron Age IA (c. 1,250-1,100 BC) assemblage from a commingled cave burial from the Ba'Qa Valley (n=63), and the Late Roman (c. 200-300 AD) assemblage from Zabayir Zahir edh-Diyab, also known as the Queen Alia International Airport assemblage (n=69). Not all individuals from whom a bone sample was taken had a suitable tooth to sample as well. A cumulative total of 13 faunal samples (bone and teeth; cattle and sheep) were also obtained from the Bahraini assemblages, all but two from the Bronze Age assemblages. Results in general are consistent with those from other assemblages from both locations regardless of time period, but they also complement and expand what is known about long-distance migration and dietary div

"Risk, Reliability, and the Importance of Small-Bodied Molluscs across the Hawaiian Windward-Leeward Divide","['Ashleigh J. Rogers', 'Marshall I. Weisler']","The windward-leeward dichotomy is an important biogeographical distinction when investigating prehistoric island colonisation, settlement patterns, site use, and subsistence regimes. We analysed the mollusc remains from late prehistoric windward and leeward coastal midden sites from Moloka'i, Hawaiian Islands, to understand exploitation strategies in differing environmental contexts. Analysis of molluscan remains and their associated habitats, through a patch-choice framework, indicated that, instead of practicing different foraging regimes relative to their location, windward and leeward groups targeted small Neritidae gastropods from habitats adjacent to their home site. Despite the broad environmental differences, similar subsistence strategies may have been adopted for multiple reasons. In our windward-leeward assemblages, we suggest that mollusc size is not the paramount driver of forager decision making. Through a foraging theory lens, mollusc rank is reinterpreted beyond body size in response to prey-specific biological and ecological factors, such as aggregation and predictability. We also consider that targeted exploitation of stable, reliable, and resilient prey populations may instead be indicative of a risk management strategy in marginal, high variance environments. The best explanation may be a combination of both interpretations where the risk sensitive forager ranks prey by a different set of optimality criteria that includes targeting high-density clusters of small gastropods.",Article,1 , Human Ecology,Nov 27,1,"

Web 3.0 and future of electronic medical records,['Farzad Jahedi'],"80’s has been the starting era of using PC’s in the world and consequently in the medicine. By 2000 and popularity of web 1.0, we started the new decade of web 2.0 and social web. All these evolutions in information technology have had inevitable effect on medical information systems. 2010 and the current decade is the time for web 3.0 and semantics. Effective pass through web 3.0 will, hopefully, guide us toward web 4.0; we can call it intelligent web and subsequently intelligent medical information systems. The basic components of semantics are ontology and the knowledgebase that support the required interactions. Ontology includes lexicon and a wide variety of relationships between concepts. Internationally accepted standard ontology will be an important achievement in launching global semantics for information system. This is an ongoing project with a well-known product in medicine called “SNOMED-CT” from International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization. Around this ontological core there are different knowledgebase standards and technologies for implementation. Knowledge engineers and informaticians have different challenges in this area. There’s a wide held belief that almost all of medical data will be managed in medical information systems in less than a decade, as we can find it out in the health care provider centers around many developed and developing countries, but the next challenge will be optimum usage of this huge repository of information for the best health-care services, education and research. Although already semantics has been utilized in different levels in various electronic medical records, we have long way to use it as an applied part of our e-health system. There is a need for a gen

The relevance of basic science to stone tool use and meat eating: Standardisation of bone surface modification methods and interpretations,['Emma C. James'],"Modifications to the surfaces of fossil bones are one of the most important lines of evidence for understanding different issues in palaeoanthropological, archaeological, and taphonomic research. Bone surface modifications (BSM) are used to infer past lifeways and behaviours through site formation processes, subsistence patterns and adaptations and how they influenced human evolution, as well as patterns of economic and social evolutions. The study of BSM first appeared in palaeontology in the mid-19th Century, before gaining traction in archaeology during the processual boom of the 1960s. By identifying BSM from ethnographic studies of BSM created by people in the present day and comparing them to marks found in the archaeological record, archaeologists were able to tie traces to specific bone modifying actions (e.g. Binford 1978; Brain 1981; White 1954). However, traces left by non-human modifiers can mimic those produced by humans (e.g. Blumenschine et al. 1996; Olsen and Shipman 1988; Selvaggio 1994a; Shipman and Rose 1984). Experimental taphonomic studies in zooarchaeology have been largely conducted with the goal of confidently tying traces to known actors and effectors (Gifford-Gonzalez 1989b, 1991). However, variation in experimental design, experimental bone subjects, and how the resultant BSM are classified and analysed has contributed to a lack of consensus between researchers. For example, cut marked bones found in deposits dating to 3.39 million-years-ago (Ma) challenged the current paradigm that butchery, meat-eating behaviours and, subsequently, stone tool use were present in pre-Homo hominins (Domínguez-Rodrigo et al. 2011; McPherron et al. 2011).

Seed: Gendered Vernaculars and Relational Possibilities,"['Susannah Chapman', 'Xan Sarah Chacko']","This contribution to feminist vocabulary provides a genealogy of the term seed. We both work on practices of care and control related to seeds, from seed banking and agricultural development projects to everyday practices of keeping, saving, and tinkering with seeds. As a term, seed evokes gendered ideas about human reproduction that center masculinity and virility, even though the botanical seeds are in fact already‐fertilized embryos. This entry takes up the gendered dimension of seeds (and the elisions it produces) as a lens to interrogate ideas of use, usefulness, and uselessness (Ahmed 2019) in the world of biodiversity banking and plant genetic resources. With examples from seed banking and farming in West Africa, and with inspiration from feminist philosophers and anthropologists Sylvia Wynter, Marilyn Strathern, and Sara Ahmed, this provocation contributes to the vocabularies of feminist anthropology and science studies. Since the stories we tell about the world are filled with metaphor, why not complicate the vernacular understanding and usage of seed to reflect the queer and matrilineal possibilities that we see all around us, instead of the potent patrilineality that remains as a vestigial reminder of the values we would rather leave behind?",Article,1 , Feminist Anthropology,Nov 14,0,"

The advantages and disadvantages of each approach, as emerged from discussions with research participants, are explored. The aim of the article is to assist both decision makers and practitioners in social welfare agencies to clarify their needs in relation to how future IS are designed and used.",Article,9 , British Journal of Social Work,Nov 5,0,"

Practitioner perspectives on the implementation of an electronic information system to enforce practice standards in England,['Philip Gillingham'],"Research in England, mainland Europe and Australia has demonstrated how the introduction of electronic information systems (IS) has been highly problematic for frontline social workers, particularly in terms of diverting their time, attention and energy away from direct work with service users. IS have evolved over the years to become increasingly complex and demanding in terms of the nature and volume of data that is required to be entered by social workers. While incorporating workflows in an IS that direct social workers to specific tasks at a particular time is not new, one recently implemented IS incorporates a plethora of workflows that aim to enforce compliance with practice procedures and standards. In this article, the findings from a small qualitative study which aimed to evaluate the reaction of social workers to this new form of IS are reported. Going beyond the problems expected with the introduction of a new IS and drawing theoretically from social informatics and joint cognitive systems, the reasons why this form of IS may be particularly problematic for frontline social workers are explored.",Article,1 , European Journal of Social Work,,0,"

Species identification of Australian marsupials using collagen fingerprinting,"['Carli Peters', 'Kristine Korzow Richter', 'Tiina Manne[...]', 'Nicole Boivin']","The study of faunal remains from archaeological sites is often complicated by the presence of large numbers of highly fragmented, morphologically unidentifiable bones. In Australia, this is the combined result of harsh preservation conditions and frequent scavenging by marsupial carnivores. The collagen fingerprinting method known as zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) offers a means to address these challenges and improve identification rates of fragmented bones. Here, we present novel ZooMS peptide markers for 24 extant marsupial and monotreme species that allow for genus-level distinctions between these species. We demonstrate the utility of these new peptide markers by using them to taxonomically identify bone fragments from a nineteenth-century colonial-era pearlshell fishery at Bandicoot Bay, Barrow Island. The suite of peptide biomarkers presented in this study, which focus on a range of ecologically and culturally important species, have the potential to significantly amplify the zooarchaeological and paleontological record of Australia.",Article,1 , Royal Society Open Science,Oct 29,0,"

Spatially defined single-cell transcriptional profiling characterizes diverse chondrocyte subtypes and nucleus pulposus progenitors in human intervertebral discs,"['Yibo Gan', 'Jian He', 'Jun Zhu[...]', 'Peng Liu']","A comprehensive understanding of the cellular heterogeneity and molecular mechanisms underlying the development, homeostasis, and disease of human intervertebral disks (IVDs) remains challenging. Here, the transcriptomic landscape of 108 108 IVD cells was mapped using single-cell RNA sequencing of three main compartments from young and adult healthy IVDs, including the nucleus pulposus (NP), annulus fibrosus, and cartilage endplate (CEP). The chondrocyte subclusters were classified based on their potential regulatory, homeostatic, and effector functions in extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis. Notably, in the NP, a PROCR ⁺ resident progenitor population showed enriched colony-forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) activity and trilineage differentiation capacity. Finally, intercellular crosstalk based on signaling network analysis uncovered that the PDGF and TGF-β cascades are important cues in the NP microenvironment. In conclusion, a single-cell transcriptomic atlas that resolves spatially regulated cellular heterogeneity together with the critical signaling that underlies homeostasis will help to establish new therapeutic strategies for IVD degeneration in the clinic.",Article,1 , Bone Research,Oct 28,1,"

Targeting local lymphatics to ameliorate heterotopic ossification via FGFR3-BMPR1a pathway,"['Dali Zhang', 'Junlan Huang', 'Xianding Sun[...]', 'Yangli Xie']","Acquired heterotopic ossification (HO) is the extraskeletal bone formation after trauma. Various mesenchymal progenitors are reported to participate in ectopic bone formation. Here we induce acquired HO in mice by Achilles tenotomy and observe that conditional knockout (cKO) of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 ( FGFR3 ) in Col2 ⁺ cells promote acquired HO development. Lineage tracing studies reveal that Col2 ⁺ cells adopt fate of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) instead of chondrocytes or osteoblasts during HO development. FGFR3 cKO in Prox1 ⁺ LECs causes even more aggravated HO formation. We further demonstrate that FGFR3 deficiency in LECs leads to decreased local lymphatic formation in a BMPR1a-pSmad1/5-dependent manner, which exacerbates inflammatory levels in the repaired tendon. Local administration of FGF9 in Matrigel inhibits heterotopic bone formation, which is dependent on FGFR3 expression in LECs. Here we uncover Col2 ⁺ lineage cells as an origin of lymphatic endothelium, which regulates local inflammatory microenvironment after trauma and thus influences HO development via FGFR3-BMPR1a pathway. Activation of FGFR3 in LECs may be a therapeutic strategy to inhibit acquired HO formation via increasing local lymphangiogenesis.",Article,1 , Nature Communications,,1,"

New insights on the reparative cells in bone regeneration and repair,"['Shuo Huang', 'Min Jin', 'su Nan', 'Lin Chen']","Bone possesses a remarkable repair capacity to regenerate completely without scar tissue formation. This unique characteristic, expressed during bone development, maintenance and injury (fracture) healing, is performed by the reparative cells including skeletal stem cells (SSCs) and their descendants. However, the identity and functional roles of SSCs remain controversial due to technological difficulties and the heterogeneity and plasticity of SSCs. Moreover, for many years, there has been a biased view that bone marrow is the main cell source for bone repair. Together, these limitations have greatly hampered our understanding of these important cell populations and their potential applications in the treatment of fractures and skeletal diseases. Here, we reanalyse and summarize current understanding of the reparative cells in bone regeneration and repair and outline recent progress in this area, with a particular emphasis on the temporal and spatial process of fracture healing, the sources of reparative cells, an updated definition of SSCs, and markers of skeletal stem/progenitor cells contributing to the repair of craniofacial and long bones, as well as the debate between SSCs and pericytes.

Exploring the politics of strain: Crime and welfare in remote Indigenous Australia,"['Zoe Staines', 'Renee Zahnow']","The international criminology and social policy literature have long explored possible connections between social welfare and crime. However, existing studies tend towards high‐level comparisons of crime versus total aggregate welfare spend, overlooking sub‐national contextual differences between and within countries. There are also few studies that deeply explore this link in the Antipodes, including in Australia: a settler colony and (neo)liberal welfare state with a recent strong coupling of punitive social and penal policies that disproportionately impact Indigenous populations. This paper attends to these gaps by examining the welfare‐crime link in remote Indigenous Queensland (Australia). We use crime‐report data and an interrupted time series design to explore the effects of dynamic social welfare policies during 2020–2021: a period that saw a temporary shift away from a strict neoliberal welfare model (i.e., heavy conditionality, low benefit rates) to more supportive and decommodifying social welfare in response to the COVID‐19 induced economic recession. Our findings align with previous studies that suggest more supportive and decommodifying policies are associated with lower crime. We also bring greater nuance to how the crime‐welfare link is understood within the ‘structural complexity of [Australian] settler colonialism’ (Wolfe. Journal of Genocide Research. 2006;8:392), by illuminating how a politics of race animates social policies that can either produce or reduce criminogenic strains and, thus, socially construct crime in the image of the Indigenous ‘Other’.",Article,1 , Social Policy & Administration,Oct 26,0,"

Fear and Loathing in Legal Limbo: Reimagining the Refugee in Malaysian Public Discourse and History,"['Gerhard Hoffstaedter', 'Nicole Lamb']","The dominant public discourse on refugees in Malaysia is characterised by portrayals of refugees as illegal, burdensome and a threat to the nation’s security. Malaysia is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention or its related 1967 Protocol and therefore does not provide legal recognition to those who claim refugee status. Nonetheless, Malaysia is host to hundreds of thousands of refugees who live not in camp settings but in the community, most in urban environments. Refugees from Myanmar form the vast majority of Malaysia’s refugee population while smaller, though still substantial, communities are made up of refugees who originate from Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Yemen, Somalia, Iraq and Syria. This chapter interrogates key discourses around what a refugee is in Malaysia and how the dominant discourses, or what Michel Foucault calls ‘regimes of truth’, construct refugees and link them above all to the pervasive notion of ‘illegality’. The prevailing discourses pertaining to the refugee population are reiterated and shaped by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Malaysian state and its institutions, civil society, the traditional media and other consumable information systems. Here, these depictions are challenged through an exploration of alternative narratives and readings. In recent years stories of Malaysia’s refugee population have begun to emerge in the mainstream media and elsewhere. These accounts have played an important role in developing the refugee as a figure in the national consciousness. Personal stories recorded with refugees living in Malaysia are explored to demonstrate how refugee narratives are shaped by and speak back to the public discourse.

In order to better understand driver experience most research conducted to date differentiates driver experience by driver investment (time) on the platform.

We present findings from a mixed methods study into migrant and non-migrant drivers on the Uber platform in Queensland, Australia. Specifically, our data illustrates key differences between migrants and non-migrants’ motivations to drive, their dependency on the platform, and their sense of autonomy and agency.

Silcrete is not a monolith: Heat treatment of silcrete and the economy of backed artefact manufacture,['Owen Budd'],"The use of heat treatment of silcrete and the manufacture of backed artefacts during the mid-to-late Holocene in Eastern Australia is believed to have provided considerable benefits in the use of silcrete, and the ability to produce reliable and maintainable composite toolkits. The relationship between these two technologies has been identified in the archaeological record, however a study to investigate how these two technologies function in tandem has not yet been explored systematically in Australia. This thesis will use replicative and experimental methods to heat treat a sample of silcrete sourced in Queensland and produce an assemblage of backed artefacts. The performance of heat treated silcrete, both in flake production and successful backed artefact production, will be compared against matching raw (untreated) silcrete cores from the same nodule. Analysis will seek to identify the effect of heat treatment within the reduction sequence, and the extent of variation in backed artefact size to establish the level of standardisation achieved. Results suggest that silcrete responds variably to heat treatment. Some source nodules significantly increased the volume of backed artefacts produced per core, as well as improved standardisation of backed artefacts produced to fit an ‘Ideal Backed Artefact’ prototype. However, other source nodules may have reduced backed artefact production qualities. Since heat treatment has varying effects within the reduction sequence, cultural knowledge surrounding source quality would have been a key component of prehistoric technological knowledge. This interpretation advances the argument that silcrete is not monolithic in it response to heat treatment, and therefore may have variation in its use in prehistory.",Thesis,,,Oct 18,1,"

Human enhancement drugs: Emerging issues and responses,"['Vivian D Hope', 'Mair Underwood', 'Kyle J.D. Mulrooney[...]', 'Jim Mcveigh']","It can be argued that there are no ‘enhancement’ drugs per se, for en- hancement is not an objective property of any drug but rather a meaning assigned to the drug on the basis of the expected effects of that drug. Thus all drugs could be enhancement drugs if deemed to be, for the def- inition of enhancement depends on the meaning we, as a society, give to the drugs’ effects. If a drugs’ effects are deemed to be detrimental that drug may be considered a ‘poison’ or ‘toxin’. If the effects of a drug are deemed valuable or beneficial, and the drug is used to restore or sustain ‘health’ or ‘normality’, the drug may be deemed ‘therapeutic’ or a ‘medicine’. If the effects of the drugs are experienced as beneficial but those benefits are not seen as necessary to restore or sustain health, these drugs may be deemed ‘recreational’ (if the drug is used primarily for ‘pleasure’) or ‘enhancing’. Whether or not drug use is considered en- hancement depends in large part on our definition of ‘normality’, and on what we, as a society, value. The term ‘enhancement’ refers to changes that are considered to be in a positive direction, that is, they are ‘im- provements’ or changes that are viewed as increasing value, and that alter an individual to a state which society has deemed above ‘normal’. Enhancement is commonly defined by bioethicists as “interventions that are used to improve human form or functioning beyond what is necessary to restore or sustain health” (Juengst & Moseley, 2019). However, whilst there are established definitions of ‘health’, such as the WHO “Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”, these are typically broad and so open to interpretation (e.g. is it merely repair and maintenance or

This assemblage of crania (n=45) was acquired by one Richard Heinrich Robert Parkinson (1844‐1909), a Danish explorer and anthropologist initially in the employ of the Hamburg based J. C Goddefroy & Sohn in Samoa trading firm. In 1897, after independently settling on the Gazelle Peninsula of New Britain with his family and beginning to make collecting trips to local communities and those on neighboring islands, this collection of crania eventually came to reside at its present location. This article provides the first in‐depth analysis of the osteology of this collection contextualized within what is known and knowable about its ownership history and movement between collection and arrival in Stockholm. This includes translation of previously untranslated German documents that provide heretofore undisclosed information about Parkinson’s collecting activities. Osteological analysis includes age and sex estimation, taphonomic modification as an indicator of initial depositional environment, discussion of select examples of pathology and trauma, and the comparative analysis of decorative motifs (where present). Results indicate a primarily young adult male assemblage, but with all major age classes and both sexes present. Incidents of trauma and pathology are low, but some unique examples are highlighted. The results of the taphonomic analysis reveal new insights in

Surprise Reveals the Affective-Moral Economies in Cancer Illness Narratives,"['Stefanie Plage', 'Rebecca E Olson']","Emotions, like joy and sorrow, feature in illness narratives, dramatizing stories of becoming: sick, well, controlled, in control. However, brief emotions, such as surprise, have received limited analytic attention in cancer illness narratives. Drawing on 20 interviews with 11 participants with diverse cancer diagnoses, along with the 455 photographs they produced for this study, we address the complex interactions between discourse, societal expectations, and perceptions in moral-affective economies. Tracing the emergence, deployment, and silencing of surprise provided an avenue to explore connections between affect, morality, advocacy, and philanthropy. We show how surprise works to deny uncertainties couched in individual risk, and situate cancer causation within the logics of anticipation, (re)producing socio-cultural etiology narratives. Attending to surprise reveals how some cancers are situated as individual responsibilities, with restricted access to compassion and collective resources. Thus, we interrogate the affective-moral economy underpinning cancer illness narratives, and surprise’s pivotal role in its analysis.",Article,1 , Qualitative Health Research,Oct 11,0,"

Teoría y Métodos de la Etnografía,['Francisco Tiapa'],"A lo largo de la historia de las Ciencias Humanas, se han creado marcos epistemológicamente unificados al mismo tiempo que se han consolidado las esferas de especialización de cada disciplina. Así, en casi dos siglos se ha creado un proceso doble donde, cada esfera de conocimiento, desde su ámbito concreto de aplicación, ha construido teorías, métodos y descubrimientos empíricos que han nutrido los supuestos básicos de las Ciencias en general, sean estas naturales, sociales o humanidades. Por ejemplo, desde la Psicología, la idea de inconsciente impactó las teorías sobre la mente humana y, por su parte, la Sociología fundó su campo de conocimiento gracias al principio de que no hay comportamiento, por individual que parezca, que no tenga una determinación social. La Historia, a su vez, nos ha enseñado que cada época debe ser entendida según sus propios términos y no desde nuestros prejuicios creados en el presente. Con un sentido similar, desde la Antropología, el principio de que cada cultura piensa y actúa sobre el mundo de manera relativa y desde su propia vivencia pasó a nutrir esta amalgama de conceptos y de fundamentos epistemológicos. Como una derivación de este supuesto teórico, el método etnográfico-en principio el método específico de la Etnología, como subdisciplina de la Antropología-pasó a constituirse como un método cualitativo epistemológicamente sólido, admitido y empleado en el resto de las ciencias humanas. Dado que se parte del principio de la aprehensión del punto de vista del nativo, se sostiene que sólo la experiencia sostenida, rutinaria y gradual de la observación participante es capaz de acceder a esta perspectiva de la re

Diálogos Interdisciplinares en las Ciencias Sociales,['Francisco Tiapa'],"Las discusiones contemporáneas sobre la necesidad de apertura de diálogos inter-disciplinarios en las Ciencias Sociales, han llevado a una profunda revisión de los procesos históricos que ha creado, así como y las bases epistemológicas que sustentan a las barreras entre diferentes ámbitos de conocimientos. Así, se ha puesto en discusión la validez de estas fronteras entre campos de conocimiento a partir de la puesta en evidencia de la fragilidad de sus sustentos intelectuales. Esto ha sido especialmente patente en las discusiones en torno al sustrato colonial de las bases del así llamado pensamiento moderno y de los criterios clasificatorios de los diferentes espectros de la realidad. Sobre la base de la idea de la diferencia entre sujeto y objeto, por ejemplo, se ha creado un amplio conjunto de divisiones dicotómicas en torno a las cuales se ha estratificado la valoración de las diferentes formas de condiciones humanas y no humanas que han sido ""objeto de estudio"" de las ciencias modernas. Como un derivado de este amplio sistema taxonómico del saber, se ha creado la imagen de una realidad sustantiva y esencialmente diferente entre el ""nosotros"" europeo y los ""otros"" no europeos, entre el presente y el pasado y hasta entre los ámbitos de la sociedad civil, la política y la economía. En suma, se han creado escisiones de la realidad que han llegado al punto de presentar a las barreras disciplinarias, históricamente creadas, como si fuesen realidades sustancialmente dadas. A partir de esta discusión en torno a la necesidad de superar las barreras entre espectros del saber en las ciencias humanas y entre estas y las así llamadas ciencias naturales, se sugiere la elaboración de un ensayo basado en las diferente

Antropologia Historica,['Francisco Tiapa'],"En el contexto global contemporáneo, la ruptura de barreras disciplinares es cada vez más necesaria. La Antropología orientada al estudio de las sociedades del presente se ha caracterizado por el conocimiento y comprensión de los universos culturales ajenos o subalternos al llamado Mundo Occidental. De esta manera, a lo largo de su recorrido disciplinar, la Antropología ha pasado por diversas fases, según los momentos históricos en los que se han encontrado sus productores. Si bien en sus principios fue el justificativo de la expansión colonial de Europa, en el presente se ha constituido como la principal herramienta discursiva de reivindicación de las maneras de ver al mundo alternas a lo impuesto por la modernidad industrial. Tal potencialidad de la Antropología como herramienta de contestación de las subalternidades del Sistema Mundo Moderno también se ha volcado hacia el rescate y reivindicación de las historias olvidadas por la llamada Historia Oficial. Desde la Historia, como disciplina, la apertura hacia las Ciencias Sociales ha desembocado en una preocupación por la reconstrucción del pasado de las poblaciones comúnmente olvidadas por las agendas de trabajo más tradicionales. Este lugar común ha llevado a la elaboración de agendas de trabajo con fines concretos de incorporación de la diversidad cultural del pasado, así como de las diversas formas en que este pasado puede ser entendido.

Teoria del desarrollo sociopolitico de Venezuela,['Francisco Tiapa'],"En toda sociedad, la forma en que se piensa y se practica la política está enmarcada en un modelo ideal de vida correspondiente con una dinámica social enmarcada en un modelo cultural variable en tiempo y en espacio. En tal sentido, para comprender como se forman las relaciones y las estructuras de poder, es prioritario entender cuales son esos modelos ideales. El proceso de formación sociopolítica de Venezuela está directamente vinculado con su posicionamiento dentro del Sistema Mundo Moderno, configurado con la expansión colonial de Europa y la consecuente formación de Estados Nacionales post-coloniales. Al igual que el resto de las naciones formadas dentro de esta condición, en Venezuela se formó una sociedad de clases, donde la verticalidad se define según la adherencia al modelo cultural impuesto desde los centros hegemónicos globales, estén estos en Europa o en los Estados Unidos. En esta estructura, los descendientes culturales de los europeos han definido e impuesto el patrón social y los distintos proyectos de Estado, como un horizonte a seguir, creando así una suerte de utopía nunca alcanzada. De este modo, la relación entre las clases dominantes y el resto de los sectores sociales se ha definido por una dinámica en la que los primeros han llevado a cabo distintos proyectos civilizatorios, orientados a la homogeneización cultural de la sociedad venezolana, mientras que los segundos, según el momento histórico, o bien han aceptado este patrón o bien han generado diversas formas de organización social para poder tener continuidad histórica dentro de este orden cargado de tensiones y contradicciones.

The pharmaceuticalisation of ‘healthy’ ageing: Testosterone enhancement for longevity,"['Matthew Dunn', 'Kyle J.D. Mulrooney', 'Cynthia Forlini[...]', 'Mair Underwood']","The United Nations estimates that the world's population will reach 8.5 billion by 2030, and the populations of most countries are expected to grow older. This is case for many developed countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States of America, and member states of the European Union. Older cohorts will comprise a larger proportion of overall populations, driven in part by our increases in life expectancy. An ageing population poses challenges for governments; notably, older people tend to have multiple, chronic health conditions which can place a burden of health budgets. At the same time, we are witnessing a shift in how we respond to the health needs of our populations, with global drug policy acknowledging that some substances are contributing to increased morbidity and mortality (e.g. opioids) while others may have beneficial therapeutic effects (e.g. psylocibin, cannabis). There is general agreement that as men age their levels of testosterone decrease, and there is some evidence to suggest that there have been population-level declines in testosterone which are not associated with age. Anecdotally, testosterone is accessed by men seeking to self-medicate in the belief that they are experiencing low testosterone levels. There has also been a rise in anti-ageing clinics in the United States, providing access to testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). The non-medical use of testosterone can result in a number of adverse health events, including complications from the use of black market or underground products. Placing testosterone under a new prescribing regime may address some of these concerns, but is society ready for this change, and if so, what would this regime loo

Underwood. 2020. Testing the boundaries Self-medicated testosterone replacement and why it is practised,"['Mair Underwood', 'Katinka Van de Ven', 'Matthew Dunn']","Background: Testosterone is used therapeutically in medical settings. Non-prescribed testosterone use is typically illegal, described as ‘enhancement’ or ‘doping’, and considered a problem. However, research has found that some non-prescribed testosterone use may be therapeutic (i.e. self-medication). Little is known about testosterone self- medication. It has been noted among individuals who use image and performance enhancing drugs (IPEDs), but never systematically explored. Approach: This paper describes the findings of a 4-year ethnographic study in online forums and social media groups frequented by people who use IPEDs. It focusses on 31 men who used enhancement doses of testosterone, but who described some of their testosterone use as ‘testosterone replacement therapy’ (TRT). In particular, it focuses on the 26 (84%) of these individuals who self-medicated TRT. Data was analysed thematically (using NVivo) in order to answer the question: ‘how and why is testosterone self-medicated?’. Using Bacchi’s (2016) prob- lematization approach to policy analysis, this paper also asks, ‘what happens to the ‘problem’ of non-prescribed testosterone use if such use is therapeutic?’. Findings: Self-medicated TRT was found to be very similar to TRT as practised in medical contexts. Self- medication was often practised because of an inability to access testosterone through health practitioners (who were either reluctant or unable to prescribe). However, some individuals were found to prefer self-medication because of price, ease of access, reliability of supply, and because health practitioners were perceived as lacking expertise regarding testosterone use. Conclusion: By documenting the therapeutic use of test

An Australian newspaper campaign and government vaccination policy An Australian newspaper campaign and government vaccination policy,['Julia LeMonde'],"News Corp Australia recently initiated a campaign to pressure the Australian government to amend its childhood vaccination policies. In 2015, the government legislated amendments in accord with the campaign's demands despite criticism from experts in children's health and vaccine advocacy, research and surveillance. A narrative review was conducted of newsprint articles which featured during the media campaign between 2013 and 2015. Findings indicate that the campaign focused on moral attributes that stigmatised conscientious objector parents as 'anti-vaxers', baby-killers, and hippies and loons. The decision to change vaccination legislation is compatible with the creation of a media-manufactured moral panic concerning conscientious objector parents. When deconstructing moral panics, a careful analysis of the roles of different media sectors is important. The alliance between News Corp Australia and Australian politicians to introduce new vaccination legislation represents an innovation in health policy formation which illustrates how expert opinion on public health policies can be sidelined.",Article,1 , Prometheus,Sep 20,0,"

How effective is conditional welfare support for enhancing child wellbeing? An examination of compulsory income management (welfare payment quarantining) in Australia,"['Steven Roche', 'Philip Mendes', 'Gregory Marston[...]', 'Louise Humpage']","Conditional welfare, a social policy mechanism in which disadvantaged groups are required to conform to behavioural changes to receive income support, has become an influential policy mechanism in recent decades. Conditional welfare in Australia involves compulsory income management (CIM), comprising the quarantining of between 50 and 90 per cent of a participant’s welfare payment for use on food, rent and other essential items. A major objective of all Australian income management (IM) programs since 2007 has been to enhance children’s wellbeing by protecting them from harm caused by anti-social behaviour such as alcohol and drug abuse, and ensuring they have access to basic needs such as food, education and health care. To explore the outcomes of these objectives, this qualitative study explores the views of both compulsory and voluntary IM participants as well as community stakeholders in relation to child wellbeing in four IM locations across Australia. It finds minimal evidence to support the view that IM contributes to positive outcomes in children’s welfare.",Article,1 , Children and Youth Services Review,Sep 19,0,"

Afflexivity in post-qualitative inquiry: prioritising affect and reflexivity in the evaluation of a health information website,"['Jenny Setchell', 'Rebecca E Olson', 'Merrill Turpin[...]', 'Paul W Hodges']","Increasingly, people turn to online sources for health information, creating human-non-human relationalities. Health websites are considered accessible in scope and convenience but can have limited capacity to accommodate complexities. There are concerns about who gets to ‘assemble’ with these resources, and who is excluded. Guided by Ahmed’s socio-political theories of emotions, we questioned our feelings as we intra-acted with a consumer information website about back pain (MyBackPain). This encouraged us to approach resource evaluation in a way that alters conventional rational/cognitive judgement processes. Our inquiry was ‘supra-disciplinary’ involving public health, sociology, allied health and consumer collaborators. Specifically, we considered relationality – the feelings circulating between bodies/objects and implicated in MyBackPain’s affective practices; impressions – the marks, images or beliefs MyBackPain makes on bodies/objects; and directionality – how these intra-actions pushed in some directions and away from others. Although Ahmed would likely not consider herself ‘post-humanist’, we argue that her socio-political theories of how objects and emotions entangle are of great interest to furthering critical post-human understandings of health. Rather than threatening decision-making, we suggest that feelings (and their affects) are central to it. The article demonstrates the productive potential of critical post-human inquiry in identifying/countering ‘othering’ possibilities, and catalysing a ‘nomadic shift’ towards new human-non-human formations.",Article,1 , Health Sociology Review,Sep 14,0,"

Based on the results of a qualitative study, we found a significant service disparity between the affluent and the poor communities. This disparity is due to the inability of the poor to hold service providers accountable, attributable to a lack of knowledge about services and a lack of social status. Lack of quality monitoring and a marked bias in the quality of interactions between the poor and the affluent contribute to the service disparity This disparity is largely invisible to the poor who, instead of comparing themselves with the affluent citizens, compare themselves with a similar class of people.",Article,1 , South Asian Survey,Sep 14,1,"

Factor structure of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Australian Vietnam Veterans: confirmatory factor analysis of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM–5,"['John Gilmour', 'Madeline Romaniuk']","Introduction: The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM–5) brought a change to the symptom clusters of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In line with the DSM–5 changes, an updated version of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS–5) was released. The CAPS–5 is considered to be the gold-standard measure of PTSD; however, examinations of the psychometric properties and optimal factor structure of this scale are underrepresented in PTSD studies. Methods: This study used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to assess the factor structure of the CAPS–5 using a sample of 267 male Australian Vietnam Veterans. Models drawn from the PTSD CFA literature were used to test the underlying dimensions of PTSD: the four-factor DSM–5 model, six-factor externalizing behaviour and anhedonia models, and seven-factor hybrid model. Results: The results found that the DSM–5 model showed slightly less than adequate fit (comparative fit index [CFI] = 0.90, Tucker–Lewis index [TLI] = 0.88, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.064), however, other models showed acceptable fit. The anhedonia model provided a significantly better fit than the other models (CFI = 0.92, TLI = 0.90, RMSEA = 0.059). Discussion: Overall, the results supported the anhedonia model. This result may indicate that the underlying dimensions of PTSD in Australian Vietnam Veterans may best be represented by six distinct factors.",Article,0 , Journal of Military Veteran and Family Health,Sep 8,0,"

Adil Khan']","We highlight how the intentions of a government to improve services and transparency across a city, by providing an enhanced right to the city for the urban poor can be futile when political gatekeeping is not relinquished at the grassroots level and the poor are not mobilised and educated about their rights. A qualitative case study of poor informal settlements was conducted in Rajshahi Bangladesh, to investigate a greater right to the city as the result of a ‘citizens charter’ initiated by local government. This research focusses on the poorest of the poor, who are often overlooked in community-based research due to their inability to attract the support of NGOs and donors means they are particularly vulnerable to this system of urban patron-clientism. We find that attempts by the city government to improve services to the poorest of its citizens is hampered by entrenched patron client practices perpetuated by local political representatives of the city government acting as gatekeepers, blocking access to services for the urban poor.",Article,1 , Forum for Development Studies,Sep 5,0,"

Triaging online child abuse material: testing a decision support tool to enhance law enforcement and investigative prioritisation,"['David Mount', 'Lorraine Mazerolle', 'Renee Zahnow', 'Leisa James']","Purpose Online production and transmission of child abuse material (CAM) is a complex and growing global problem. The exponential increase in the volume of CyberTips of CAM offending is placing information processing and decision-making strains on law enforcement. This paper presents the outcomes of a project that reviewed an existing risk assessment tool and then developed a new tool for CAM triaging and investigative prioritisation. Design/methodology/approach Using a mixed method approach, the authors first explored the capacity of an existing risk assessment tool for predicting a police action. The authors then used these findings to design and implement a replacement CAM decision support tool. Using a random sample of CyberTip alert cases from 2018, the authors then tested the efficiency of the new tool. Findings The existing risk assessment tool was not fit for CAM triaging purposes. Just six questions from the old tool were found to be statistically and significantly associated with law enforcement agents achieving a police action. The authors found that an immediate threat of abuse/endangering a child, potential case solvability, CAM image assessment, chat assessment, criticality and some weighting for professional judgement were significant in being associated with a police action. The new decision support tool is more efficient to complete and achieved a 93.6% convergence of risk ratings with the old tool using 2018 case data. Originality/value This research is unique in its development of an evidence-based decision support tool that enhances the ability of law enforcement agents to objectively and efficiently triage and prioritise increasing numbers of CyberTip alerts.",Article,1 , Policing An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management,Aug 31,0,"

"Revisiting Kalundu Mound, Zambia: Implications for the Timing of Social and Subsistence Transitions in Iron Age Southern Africa","['Steven Goldstein', 'Alison Crowther', 'Edward Henry[...]', 'Nicole Boivin']","Novel trajectories of food production, urbanism, and inter-regional trade fueled the emergence of numerous complex Iron Age polities in central and southern Africa. Renewed research and re-dating efforts in Botswana, Zimbabwe, and along the Swahili Coast are transforming models for how inter-regional interaction spheres contributed to these patterns. While societies in present-day Zambia played an important role in the trade of copper, ivory, gold, and other resources between central and southern Africa, little is known about lifeways during the rise of social complexity in this region. This paper reports the results of re-excavation at Kalundu Mound on the Batoka Plateau of southern Zambia, one of the iconic mound sites of the Iron Age “Kalomo Culture.” New radiocarbon dates were combined with the original dates in a series of Bayesian models, indicating that previous chronologies for the site are not reliable and that the mound site likely developed rapidly from AD 1190 to 1410. Archaeobotanical, zooarchaeological, and paleo-proteomic analyses of excavated materials suggests a broad subsistence base combining wild and domesticated species, including the first reported evidence for finger millet (Eleusine coracana) in the region. Considering these findings, it is necessary to re-evaluate the temporal context of the Kalomo site-group, and to also systematically reinvestigate the systems of exchange and subsistence that supported Later Iron Age complexity.",Article,1 , African Archaeological Review,Aug 30,1,"

"67,000 years of coastal engagement at Panga ya Saidi, eastern Africa","['Patrick Faulkner', 'Jennifer Miller', 'Eréndira M. Quintana Morales[...]', 'Michael D. Petraglia']","The antiquity and nature of coastal resource procurement is central to understanding human evolution and adaptations to complex environments. It has become increasingly apparent in global archaeological studies that the timing, characteristics, and trajectories of coastal resource use are highly variable. Within Africa, discussions of these issues have largely been based on the archaeological record from the south and northeast of the continent, with little evidence from eastern coastal areas leaving significant spatial and temporal gaps in our knowledge. Here, we present data from Panga ya Saidi, a limestone cave complex located 15 km from the modern Kenyan coast, which represents the first long-term sequence of coastal engagement from eastern Africa. Rather than attempting to distinguish between coastal resource use and coastal adaptations, we focus on coastal engagement as a means of characterising human relationships with marine environments and resources from this inland location. We use aquatic mollusc data spanning the past 67,000 years to document shifts in the acquisition, transportation, and discard of these materials, to better understand long-term trends in coastal engagement. Our results show pulses of coastal engagement beginning with low-intensity symbolism, and culminating in the consistent low-level transport of marine and freshwater food resources, emphasising a diverse relationship through time. Panga ya Saidi has the oldest stratified evidence of marine engagement in eastern Africa, and is the only site in Africa which documents coastal resources from the Late Pleistocene through the Holocene, highlighting the potential archaeological importance of peri-coastal sites to debates abou

Papua New Guinean Genomes Reveal the Complex Settlement of North Sahul,"['Nicolas Brucato', 'Mathilde André', 'Roxanne Tsang[...]', 'Francois X Ricaut']","The settlement of Sahul, the lost continent of Oceania, remains one of the most ancient and debated human migrations. Modern New Guineans inherited a unique genetic diversity tracing back 50,000 years, and yet there is currently no model reconstructing their past population dynamics. We generated 58 new whole genome sequences from Papua New Guinea, filling geographical gaps in previous sampling, specifically to address alternative scenarios of the initial migration to Sahul and the settlement of New Guinea. Here, we present the first genomic models for the settlement of northeast Sahul considering one or two migrations from Wallacea. Both models fit our dataset, reinforcing the idea that ancestral groups to New Guinean and Indigenous Australians split early, potentially during their migration in Wallacea where the northern route could have been favored. The earliest period of human presence in Sahul was an era of interactions and gene flow between related but already differentiated groups, from whom all modern New Guineans, Bismarck islanders and Indigenous Australians descend. The settlement of New Guinea was probably initiated from its southeast region, where the oldest archaeological sites have been found. This was followed by two migrations into the south and north lowlands that ultimately reached the west and east highlands. We also identify ancient gene flows between populations in New Guinea, Australia, East Indonesia and the Bismarck Archipelago, emphasizing the fact that the anthropological landscape during the early period of Sahul settlement was highly dynamic rather than the traditional view of extensive isolation.",Article,1 , Molecular Biology and Evolution,Aug 15,1,"

"Rock engravings and occupation sites in the Mount Bosavi Region, Papua New Guinea: Implications for our understanding of the human presence in the Southern Highlands","['Lara Lamb', 'Bryce Barker', 'Matthew Leavesley[...]', 'Tiina Manne']","en An extensive body of engraved rock art on the Great Papuan Plateau is documented here for the first time, along with the first dates for occupation. Consisting largely of deeply abraded or pecked barred ovals and cupules, the rock art of this region does not fit comfortably into any regional models for rock art previously described. It does, however, exhibit some similarity to art in regions to the east and the west of the plateau. Subject to further archaeological testing, we present a number of exploratory hypotheses with which to explain the presence of the engravings; as part of the ethnographic and contemporary Kasua's cultural suite; as part of a relatively recent (late Holocene) migration of peoples from the Gulf to the plateau; or as part of an earlier movement of people from the west, possibly as part of the movement of people into the Sahul continent in the Late Pleistocene. We conclude that the Great Papuan Plateau is not a late and marginally occupied ‘backwater’ but rather part of a possible corridor of human movement across northern Sahul and a region that could allow us to better understand modern humans as they reached the Sahul continent.

Criminal careers and restorative justice,['Sarah Bennett'],"In 2004, the Justice Research Consortium (JRC) completed a randomised controlled trial testing the crime reduction effects of restorative justice conferences. Burglary and robbery offenders and victims who agreed to participate in the trial were randomly assigned to either a face to face conference (experimental) in addition to normal court processing or to a control condition where their case proceeded as usual through London's Crown Courts. Restorative justice has been shown to be effective at reducing reoffending in some contexts. More research is needed, however, to determine why some individuals taking part in restorative justice desist from offending whilst others reoffend quickly. Research suggests that individual characteristics such as gender, race and age, criminal history features such as frequency, seriousness, and custody, and ancillary factors such as drug use and victimization can have an impact on offending, and this thesis investigates the extent to which these variables predict time to reoffending. Using survival analysis, this thesis also explores whether, in a sample of serious adult offenders, the effects of restorative justice on time to reoffending are different at different values of these variables. Key findings include: o In the burglary experiment, female offenders reoffended significantly faster than males, and females in the control condition reoffended twice as fast as females in the experimental condition. o The higher the frequency of arrests or convictions, and/or the greater the seriousness of offending prior to random assignment, the faster project offenders reoffended. This effect was significant in the burglary experiment. o Highly frequent and highly serious offenders (based on criminal history prior to random a

The use of the push/pull distinction has been one way in which scholars have aimed to provide clarity to the process of radicalization and extremist disengagement. However, it remains a conceptually underdeveloped distinction. In this paper, we draw on aspects of criminological theory to better understand the push and pull distinction. The paper draws on research comprising interviews with three Indonesians and two Australian individuals who have radicalized to violent extremism that is aligned with jihadist ideologies. Based on this primary data, case descriptions and narratives are provided on each individual examining pathways into and away from violent extremism. We draw on aspects of strain theory, social control, differential association, and desistance theory to understand common patterns across each case and to highlight the relative influence of various push and pull factors. Implications for theory and policy are highlighted. We also acknowledge limitations in our approach.",Article,,,Aug 3,0,"

Wright, Nicole Boivin and Alison Crowther Published:28 July 2021https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.202341 Review history Abstract The human colonization of eastern Africa's near- and offshore islands was accompanied by the translocation of several domestic, wild and commensal fauna, many of which had long-term impacts on local environments. To better understand the timing and nature of the introduction of domesticated caprines (sheep and goat) to these islands, this study applied collagen peptide fingerprinting (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry or ZooMS) to archaeological remains from eight Iron Age sites, dating between ca 300 and 1000 CE, in the Zanzibar, Mafia and Comoros archipelagos. Where previous zooarchaeological analyses had identified caprine remains at four of these sites, this study identified goat at seven sites and sheep at three, demonstrating that caprines were more widespread than previously known. The ZooMS results support an introduction of goats to island eastern Africa from at least the seventh century CE, while sheep in our sample arrived one–two centuries later. Goats may have been preferred because, as browsers, they were better adapted to the islands' environments. The results allow for a more accurate understanding of early caprine husbandry in the study region and provide a critical archaeological baseli

‘I want to sleep at night as well’: Guilt and care in the making of agricultural credit markets,"['Zannie Langford', 'Alana Brekelmans', 'Geoffrey Alan Lawrence']","In the pastoral lands of Northern Australia, properties are typically very large and remote, and experience severe fluctuations in land values and unpredictable environmental patterns. Most pastoralists are financed by bank credit, which is an important tool for managing business development plans and responding to situations of drought and changes in market conditions. This credit is serviced by a small group of professional agri-finance bankers who often reside in the region and develop long-term relationships with their clients. In this chapter, we explore the role of these relationships between pastoral landholders and bankers in shaping and moderating credit markets. We show that these relationships are not only symptomatic but also generative of moral economies in agricultural credit markets. Our evidence suggests that relationship lending may not only increase access to credit during economic contractions, as has been previously reported, but may also decrease access to credit during economic expansions. These relationships mediate the effects of global capital markets on Northern Australian pastoralism, influencing patterns of financing in the region. This contributes to understandings of financialisation as assembled by a diverse range of work by both financial and non-financial actors, whose interactions contribute to and resist financialising patterns in often unpredictable ways. https://www.routledge.com/Markets-in-their-Place-Context-Culture-Finance/Prince-Henry-Morris-Gallagher-FitzHerbert/p/book/9780367273408",Preprint,,,Jul 26,0,"

Phenotypic differences between highlanders and lowlanders in Papua New Guinea,"['Mathilde André', 'Nicolas Brucato', 'Sébastien Plutniak[...]', 'Francois X Ricaut']","Objectives: Altitude is one of the most demanding environmental pressures for human populations. Highlanders from Asia, America and Africa have been shown to exhibit different biological adaptations, but Oceanian populations remain understudied [Woolcock et al., 1972; Cotes et al., 1974; Senn et al., 2010]. We tested the hypothesis that highlanders phenotypically differ from lowlanders in Papua New Guinea, as a result of inhabiting the highest mountains in Oceania for at least 20,000 years. Materials and methods: We collected data for 13 different phenotypes related to altitude for 162 Papua New Guineans living at high altitude (Mont Wilhelm, 2,300-2,700 m above sea level (a.s.l.) and low altitude (Daru, <100m a.s.l.). Multilinear regressions were performed to detect differences between highlanders and lowlanders for phenotypic measurements related to body proportions, pulmonary function, and the circulatory system. Results: Six phenotypes were significantly different between Papua New Guinean highlanders and lowlanders. Highlanders show shorter height (p-value = 0.001), smaller waist circumference (p-value = 0.002), larger Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) (p-value = 0.008), larger maximal (p-value = 3.20e -4) and minimal chest depth (p-value = 2.37e -5) and higher haemoglobin concentration (p-value = 3.36e -4). Discussion: Our study reports specific phenotypes in Papua New Guinean highlanders potentially related to altitude adaptation. Similar to other human groups adapted to high altitude, the evolutionary history of Papua New Guineans appears to have also followed an adaptive biological strategy for altitude.",Article,1 , PLoS ONE,Jul 25,1,"

Strong communities and justice practices in the Torres Strait Region,"['John Scott', 'Zoe Staines', 'James Morton']","This article examines crime prevention practices in the Torres Strait Region (TSR), where relatively low crime rates challenge the association of discrete Indigenous communities with crime ‘problems’ and also test other criminological assumptions around crime. Drawing on 27 interviews with justice professionals and social workers in the TSR, we account for the resilience of a ‘shame culture’ in the region, which provides for a high level of social integration and sustains crime prevention practices, such as cultural mediation. Thus, we argue that while economic indicators such as wealth and employment show high levels of disadvantage in the TSR, indicators of strong social capital provide an explanation for low crime rates. We conclude that social capital is translated into local crime prevention practices that are unique to the TSR and reinforce the importance of cultural continuity and autonomy.",Article,1 , Journal of Sociology,Jul 24,1,"

Automated Annotation of Cell Identities in Dense Cellular Images,"['Shivesh Chaudhary', 'Sol Ah Lee', 'Yueyi Li[...]', 'Hang Lu']","Assigning cell identities in dense image stacks is critical for many applications, for comparing data across animals and experiment conditions, and investigating properties of specific cells. Conventional methods are laborious, require experience, and could introduce bias. We present a generalizable framework based on Conditional Random Fields models for automatic cell identification. This approach searches for optimal arrangements of labels that maximally preserves prior knowledge such as geometrical relationships. The algorithm shows better accuracy and more robust handling of perturbations, e.g. missing cells and position variability, with both synthetic and experimental ground-truth data. The framework is generalizable across strains, imaging conditions, and easily builds and utilizes active data-driven atlases, which further improves accuracy. We demonstrate the utility in gene-expression pattern analysis, multi-cellular calcium imaging, and whole-brain imaging experiments. Thus, our framework is highly valuable to a wide variety of annotation scenarios including in zebrafish, Drosophila, hydra, and mouse brains.",Preprint,,,Jul 22,1,"

Graphical-model framework for automated annotation of cell identities in dense cellular images,"['Shivesh Chaudhary', 'Sol Ah Lee', 'Yueyi Li[...]', 'Hang Lu']","Although identifying cell names in dense image stacks is critical in analyzing functional whole-brain data enabling comparison across experiments, unbiased identification is very difficult, and relies heavily on researchers' experiences. Here we present a probabilistic-graphical-model framework, CRF_ID, based on Conditional Random Fields, for unbiased and automated cell identification. CRF_ID focuses on maximizing intrinsic similarity between shapes. Compared to existing methods, CRF_ID achieves higher accuracy on simulated and ground-truth experimental datasets, and better robustness against challenging noise conditions common in experimental data. CRF_ID can further boost accuracy by building atlases from annotated data in highly computationally efficient manner, and by easily adding new features (e.g. from new strains). We demonstrate cell annotation in C. elegans images across strains, animal orientations, and tasks including gene-expression localization, multi-cellular and whole-brain functional imaging experiments. Together, these successes demonstrate that unbiased cell annotation can facilitate biological discovery, and this approach may be valuable to annotation tasks for other systems.",Article,1 , eLife Sciences,,1,"

"Counter-terrorism measures and perceptions of police legitimacy: The importance Muslims place on procedural justice, representative bureaucracy, and bounded-authority concerns","['Mohammed M. Ali', 'Kristina Murphy', 'Adrian Cherney']","Engaging Muslims in counter-terrorism (CT) has proved challenging for police worldwide. Some research has focussed on the utility of police being procedurally just in their CT strategies to enhance their legitimacy and subsequent cooperation from Muslims. Despite the efficacy of procedural justice, however, some have argued that procedural justice scholarship is too narrowly focussed on how police treat citizens. Citizens’ concerns about police acting within the limits of appropriate power (i.e., “bounded-authority” concerns), as well as representativeness in policing (i.e., “representative bureaucracy”), can also influence citizens’ judgments of police legitimacy. This study explores how, when, and why procedural justice, bounded authority, and representation concerns shape Muslims’ perceptions of police CT measures and police legitimacy. Using focus group data from 104 Australian-Muslims, results revealed that CT measures that include Muslims as partners in terrorism prevention and those that draw on principles of procedural justice were perceived most favourably, and were seen to promote police legitimacy. Measures that were condemned were perceived as bounded-authority violations and damaged police legitimacy. Implications for theory and police practice are discussed.",Article,,,Jul 18,0,"

Franklin', 'Marisa Giorgi', 'Phillip Habgood[...]', 'Michael C.

This is the first rock art site to be recorded in Mithaka Country, which is in a part of Australia's sandy deserts where rock art is uncommon. Gilparrka Almira is placed within a broader social context by exploring its possible cultural connections with other sites and regions. Regional comparisons of the main motif type found that proportions decreased in all directions away from the site. Possible meanings for crescent imagery are then examined from ethnohistorical sources, indicating that crescent motifs may bear a range of “discontinuous” meanings that can be used in different contexts. It is suggested that crescent motifs may have moved/diffused across vast areas of the continent, following the north-south Lake Eyre Basin trade network, with Mithaka Country lying at its approximate centre, and other (east-west) trade routes, along the Dreaming tracks with which the trade routes are frequently associated. Motifs with “discontinuous” meaning ranges, like crescents, would have been particularly suitable for use in this scenario because of their ability to be readily incorporated into different social contexts.

Procedural justice scholars argue that people cooperate with police when they feel the police are just and fair because such treatment motivates identification with social categories that police represent. In this paper, we consider whether immigrants in Australia respond favourably to procedurally just treatment from police because it enhances their identification with both Australia and the police. Using survey data from 903 Vietnamese, Middle Eastern and British immigrants, we demonstrate an association between police procedural justice and both modes of identification. We also find that both identities mediate the relationship between procedural justice and cooperation.

Identifying marsupials from Australian archaeological sites: current methodological challenges and opportunities in zooarchaeological practice,"['Erin Mein', 'Tiina Manne']","en We review current zooarchaeological practice in Australia, identifying major research themes and key methodological gaps where opportunities exist for the development of Australian zooarchaeology as a discipline. We demonstrate that marsupial remains form a significant component of Australian zooarchaeological assemblages, yet high resolution taxonomic identification of these remains continues to prove challenging, owing to a combination of high species diversity and few resources which provide diagnostic criteria for discriminating morphologically similar, but ecologically variable taxa. The lack of robust protocols for discriminating marsupial taxa significantly impacts our ability to effectively integrate zooarchaeological data into broader narratives of Aboriginal colonisation, resilience and adaptation across Australia. Publication of identification protocols would help refine and standardise diagnostic criteria used between analysts, improve the methodological transparency of zooarchaeological analysis and provide resources for the training of a new generation of specialists. A range of opportunities currently exist, utilising qualitative and quantitative techniques, to significantly contribute towards the methodological robustness of zooarchaeological practice in Australia.

"Neighbourhood places, collective efficacy and crime: A longitudinal perspective","['Renee Zahnow', 'Jonathan Corcoran', 'Anthony Kimpton', 'Rebecca Wickes']","Neighbourhood places like shops, cafes and parks support a variety of social interactions ranging from the ephemeral to the intimate. Repeated interactions at neighbourhood places over time lay the foundation for the development of social cohesion and collective efficacy. In this study, we examine the proposition that changes in the presence or arrangement of neighbourhood places can destabilise social cohesion and collective efficacy, which has implications for crime. Using spatially integrated crime, social survey and parcel-level land-use classification data, we estimate mixed effects panel models predicting changes in theft and nuisance crimes across 147 Australian neighbourhoods. The findings are consistent with neighbourhood social control and crime opportunity theories. Neighbourhood development – indicated by fewer vacant properties and fewer industrial and agricultural sites – is associated with higher collective efficacy and less crime over time. Conversely, introducing more restaurants, transit stations and cinemas is associated with higher theft and nuisance over time regardless of neighbourhood collective efficacy. We argue that the addition of socially conducive places can leave neighbourhoods vulnerable to crime until new patterns of sociability emerge and collective efficacy develops.",Article,1 , Urban Studies,Jun 1,0,"

"What's the catch in who fishes? Fisherwomen's contributions to fisheries and food security in Marovo Lagoon, Solomon Islands","['Sheridan Rabbitt', 'Ian Lilley', 'Simon Albert', 'Ian R. Tibbetts']","Food security is arguably one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. With rapid globalisation, and the global population forecast to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, this problem will only intensify. Fresh fish is the primary source of animal protein for many nations, and this is particularly true for equatorial nations in the Pacific. As fish stocks strain under climate change and increasing fishing pressure, their decline and collapse is becoming a common story. Predicted changes in fish populations indicate that equatorial nations will likely bear the brunt of nutritional insecurity, and this is particularly likely for Pacific nations where agricultural land is limited [1]. Given global threats to fisheries, and their importance to village diets in the Pacific, it is critical that fisheries resources are well managed to ensure food security for future generations. We interviewed 87 women across three villages in Marovo Lagoon, Western Province, Solomon Islands about their role in fisheries and fishery-related activities within their communities.. Of the women interviewed, 80.7% indicated that they do fish or harvest invertebrates. 84.5% of fisherwomen were primarily targeting finfish, not invertebrates, and most women (59.4%) indicated that they harvested seafood solely to feed their families. Results from this study contribute to a growing body of literature highlighting the high involvement of women in small-scale fisheries, and their contributions to household food security. This knowledge broadens our understanding of fishery resource utilization in the Solomon Islands, and provides data for strengthening food security through improved fisheries management.",Article,9 , Marine Policy,,0,"

Assaults occur significantly less frequently in summer than in spring and there is a greater propensity for assaults to occur on weekends compared to weekdays. Neighborhood disadvantage, ethnic diversity, and the presence of risky facilities such bars, schools, or shops increased the propensity for assault above and beyond the effect of temperature.

Earliest known human burial in Africa,"['María Martinón-Torres', ""Francesco d'Errico"", 'Elena Santos[...]', 'Michael D. Petraglia']","The origin and evolution of hominin mortuary practices are topics of intense interest and debate1–3. Human burials dated to the Middle Stone Age (MSA) are exceedingly rare in Africa and unknown in East Africa1–6. Here we describe the partial skeleton of a roughly 2.5- to 3.0-year-old child dating to 78.3 ± 4.1 thousand years ago, which was recovered in the MSA layers of Panga ya Saidi (PYS), a cave site in the tropical upland coast of Kenya7,8. Recent excavations have revealed a pit feature containing a child in a flexed position. Geochemical, granulometric and micromorphological analyses of the burial pit content and encasing archaeological layers indicate that the pit was deliberately excavated. Taphonomical evidence, such as the strict articulation or good anatomical association of the skeletal elements and histological evidence of putrefaction, support the in-place decomposition of the fresh body. The presence of little or no displacement of the unstable joints during decomposition points to an interment in a filled space (grave earth), making the PYS finding the oldest known human burial in Africa. The morphological assessment of the partial skeleton is consistent with its assignment to Homo sapiens, although the preservation of some primitive features in the dentition supports increasing evidence for non-gradual assembly of modern traits during the emergence of our species. The PYS burial sheds light on how MSA populations interacted with the dead.",Article,1 , Nature,May 8,1,"

Mapping Income Inequality and Socioeconomic Segregation Across Melbourne Neighbourhoods,"['Michelle Sydes', 'Rebecca Wickes']","Despite enduring political rhetoric that promotes Australia as ‘the lucky country’ and ‘the land of the fair go’, recent decades have seen a noticeable increase in levels of income inequality. This growing economic divide has driven housing prices up and left lower-income families unable to access the housing market in inner-city locations. In contrast to other countries, Australia’s socioeconomic segregation does not overlap with ethnic segregation. Australia’s highly regulated immigration program has resulted in a relatively well-educated and employable foreign-born population who largely reside in middle-income neighbourhoods. These particularities make Australia an interesting context to explore patterns of socioeconomic segregation over time. In this chapter, we will utilise both traditional measures of segregation (such as the dissimilarity index) as well more spatialised measures (such as location quotients and Local Morans I ) to assess socioeconomic segregation at the local level. Drawing on four waves of census data (2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016), we explore how socioeconomic segregation has changed over time across nearly 500 neighbourhoods in Melbourne. We further examine the degree to which socioeconomic segregation aligns with ethnic segregation patterns and levels in this city. We find patterns of socioeconomic segregation remain relatively unchanging over time in Melbourne. Additionally, our findings highlight important differences in patterns and levels of socioeconomic and ethnic segregation in the Australian context.",Chapter,,,May 2,1,"

"Agri-food scholarship: Past, present and future contributions to Australasian rural sociology","['Kiah Smith', 'Geoffrey Lawrence']","The future of food and agriculture in Australasia will be defined by multiple social, economic, political and environmental tensions – with climate change and social inequalities playing a central role in the re-imagining of food systems in crisis. This article argues that rural sociology will continue to be well-served by the sociological research into the farming and food industries undertaken by antipodean scholars – especially those from Australia and New Zealand where agri-food scholarship has flourished. Analyses of the future dynamics of rural social/economic change, natural resource management (including land, water and minerals), new relations of work, labour and identity, emerging agricultural technologies, Indigenous and post-colonial politics, and food system governance will benefit from agri-food studies’ insights into agrarian transformation and governance, social and environmental sustainability, health and wellbeing, and the growth of resistance and alternatives.",Article,1 , Journal of Sociology,May 2,0,"

Financialization for Development? Asset Making on Indigenous Land in Remote Northern Australia,"['Zannie Langford', 'Geoffrey Lawrence', 'Kiah Smith']","Indigenous Australian landowners are increasingly seeking to develop agricultural production on their lands to improve the welfare and economic opportunities of their communities. This can require substantial capital input and, in the absence of enough government funding, Indigenous groups are turning to private investors. Development literature has explored private sector‐led and ‘financialized’ approaches to development at a macro level as something that is done to communities; however, less research has examined how remote communities themselves seek to develop their natural assets through partnerships with businesses and with global finance. This article examines the work being done to prepare land for external investment. It provides an example of emergent assetization processes being undertaken outside the financial sector, driven by social outcomes seemingly beyond the domain of shareholder value. Paradoxically, individuals engaged in these asset‐making processes may oppose the withdrawal of direct funding for community development associated with a financialization of development, yet they are left with few options but to further these efforts by seeking private finance themselves — facilitating financialization for development. This interaction of structural effects and local agency complicates narratives of financialization as they are commonly presented and has important implications for Indigenous economic development in Northern Australia.",Article,1 , Development and Change,,0,"

Stochastic models support rapid peopling of Late Pleistocene Sahul,"['Corey J. A. Bradshaw', 'Kasih Norman', 'Sean Ulm[...]', 'Frédérik Saltré']","The peopling of Sahul (the combined continent of Australia and New Guinea) represents the earliest continental migration and settlement event of solely anatomically modern humans, but its patterns and ecological drivers remain largely conceptual in the current literature. We present an advanced stochastic-ecological model to test the relative support for scenarios describing where and when the first humans entered Sahul, and their most probable routes of early settlement. The model supports a dominant entry via the northwest Sahul Shelf first, potentially followed by a second entry through New Guinea, with initial entry most consistent with 50,000 or 75,000 years ago based on comparison with bias-corrected archaeological map layers. The model’s emergent properties predict that peopling of the entire continent occurred rapidly across all ecological environments within 156–208 human generations (4368–5599 years) and at a plausible rate of 0.71–0.92 km year−1. More broadly, our methods and approaches can readily inform other global migration debates, with results supporting an exit of anatomically modern humans from Africa 63,000–90,000 years ago, and the peopling of Eurasia in as little as 12,000–15,000 years via inland routes.",Article,1 , Nature Communications,May 1,1,"
