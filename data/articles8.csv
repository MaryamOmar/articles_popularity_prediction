The gendered politics of recognition and recognizability through political apology,['Emma Dolan'],"This article focuses on the performative recognition offered to victims through political apologies for conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV). It engages with understandings of political apology as an act of acknowledgment and moral visibility that has the capacity to further include marginalized accounts of violence or injustice within exclusive national histories/memberships. I introduce feminist understandings of visibility as ambivalent alongside a differential politics of “grievability” in order to suggest that political apologies must always recognize and make visible particular accounts of violence and subject positions; however, they simultaneously obscure others. I problematize the gendered and gendering effects of this process in relation to two cases of apology for CRSV: the Japanese imperial “comfort women” and the US Abu Ghraib torture scandal during the Global War on Terror (GWoT).",Article,1 , Journal of Human Rights,Nov 11,0,"

Lone organizers: Opposition party-building in hostile places in Tanzania,['Dan Paget'],"I ask where African opposition parties organize. Party-building is communicative; it involves persuading people to become activists. The literature suggests that opposition parties organize where people are receptive to their messages and build outwards from there. I study Chadema’s opposition party-building through site-intensive fieldwork. Chadema organized primarily in such receptive areas, but also in four unreceptive constituencies. I use these deviant constituencies to refine the literature. Prior theory neglects the heterogeneity of party-building. I decompose party-building into three modes as follows: by touring leaders, branches and concentrating leaders. Concentrating leaders dedicate their organizing to single places. They employ small rallies which afford interactive, individualized and iterative communication. This personalized communication enables them to overcome initial unreceptiveness to their messages. I conclude that opposition parties can organize in unreceptive areas, but only through the personalized methods of these ‘lone organizers’. Altogether, I show how and through whom opposition parties organize in hostile environments.",Article,1 , Party Politics,Oct 29,1,"

Scotland and England’s colliding nationalisms: neoliberalism and the fracturing of the United Kingdom,['John Bone'],"This paper explores the growing divide between Scotland and England, a schism that was beginning to take form with Scottish devolution and which has grown exponentially since the Independence Referendum of 2014. The central argument presented in the paper is that renewed impetus for national distinction and self-determination in Scotland is best understood as one facet of a much wider popular disenchantment and growing restiveness with the trajectory of contemporary UK politics, culture and society that has found an outlet via a resurgent nationalist discourse and institutional framework. Analysis here is approached via the application of an original biosocial theory with the aim of presenting further insights into the underlying processes driving contemporary political instability. Moreover, it is argued that this scenario can be understood, and may shed light upon, the wider rise in nationalist and populist sentiment that is contributing to increasing political turbulence across Europe and beyond.",Article,1 , British Politics,Oct 2,0,"

Ferocious and Fragile: Egypt and the Myth of ‘Authoritarian Stability’,"['Gennaro Gervasio', 'Andrea Teti']","During the Arab Uprisings (or ‘Arab Spring’), the EU recognized that the populations in its ‘Southern Neighborhood’ had been marginalized politically and economically; that this produced instability in politics, economics, and security; and that EU policy needed to correct its previous mistake of equating authoritarian repression with stability. Unfortunately, the wrong lessons have been learned from the Uprisings: Europe’s Union and its most powerful states have returned to focusing ‘stability’ understood as a mere lack of change, and to believing that supporting violently authoritarian regimes is an acceptable ‘cost of doing business’ to keep migration in check and to counter terrorism in Europe’s ‘heartland’. After a brief review of the historical context within which Egypt’s current regime emerged, this contribution criticizes the orthodox analytical and policy narratives which represent Egypt as a ‘beacon of stability’ in a turbulent MENA Region, outlining an alternative view which highlights the structural causes of instability in regimes like Egypt’s. It then outlines this instability by noting Egypt’s own post-2013 track record on key domestic and regional issues. The chapter concludes by criticizing the way Western governments invoke the concept of ‘national interest’ to supporting al-Sisi’s (al-Sīsī) regime and those like it, noting that this approach reflects an inability to accept the evidence of the failure of authoritarian regimes to stabilize either internally or externally.",Chapter,,,Sep 22,0,"

Camelid Fleece and the Hidden Histories of Colors in the Andes,['Penelope Dransart'],"This article explores the significance of natural fleece colors that are often hidden by dyeing processes. The earliest domesticated alpacas and llamas probably resembled vicuñas and guanacos, their wild counterparts. By 3000 years ago, differences were beginning to emerge in the coats of alpacas and llamas. Dyers, spinners, and weavers learned to exploit these variations to complement and extend the range of possibilities offered through the use of dyed yarns. The evidence from the Siguas and Nasca cultural traditions considered here is both direct and indirect, taking into account textile remains and the depiction of camelids on ceramics. It indicates that all white camelids had emerged before c. AD 500. With Tiwanaku and Wari cultural expansion in the South-Central Andes and Central Andes, requirements for certain fleece types resulted in the production of greater quantities of white and black fleece. Tiwanaku tapestries typically have a dark ground against which reds, blues and blues resonate, with white and yellows providing accents. While some Wari textiles share this use of a dark ground, a considerable number of tapestries and tie-dyed textiles depended on the availability of white and beige to enable pinks, yellows, and other bright hues to shine. Flamingo pink, like millennial pink, became a Wari cultural signifier. To understand this phenomenon, the properties of fleece, including its undyed affordances, must be taken into account as well as the dyestuffs used to enhance the color range.",Article,,,Sep 3,0,"

Rediscovering the ‘Noble Savage’: The Rewilding Movement and the Re-Enchantment of the Scottish Highlands,['John Bone'],"This paper focuses on an exploration of an emerging and controversial trend in animal/environmental activism, the rewilding movement, and in particular issues arising from the identification of the Scottish Highlands as a suitable site for rewilding. The rewilding movement contrasts with traditional conservationism in asserting that environmental revitalisation is best achieved through returning designated rural areas to a state broadly approximating that which existed prior to large scale human intervention, as opposed to merely conserving existing plants and fauna. Moreover, a key aspect of this process involves the reintroduction of 'missing species', in the form of apex predators such as Lynx, Boar and Wolf, where the latter are suggested to play a critical role in restoring 'natural' environments, largely through predation to control the activities and numbers of ungulate species whose grazing inhibits the growth of woodland and, hence, the restoration of ecosystems. The paper addresses various political and socio-economic issues raised by proposals for rewilding in the Scottish Highlands, in terms of tensions with traditional conservationism and, not least, the challenges presented to policymakers and publics with respect to predatory species reintroduction, including perceptions of risk to livestock and, indeed, humans. With respect to the latter, more fundamental theoretical questions are also addressed, including the way in which discourses around rewilding have been constructed by both advocates and critics of this phenomenon.",Article,8 , Scottish Affairs,Aug 20,0,"

The Nature of Structure: A Biosocial Approach,['John Bone'],"This paper considers how developments within the neurosciences might be applied to advance sociologists' (and other social scientists') understanding of social selves and social processes and, importantly, why this might be a fruitful pursuit despite some residual reservations within the discipline. With respect to the latter, the argument presented is firstly approached by briefly reflecting upon sociologists' lingering reticence with respect to engagement with biology, albeit that there has been some softening of this position over the last decade or so. This piece asserts that overcoming remaining sociological reservations regarding the biological offers considerable potential, in terms of enhancing our theoretical models and understanding of aspects of the social world, potentially offering fresh insights with respect to some perennial issues and concepts. Here, an example of this potential is offered through a neurosociological reframing of the foundations of social structure and the rationalization of conduct.",Article,6 , Sociological Review,,0,"

"Neoliberal precarity and primalization : A biosocial perspective on the age of insecurity, injustice, and unreason",['John Bone'],"In light of the observed rise in social instability and populist politics that has emerged recently even in some of the world's oldest and presumed stable democracies, this paper reappraises the role of the neoliberal political and economic consensus in fermenting popular discontent. While this is very well trodden ground the paper approaches the issues from a wholly new direction, specifically addressing how exposure to the destabilizing conditions of the present can be seen to have negatively impacted on the neurological functioning of many of the disenchanted and distressed of the current era, generating chronic negative emotional arousal and an associated impact on the capacity for rational thought and conduct. This condition of mental and emotional fugue, it is argued, has also rendered growing numbers more susceptible to marginal and radicalizing discourses, largely extended and amplified via social media, and not least the emotionally charged overtures of populist politicians. Against a backdrop of increasing insecurity, transformative changes to work and living conditions precipitated by neoliberal policy and the digital revolution, together with the epochal crisis presented by the global pandemic, it is argued that the task of understanding the deep and fundamental causes of social and political fracture have rarely been more urgent.",Article,1 , British Journal of Sociology,Aug 19,0,"

Doing waki in San Pablo de Lípez: Reciprocity between the living and the dead,['Maggie Bolton'],"This article has two distinct but related themes. The first is the relationship between the living and the dead in Andean communities, illustrated through the ritual waki. In San Pablo de Lípez, the dead are associated with fertility and with the coming of the rains, but also require help from the living in the form of offerings of liquids and food. The term waki derives from the Andean vocabulary of reciprocal exchange, which is the second theme of the article. On the basis of historical, linguistic, and ethnographic evidence, it is argued that exchanges are of two types, one involving long-term relationships with an expectation of return, and the other short-term transactions in which a payment completes the deal. These do not coincide with nonmonetary and monetary exchanges. It is also argued that the vocabulary deriving from symmetrical reciprocal exchanges can be employed ideologically to mask the nature of unequal exchange relationships.",Article,2 , Anthropos: International Review of Anthropology and Linguistics,Aug 13,0,"

The fundamental foundation of cultural heritage is language. Words are the toolkit we use to label, categorise and define and, most importantly of all, to communicate. As ICME represents institution whose core mandate is to increase dialogue and cultural awareness it is crucial that we find ways to facilitate greater international communication. One way to do this it to widen the reach of the newsletter by establishing a global circulation and strengthening its role as a point of engagement that stretches beyond the English language community. It was for this reason that the ICME Board made the decision to translate the ICME newsletter into Spanish. We are now pleased to announce that the newsletter is also being translated into Arabic. We are exploring ways of further expanding the list of languages in which the newsletter will be available. In order to cover the cost of translation the ICME have reduced the frequency of the newsletter. It will now appear on a bi-annual basis.

Election Campaigns and Political Mobilisation (in Africa),['Dan Paget'],"Politicians mobilise people to vote by devising messages and imparting them to voters. Many studies examine electioneering through a framework that distinguishes between programmatic, clientelist and charismatic appeals. Few politicians appeal to people by adopting particular policy positions, the strict sense of ‘programmatic appeals’. However, almost all solicit peoples’ support by stressing their sincere intentions and their abilities to pursue uncontroversial aspects of government, otherwise known as ‘valence appeals’. Parties’ historic records and their locations in government or opposition affect which issues they can claim to own and which they stress in their campaigns. While public policy is all but ubiquitous in African electoral politics, so too is clientelism. Many politicians give voters gifts, in the form of favourable distributions of public service delivery, in-kind goods, and cash. However, few of these gifts constitute contingent exchanges of goods for votes. Instead, political largesse is used to flatter, to impress and to convince voters of politicians’ virtue. In this respect, public policy and clientelism frequently appear in African elections side-by-side. Studies of appeals order studies of political messages, and shed light on how electoral politics affects public policy. However, it also obscures. A separate canon of work studies political discourses in sub-Saharan Africa. One of the most-studied subjects in this strain of the literature is populism. African populisms have been conceived of by some as discourses that unite disparate groups against an elite, and as an electoral strategy that draws together particular constituencies by others. Whichever definition one takes, African populists are rare. Only a

Tanzania: Shrinking Space and Opposition Protest,['Dan Paget'],"Since 2015, Tanzania has taken a severe authoritarian turn, accompanied by rising civil disobedience. In the process, it has become a focal point in debates about development and dictatorship. This article contends that Tanzania is undergoing a struggle over its democratic institutions, which is rooted in rising competition within the party system. However, the experience gained through local political contests in Zanzibar have also influenced how government and opposition interact on the national stage. The lessons of Zanzibari politics have helped to produce a nationwide political struggle that, rather than centering exclusively on questions of election process and management, is also focused on the laws that govern freedom of expression.",Article,7 , Journal of Democracy,,0,"

The Rally-Intensive Campaign: A Distinct Form of Electioneering in Sub-Saharan Africa and Beyond,['Dan Paget'],"I consider how to characterize and classify election campaigns in sub-Saharan Africa. I revisit the typology proposed by Pippa Norris, which distinguishes between premodern, modern, and postmodern campaigns. This typology, and others like it, homogenizes ground campaigns. Ground campaigns only feature by virtue of their centrality in premodern campaigns and their peripherality in modern and postmodern campaigns. I argue that the prominence of the rally varies across ground campaigns. By trivializing rallies, current typologies obscure this variation between African campaigns and between campaigns in sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world. To accommodate these differences, I propose a schema of campaign ecologies, adapted from Norris’ own, which incorporates a distinct ideal-type: the rally-intensive campaign. This revision internationalizes this hitherto Western-bound typology and may illuminate the features of campaigns in other middle- and low-income countries too. Equally, it throws into relief differences between historic premodern campaigns in Western countries. I contend that rally-intensiveness is a definitive feature of election campaigns from which other features stem. To illuminate such typical features, I study Tanzania, which has the most rally-intensive campaigns in Africa. I draw on ethnographic research and original survey data to identify the four following typical features of the rally-intensive campaign. Local as well as national leaders hold rallies frequently. Local rallies are better attended in aggregate than national ones, and accordingly, campaign contact is direct. Mass meetings dwarf the canvass as a means of campaign contact, and local party networks concentrate their efforts on “producing” rallies.",Article,9 , The International Journal of Press/Politics,,1,"

The authoritarian origins of well-organized opposition parties: The rise of Chadema in Tanzania,['Dan Paget'],"This article concerns the organizational expansion undertaken by the opposition party, Chadema, in Tanzania between 2003 and 2015. It argues that Chadema’s extensive party-building enabled it to mobilize on the ground. These organizational developments, as much as elite action, underpinned recent changes in the party system and the opposition’s improved showing in recent elections. Chadema established branches even though many of the prerequisite circumstances typically recognized in the literature were absent. This makes Chadema a deviant case and this deviance has implications for the historical institutionalist literature on party-building. This article complicates Rachel Riedl’s account of state substitution. She links the incorporation or substitution of social actors to different paths of party system institutionalization. This article demonstrates that the character and consequences of state substitution depend upon the balance of power between state and social actors. It also builds on accounts by Adrienne LeBas and others that when social actors are strong, they can endow opposition parties with resources which make branch establishment possible, and when they are weak, they can only act as surrogate party branches. This article illustrates that when social actors are absent from partisan politics, parties have no way to organize except by founding green-site branches.",Article,9 , African Affairs,Jul 30,0,"

"Again, making Tanzania great: Magufuli’s restorationist developmental nationalism",['Dan Paget'],"This article is about how ideologies legitimize authoritarianism. The literature argues that liberation nationalists discursively construct “liberation” as an ongoing struggle and justify their authoritarian rule until its completion. By recurrently postponing liberation, they extend this justification of authoritarianism. Nonetheless, their claim that the nation is part-way through liberation becomes less plausible over time. Liberation nationalism shares a discursive structure with a parallel class of developmental nationalisms. I analyse the ideology of President Magufuli and CCM in Tanzania. Instead of claiming that the nation is mid-transformation, they constructed the status quo as a corrupt deviation from a past order: “Nyerere’s Tanzania”. They conceived of this past order as a nation dedicated to industrial development which would lead to a transformed future. They advocated rupture with the present, the restoration of the past and the resumption of this transformative journey. Restorationism relieves liberation and developmental nationalisms of the rising rhetorical challenge of claiming that the nation has been on a transformative path since liberation. Therefore, Magufuli and CCM developed a variant upon liberation and developmental nationalisms, which also justifies authoritarianism. Unlike them, it remains rhetorically viable as the moment of liberation or development becomes distant. I call it restorationist developmental nationalism.",Article,0 , Democratization,,0,"

For the authors of Stereotypes and Prejudice in Conflict: Representations of Arabs in Israeli Jewish Society, years of research have culminated in a publication that unflinchingly explores such diverse topics as delegitimization tactics and unity as well as the development of perceptions among pre-schoolers. Daniel Bar-Tal, a professor in Tel Aviv University’s Psychology Department, is the author of several notable works on the issue, including Social Psychology of Intergroup Conflict (Springer-Verlag: 1998) and How Children Understand War and Peace (Jossey Bass: 1999). Likewise, Yona Teichman, a clinical psychologist at Tel Aviv University, brings a level of expertise honed from extensive research on the development and application of an implicit, free-response measure of social representations based on the systematic analysis of human figure drawings. Through this dynamic, they strive to contribute to future peace endeavors by prompting the critical analysis of one’s own society and the processes that impede conflict resolution, while encouraging new perspectives that will end the violent cycles that sustain conflict. From a strong opening chapter, the authors negotiate through twelve chapters adeptly, the most notable of which include chapter 4, “Representation of Arabs in Public Discourse”; chapter 5, “Representation of Arabs in School Textbooks”; and chapter 10, “Studies with Schoolchildren, Adolescents, and Young Adults.” All of these chapters are supported by a plethora of tables comprising generali

"Book Review: Jordanian Jerusalem: Holy Places and National Spaces By Kimberly Katz (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2005. 214 pages.)",['Luisa Gandolfo'],"For centuries, Jerusalem has been revered as the holy site of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam; strategically coveted as a means to consolidate territorial gains; and conquered thirty-seven times between its foundation and the sequestering of its ancient hub by Israeli forces during the Six-Day War. As the region underwent significant change after World War II, the Holy City increasingly became contested. While the Palestinians nurtured concerns regarding land sales and the escalating influx of Jewish settlers, their apprehension became lost amidst the tussle for authority between Transjordan, which sought to affirm its role as custodian of the holy places, and the nascent state of Israel, which strove to strengthen its presence in the city. Charting the endeavors of KingAbdullah and KingHussein to assert Transjordan’s authority over Jerusalemdespite international and Israeli rivalry, Katz affords a unique insight into the multifarious means used to court its residents through events, banknotes, and stamps between 1948 and 1967. Over the course of seven chapters, the author imbues the text with illuminating figures and maps. Most notable is the 1946 “Palestinian Aid” stamp series initiated during the Bludan Conference in June 1946, during which Abdullah directed member states of the Arab League “to issue a Palestinian stamp whose revenue would be earmarked for Palestine” (p. 56). Yet Abdullah’s pro-active stance – the Jordanian Parliament implemented the Arab League resolution on 22 July 1946, followed by the “Additional Stamps Law” Temporary Law 20 of the same year – was ultimately marred by his series of surreptitious meetings with the JewishAgency. Despite this duplicity, the merit of stamps in preserving stable relations with the Palestinians is

If the conversion story is told in the new light of the new discourse-brought about by the conversion-how can the sociologist use it to explain the conversion and the factors that led to it? We consider the extent to which the sociology of religion has conflated the necessary elements of narrative structure for the stages of conversion. Taking into consideration more recent research, the paper makes a case for careful and comparative sociological study of conversion narratives-considered as narrative accounts. I argue that doing so further opens up avenues for research, particularly if we consider the audiences for whom the stories are told and the purposes the stories serve, and a ultimately constitutes a sound basis for considering the processes of conversion themselves.",Preprint,,,Jun 1,0,"

Transitional Justice in Sri Lanka: Exploration and Analysis,['Ross Donachie'],"The conflict in Sri Lanka left the country with an unresolved legacy of gross human rights abuses and a lack of justice for victims. Transitional justice provides a toolkit to facilitate change through truth seeking measures, reparations, memorialisation initiatives and institutional reform. Through an understanding of the nature and conclusion of the Sri Lankan civil war and the manner in which transitional justice mechanisms have been subsequently implemented it is possible to gain insight into the state of justice for victims of human rights abuses in the country. After examining the progress of transitional justice in Sri Lanka it is clear that there continues to be significant barriers to the implementation of transitional justice initiatives in Sri Lanka originating substantially from the reluctance of the Sinhala-Buddhist majoritarian state to affect institutional change or acknowledge its role in past abuses. Further political instability has the potential to produce additional barriers to transitional justice, and may even reverse the process.",Thesis,,,May 4,0,"

U.S. Efforts to Thwart North Korea’s Nuclear Proliferation - Scrutinising and Explaining Strategic Failure,['Ross Donachie'],"This dissertation discusses and analyses the various approaches taken by successive Presidential administrations of the United States in attempting to denuclearize the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and their respective failings. Each administration has had to deal with the problem of a nuclear North Korea, and yet despite the U.S.’s unparalleled resources and military might is has been unable to prevent the DPRK from developing nuclear weapons or subsequently bring about denuclearization. In its attempts the U.S has employed differing forms of diplomacy, offered economic inducements, pursued harsh sanctions and used conventional and nuclear posturing to influence the DPRK. None of the methods used have been successful. Domestic constraints, naiveite and geopolitical realities have all contributed to this failure.

The prominence of Hamas and the process of Islamization in the West Bank and Gaza are having repercussions on both a local and a regional level, while politics, faith, and nationalism have created a mélange of ideologies.As secularist squares up to Islamist, andHamas and Islamic Jihad vie with the Palestinian Liberation Organization, the objective of the Palestinian struggle becomes trampled in the haste to draw support to either political group.

The Palestinian political identity is in a state of flux, and Islam’s dominant role in Palestinian society can no longer be ignored or dismissed. The emergence of Loren D. Lybarger’s Identity and Religion in Palestine is, then, a timely publication, as it provides a perceptive analysis of political identities in the Occupied Territories. Through his debut publication, Lybarger draws on interviews and experiences gathered during volunteer work with the Mennonite Central Committee in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. Conducted over a period of six years – three in the 1980s in theWest Bank, two in Gaza in the early 1990s, and one in the West Bank and Gaza from 1999 to 2000 – the author breathes life into accounts of the evolving Palestinian political identity by rendering his respondents’ dilemmas, vulnerabilities, hopes, and fears with startling clarity. By incorporating a plethora of political factions, religious communities, age groups, geographical locations, and socio-economic classes, he cogently assesses the Palestinian political and religious ident

"Book Review: Stolen Youth: The Politics of Israel’s Detention of Palestinian Children By Catherine Cook, Adam Hanieh, and Adah Kay (London and Sterling, VA: Pluto Press, in association with Defence for Children International: Palestine Section, 2004. 197 pages.)",['Luisa Gandolfo'],"The subject of child detention is fraught with complexities of both a legal and an emotional nature, particularly when placed in the context of conflict. Founded on the Defence for Children International: Palestine Section’s (DCI/PS) work conducted between 1999 and 2003, the contributors developed a level of expertise in the realm of youth detention in Israeli prisons through research, advocacy work, and the experiences of their colleagues, many of whom were former child detainees. The result is a compelling and often disquieting read, replete with testimonies by the children, their families, and lawyers which relates the unforgiving conditions and obstacles that clutter the legal process and place the child at a disadvantage. Edifying and cogent, the authors maintain an objective narrative throughout, thereby enabling the reader to absorb the circumstances and legal framework prior to constructing an independent conclusion. In addition, the tables, graphs, and figures corroborate and clarify such subjects as Israeli position abuse (shabeh), the characteristics of prisons, and key terms related to human rights and humanitarian law, as well as a glossary that provides background information concerning the noted organizations, statutes, and terminologies ...",Article,6 , American Journal of Islam and Society,,0,"

"Book Review: Suicide in Palestine: Narratives of Despair By Nadia Taysir Dabbagh (Northampton, MA: Olive Branch Press, 2005. 265 pages.)",['Luisa Gandolfo'],"Within the context of Islamic thought, suicide has met both tolerance and resistance and has spawned two cultural categories: suicide and martyrdom. Nadia Taysir Dabbagh approaches the issue with a dexterity honed by medical experience, and her insightful analysis of the two concepts reveals that suicide is perceived as a private act condemned by society and religion, while martyrdom is a public act exalted for the greater good. The fusion of theories plucked from psychiatry, anthropology, and psychology and then coupled with compelling case studies conducted in Ramallah and Gaza creates a coverage that treads the line between objective analysis and morbid fascination, as her research contributes a reasoned account of a startling trend largely lost in a region immersed in its tumultuous past and present and uncertain future. This book is the product of an intercalated M.B.–Ph.D. program submitted to the Psychiatry Department at University College London. The introductory chapter incorporates an elucidated methodology that identifies biological, social, and psychological study approaches, with the primary system of analysis resting on the latter. This person-centred technique perceives suicide as an individual phenomenon linked to risk factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, and stressful life events) and associations. Likewise, the social approach favors a broader angle and associates suicide with such social conditions as unemployment, domestic violence, and sociopolitical protest. The biological approach draws a correlation between affective disorders, such as bipolar disorder, and suicide. Eminent suicidologists, such as Michael Kral, Silvia S. Canetto, and David Lester, who assert that suicidal behavior should be placed in it

"Book Review: A Concise History of the Middle East, 8th ed.: By Arthur Goldschmidt Jr. and Lawrence Davidson (Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, 2006. 559 pages.)",['Luisa Gandolfo'],"In a discipline rich in studies addressing the multifarious aspects of the Middle East, a publication exploring the region’s history fromthe pre-Islamic period to the present confronts a fervent contest in establishing itself as a notable work. As the authors of A Concise History of the Middle East indicate from the outset, the challenge of conveying the relevance of past events to contemporary affairs is both complex yet essential. For Arthur Goldschmidt Jr. and Lawrence Davidson, the course is well-worn, as their publication enters its eighth edition since 1979.With a plethora of maps depicting the transitory regional borders dating from the Byzantine period to the present day, alongside cogent depictions of the Hashemite lineage and the Ottoman sultans and a piquant narrative, Goldschmidt and Davidson provide an account that proves – although directed toward undergraduate students and neophytes to the Middle East – a satisfying meander through regional triumphs and despairs over the course of twenty-one chapters. Consigned as “a dreary bore, a dead subject suited only to cranks, antique-lovers, or perhaps a few students seeking bits of small talk with which to impress their peers” (p. 2), the authors grapple with the waning allure of history in contemporary society in their introduction. Aware of the limitations, the opening chapter strives to rouse the reader with a swift assessment of the Middle East’s global contributions to language, religion, philosophy, mathematics, and science.Avoiding the plaintive plea to comprehend the origins of the current conflicts, the authors combine drollness with facts to ensure that the narrative does not falter and reiterate poignant questions throughout the publication, such as: “AsAmericans, who may at times ...",Article,8 , American Journal of Islam and Society,,0,"

"Book Review: Unity in Diversity: Interfaith Dialogue in the Middle East By Mohammed Abu-Nimer, Amal I. Khoury, and Emily Welty (Washington, DC: United States Institute of Peace Press, 2007. 285 pages.)",['Luisa Gandolfo'],"The field of conflict resolution has rarely been tested so frequently as in the Middle East. Since 1948, internecine conflict has flared in Israel/Palestine, Lebanon, and Iraq, with neighboring states sustaining the consequences of the tensions.Applying interfaith dialogue (IFD) as ameans to promote peaceful relations is thus, by its very nature, fraught with controversy and uncertainty. Yet this unique approach draws on peace-building mechanisms that bear such religious nuances as reconciliation, mercy, and forgiveness. By eschewing secular concepts for religious resources, IFD provides a point from which individuals can transcend the religious divide in search of further understanding and peace.Accordingly, following the activities of IFD organizations in Israel/Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, and Lebanon is a complex undertaking for the authors of Unity in Diversity. Having previously addressed Nonviolence and Peacebuilding in Islam: Theory and Practice (University Press of Florida: 2003) and Dialogue, Conflict Resolution, and Change: Arab-Jewish Encounters in Israel (State University of New York Press: 1999), Abu-Nimer, an associate professor with the International Peace and Conflict Resolution Program, lends a revealing insight into faith-based resolution. Alongside Khoury and Welty, this book introduces IDF and analyzes its application, limitations, and recommendations.

From Authoritarian to Free State: Balancing Faith and Politics in Tunisia,['Luisa Gandolfo'],"Discourses on the Arab revolutions have, to date, focused on regime change and its implications for future democratization in the region. This essay explores the impetus behind the religiopolitical tensions in Tunisia and posits that to grasp the events unfolding since 2010 the unrest must be located within an understanding of the dynamic between the Islamists and the state under President Habib Bourguiba and, later, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The essay revisits the terms revolutionary and revolution within the Tunisian context and reflects on the application of the label revolutionary , contending that the act of selective labeling bears implications for an objective understanding of the revolution and its actors. Finally, the essay evaluates how far the political tensions of the past continue to mark the present through the subsequent generation of religious movements emerging from the revolution.",Article,5 , Mediterranean Quarterly,Apr 1,1,"

"Transactions, space and Otherness: borders and boundaries in Palestine–Israel",['Luisa Gandolfo'],"In the context of conflict narratives, boundaries, borders and borderlanders serve as facilitators or inhibitors of peace. In Palestine–Israel, demarcation is enacted through the separation wall, the Green Line and the smart fence along the Gaza Strip. To the established boundaries, informal demarcations are added, running through the land and communities physically, in the case of Firing Zone 918, and ideologically through Othering and transactions in the zones of transition. This article considers Othering and the negotiation of space in the context of (un)official boundaries in the West Bank and deconstructs the intersection of culture, politics and place, as well as the boundary practices enacted by the state, community and the individual. First, the article distinguishes between the types of borders and boundaries in the West Bank, before considering the manner in which Otherness is practiced in the context of movement and the separation wall, as residents negotiate the transition through and around the barrier. From Othering in the transition zone, the study questions how far the experiences of Palestinians and Israelis correlate with the broader border/boundary discourse, the extent to which negative reciprocity is practiced at the checkpoints, and whether subliminal boundaries and (re)naming influences stability in the region.",Article,6 , Journal of Cultural Geography,,1,"

Material mnemonics and competing narratives in Palestine-Israel,['Luisa Gandolfo'],"Since 1948 the re-designation of depopulated Palestinian villages as national parks has evoked Lippet’s “cartography of nowhere”, as ruins and unmarked sites are subsumed in the process of material forgetting. Juxtaposing narratives and material mnemonics, this article assumes the villages of Deir Yassin, Suba, Kufr Bir’im and Iqrit as case studies to determine the extent to which memory infuses ruins with the ability to counter contemporary narratives. The article subsequently explores the use of debris in the sustenance of national memory, and questions how far “haunting” the land through commemorative tours and in situ story-telling renders the ruins noeuds de mémoire, as opposed to lieux de mémoire. Finally, the transition of the ruins from sites of history to sites of activism is charted through the use of theatre and technology that draw on the past and present as forms of cultural resistance.",Article,6 , Social Semiotics,,1,"

Navigating Trust and Distrust in the Refugee Community of Malta,['Luisa Gandolfo'],"This article considers how trust is constructed in the refugee community of Malta, against the backdrop of ongoing and recurrent unrest in Libya. As social trust is re-evaluated, social spaces have become sites of tension where divisions re-emerge along political, ideological, and economic lines. By focusing on the Libyan diaspora, the article presents an insight into the ways that conflict trauma shapes trust-building, and considers the challenges faced by civil society organisations and government bodies in their efforts to facilitate support and community-building on the island. The article is based on 14 interviews conducted in 2015 with members of the Libyan diaspora, and Maltese civil society organisations and government bodies. The interviewees discussed the multifaceted aspects of trust-building, including the legacy of 42 years of political distrust during the regime of the former Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, regional affiliations and divisions, and the continuum of trauma that unfolds in the Maltese Open Centres and in the host community. The findings of the study indicate that there are additional structural impediments that extend beyond the ongoing conflict, including the Maltese detention process, the redrawing of political boundaries around social spaces in the towns, and the role of identity, which present determining factors in the building of social trust. Collectively, these aspects hold implications for integration into the diaspora community on the island, while in the long term, individual recovery from conflict trauma is dependent on the trust-networks that are constructed, or joined, by the refugees.",Article,1 , Journal of International Migration and Integration / Revue de l integration et de la migration internationale,Apr 1,0,"

Presuming religious congruence? The Nonreligious and Catholicism in Poland,['Marta Trzebiatowska'],"This article contributes to the understanding of the symbiotic relationship between the nonreligious and the religious in religiously homogenous cultures. Specifically, it examines the centrality of the religious congruence fallacy in the narratives of nonreligious people. Based on 60 qualitative interviews with Polish nones, I chart the ways in which they make sense of the dominant model of Polish-Catholic religiosity, commonly referred to as the ""Polak-Katolik"". The findings demonstrate that nonreligious Poles equate Polish Catholicism with hypocrisy, conformity, and an implicit fear of ostracism. In conclusion, I suggest that it is vital that scholars of nonreligion flesh out the complexities of the relationship between the nones and the religiously homogenous cultures within which they exist.",Article,1 , Social Compass,Mar 30,0,"

Introduction: Absence and Trauma in Post-Conflict Memorialisation,"['Olivette Otele', 'Luisa Gandolfo', 'Yoav Galai']","In his poem, B-Movie (1981), Gil Scott-Heron reflected on the election of Ronald Reagan. He wrote, ‘this country wants nostalgia. They want to go back as far as they can. Even if it’s only as far as last week. Not to face now or tomorrow, but to face backwards’ (ibid.). Reagan ran under the slogan ‘Let’s make America great again’, which was later revived by Donald Trump, albeit truncated into the shorter ‘MAGA’. As we are increasingly seeing, ‘they’ are still waiting for a greater future to be imported from the imagined past, and not only in America. When Reagan was elected, it was a time of crisis, with stagflation running amok and a sitting president that wavered in the face of a hostage crisis.",Chapter,,,Mar 15,0,"

"Post-Conflict Memorialization Missing Memorials, Absent Bodies: Missing Memorials, Absent Bodies","['Olivette Otele', 'Luisa Gandolfo', 'Yoav Galai']","As the world negotiates immense loss and questions of how to memorialize, the contributions in this volume evaluate the role of culture as a means to promote reconciliation, either between formerly warring parties, perpetrators and survivors, governments and communities, or within the self. Post-Conflict Memorialization: Missing Memorials, Absent Bodies reflects on a distinct aspect of mourning work: the possibility to move towards recovery, while in a period of grief, waiting, silence, or erasure. Drawing on ethnographic data and archival material from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Argentina, Palestine, Israel, Wales, Peru, Colombia, Hungary, Chile, Pakistan, and India, the authors analyze how memorialization and commemoration is practiced by communities who have experienced trauma and violence, while in the absence of memorials, mutual acknowledgement, and the bodies of the missing. This timely volume will appeal to undergraduate and postgraduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and scholars with an interest in memory studies, sociology, history, politics, conflict, and peace studies Olivette Otele is Professor of Colonial History and Memory of Slavery at the University of Bristol, in the United Kingdom, and a Fellow and Vice President of the Royal Historical Society.

"Absence, Gender, and the Land(Scape) in Palestinian Art",['Luisa Gandolfo'],"Since the early twentieth century, the Palestinian landscape has passed through social, political, and economic changes that have brought displacement, the fall of old towns, and the rise of new ones. This chapter reflects on the extent to which the landscape provides a medium to address resistance, as well as commemoration, in the absence of the villages and their inhabitants. To do this, the chapter looks at how gendered representations of the land have shifted since 1948 to the present day with reference to the works of Sophie Halaby (1906–1998), Tamam Al-Akhal (1935–), Mona Hatoum (1952–), Emily Jacir (1970–), and Sama Alshaibi (1973–). In doing so, it traces the movement from the inferred gendering of the land through vistas devoid of people, to the recurrent image of Palestinian womanhood, and finally, the tangible female body as represented through photography and audio-visual pieces.",Chapter,,,,0,"

"Christians, Muslims and Traditional Worshippers in Nigeria: Estimating the Relative Proportions from Eleven Nationally Representative Social Surveys",['Andrew Mckinnon'],"Background The absence of census data on religious identification in Nigeria since 1963 leaves much uncertainty about the most basic religious composition of the country. It is generally accepted that identification with traditional worship declined over the middle of the twentieth century as identification with Islam and Christianity increased, leaving these the two dominant religious groups in the country. The current relative proportions of Christians and Muslims has often been the subject of conjecture, guesswork and assertion, as have trajectories of growth or decline. Purpose Where researchers have used sound data to address this question, they have often drawn on a single survey, or, if on multiple data sources, it is unclear how the different estimates the data provides are reconciled. This paper seeks to address these gaps to construct a better picture of the religious composition of Nigeria, and to consider the trajectory of change. Methods This study presents data from 11 nationally representative surveys of adults conducted between 1990 and 2018. Surveys include four waves of the World Values Survey, five waves of the Afrobarometer survey, The Pew Tolerance and Tension survey, and the Nigerian General Household Survey of 2010. Results The results show that identification with Christianity is likely to have been the majority among Nigerian adults through this period. Evidence suggests that identification with Christianity was still growing in the first half of the 1990s, to a high point of 69% of the adult population. This growth was associated with the tail of the decline of identification with traditional worship. Thereafter identification with Christianity has declined in proportional terms as identification with Isla

"When the Winds Run with the Earth: Cannibal Winds and Climate Disruption in Isluga, Northern Chile","['Penelope Dransart', 'Marietta Ortega']","This report uses a conceptual frame of “weather-worlding” to approach, in an atmospherically attuned manner, people’s knowledge concerning the formation and transformation of weather conditions. It explores observed patterning in winds and rains as a product of more than a single generation’s understanding. New ethnographic fieldwork findings from Isluga, northern Chile, are juxtaposed with information from notes made during previous periods of fieldwork the authors have conducted since the late 1970s and the 1980s. Comparisons with other anthropologists’ findings, seventeenth-century dictionary entries, and meteorological explanations are used to deepen the historical context for how people talk about winds, rain, and weather disruptions. While their observations of rainfall patterns concur with meteorologically collected data in important aspects, their accounts of disruptions to weather patterns provide a vivid portrayal of the winds’ unpredictable power to prevent precipitation from falling during the rainy season. People’s sensorial experiences of the winds emphasize the nonvisual, audible character of the elements, and our research participants personify bitterly cold westerlies as unruly, disruptive cannibal brothers. The text of this report coalesces round the themes of living in an arid land shaped by winds and what happens when the seasons are disrupted in a ceaselessly wind-blown atmosphere.",Article,1 , Current Anthropology,Feb 17,0,"

The Refugee Crisis through the Lens of Biopolitics: Comparative Analysis of Refugees' Marginalization in the Greek Camp and their Political Empowerment in the Squatted Building,['Sofia Pesiou'],"Abstract My thesis examines the various levels of refugees’ political empowerment or exclusion from decision making processes in two distinct physical spaces; the refugee camp and the squatted house. In the light of Foucauldian and Agambeian biopolitical theory about diminishing of life to bare existence and under the influence of Judith Butler and Guy Standing about vulnerability and precariousness of modern mobile refugee and migrant, I examine three relocation camps in Northern Greece and three squats in the city centre of Thessaloniki as to the opportunities they offer to refugees for political participation and representation, the power dynamics with non-government and civil society organizations and the effect that anti-systemic groups may have on their future political presence. I necessarily engage in a discussion about the role of care regimes in cases of humanitarian crises and I observe the power dynamics among all the various bodies in a camp as well as the relationships of refugees, activists and anarchists in a squat. It is a qualitative research that employs elements from ethnography as well as Glasser and Strauss’ grounded theory. The drawn conclusion affirm a tendency for the refugee to be silenced, often excluded from negotiation table and being treated as a child or victim in bigger relocation camps while in smaller settlements they are largely guided by civil society movements. In contrast, life in a squat, engagement in social activities and interaction with local activists appears to empower refugees significantly more than life in camps in addition to orienting them to claim their rights of political participation and self-management. My thesis highlights the importance of taking biopolitical theory into seri
