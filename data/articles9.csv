"The Influence of Financial Knowledge, Financial Socialization, Financial Behaviour, and Financial Strain on Young Adults' Financial Well-Being","['Mohamad Fazli Sabri', 'Husniyah Abd. Rahim', 'Amirah shazana Magli[...]', 'Siti Shazwani Ahmad Suhaimi']","Financial well-being refers to one's overall satisfaction with their current financial condition, and it plays a significant part in young adults' overall success as well as their ability to overcome psychological health concerns. It has become a crucial concern for individuals, households, societies, and countries in recent years, yet research on the subject is sparse and dispersed among fields. As a result, the current research assessed an empirical financial well-being model based on Malaysian young adults' financial knowledge, financial socialization, financial behavior and financial strain. A multi stage random sampling method was performed to draw a representative sample of Malaysian young adults, and 651 duly filled responses were received through the self-administered questionnaire. As stated by the multiple regression results, 16.1% of the total variance of financial well-being was clarified by the model. All four financial well-being determinants examined (financial knowledge, financial socialization, financial behavior, financial strain) were revealed significant, and only financial strain had a negative relationship with financial well-being. Therefore, current study has both the theoretical and practical contributions, and offers experts with actionable insights regarding the determinants of young adults' financial well-being when designing policies to uplift their financial well-being over time.",Article,,,Dec 14,0,"

"Influence of Financial Behavior, Financial Stress and Locus of Control on Financial Well-Being among B40 Households in Selangor During the Pandemic","['Amirah shazana Magli', 'Mohamad Fazli Sabri', 'Husniyah Abd. Rahim', 'mohd amim Othman']","Economic disadvantage disproportionately affects B40 households with income shocks. This paper aims to analyse the effects of financial well-being on 428 respondents from B40 households in Selangor districts using non-probability sampling (purposive stratified sample). SPSS Version 26 was used to perform regression analyses to determine factors influencing financial behaviour, financial stress, and locus of control. The fitness of the financial well-being model indicated an R-square value of 0.386. The model explained 38.6 per cent of the variances in financial well-being. Financial well-being was explained by the model's factors comprising financial behaviour, financial stress, internal and external locus of control. Model indicated (F = 65.70; p = .000) were valid models based on the ANOVA output. Financial behaviour and internal locus of control were shown to positively impact financial well-being; whereby financial stress was negatively influencing financial well-being. Financial stress occurs when a person's financial resources are insufficient to meet basic financial needs. Henceforth, those under a lot of financial stress must engage in proper financial activities to be more financially independent. In conclusion, ensuring responsible practices, including excellent financial behaviour practices, strong financial stress management, and high internal locus of control strengthened would assist households in completing their financial management.",Article,,,,0,"

Review of The Factor Influencing and Measurements of Financial Well-Being,"['Amirah shazana Magli', 'Mohamad Fazli Sabri', 'Husniyah Abd. Rahim']","Various indicators have been used to analyse the financial well-being of households during the last few decades (i.e. household income, financial debt, economic, social, financial health, and psychology). Financial well-being, on the other hand, cannot be quantified just on the basis of these few characteristics. It encompasses a variety of factors that influence financial well-being. Thus, this study will examine both objective and subjective qualities, or both subjectively or objectively traits, that contribute to the definition of financial well-being in three selected developed, developing, and underdeveloped countries. The authors conduct a systematic review of the literature (SLR) to inform future research on financial well-being. Identifying prior conceptualisations and definitions of financial well-being was the primary goal of this systemic literature review. Next, the second goal was ascertaining factors that influence financial well-being in three distinct nations. These countries were divided into three categories: developed, developing, and underdeveloped countries. A systematic review enables a researcher to identify the most pertinent papers to address the study issue while minimising errors. As a result of the findings, a subjective method is recognised as a more inclusive technique than an objective approach for defining and measuring a complex and personal phenomenon such as financial well-being. This study is intended to stimulate scholars to continue developing knowledge to enable financial institutions to adopt proactive measures to improve financial well-being.",Article,,,Dec 10,0,"

Discernment from the Youth Standpoint upon Young Leaderships in Politics: A Case Study in Malaysia,"['Bryan Nathen', 'Nur Shuhamin Nazuri', 'Siti Shazwani Ahmad Suhaimi[...]', 'Saiful Nujaimi Abdul Rahman']","In the earlier days of politics, youths were apathetic in the field of politics as the culture of politics was more suited to the older generation. This is because the older generation had more opportunities to cast partisan votes and developed stronger affiliations to the party for which they voted. However, with the ability to access information and engage online for everyone, this heterogeneous culture has given Malaysian youths a new and tangible existence in the scene of politics. Therefore, the purposes of this study is to explore the issues faced by youths in politics, how can aspiring politicians communicate effectively with youths today and to understand how does political communication work in youth circles. The study interviewed fifteen respondents, which all of them were university students between the ages of 18 and 35. The data collection strategy was an in-depth interview followed by a semi-structured interview protocol. Through the thematic analysis, this study found that there are still barriers surrounding politics, which are age, experience, and general perception between old and new politicians, including education, which seems to be a recurring topic. Furthermore, this research also spotted out that females do not have a significant share of voice in politics. This has concluded that the youth political environment remains an undeveloped area in Malaysia.",Article,,,Dec 7,0,"

Applying the Nominal Group Technique for Specifying the Interacting Dimensions Affecting Adherence to Post–Sharps Injury Follow-Up Services,"['Abdullah Aliff Abdul Wahab', 'Rosnah Ismail', 'Asnarulkhadi Abu Samah[...]', 'Halim Ismail']","Scale of adherence to post–sharps injury follow-up services among healthcare workers is uncommon compared to medication adherence scale. To develop a novel and culturally adapted scale, stakeholders should be consulted to specify dimensions by deducing it from the existing framework. This study was to demonstrate how health stakeholders were consulted to specify the dimensions. This study employed two sessions of Nominal Group Technique. Each session consisted of 12 purposive-sampled mixed participants i.e., healthcare managers and providers. A four-step sequential protocol was used for collecting participants’ key ideas on what adherence factors in post–sharps injury follow-up services: silent idea generation, round-robin collection, idea clarification, and ranking. Similar ideas were clustered and coded with an appropriate group theme and categorized it into subdimensions. Results: A total of 116 key ideas, yielding 13 and 10 themes in session 1 and 2, respectively. Those themes were coded into 16 sub-dimensions affecting adherence. They were distributed under five emerged dimensions in decreasing order of relative importance: (a) healthcare team and system-related factors; (b) patient-related factors; (c) therapy-related factors; and (d) condition-related factors. These findings guide researchers in developing culturally adapted items for measuring the level of adherence to post–sharps injury follow-up services.",Article,1 , Qualitative Report,Nov 26,0,"

A Systematic Review on Adaptation Practices in Aquaculture towards Climate Change Impacts,"['Asnarulkhadi Abu Samah', 'Hayrol Azril Mohamed Shaffril', 'Mohd Fauzi Fadzil[...]', 'Khairuddin Idris']","The impact of climate change is one of the many challenges faced by aquaculture communities nowadays. Only a limited number of articles have attempted to systematically review available literature in this field, which has led to the current study, aiming to develop a systematic review related to the practice of adapting to climate change among aquaculture communities. This systematic review was guided by the PRISMA Statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) in its systematic searching strategy on Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, resulting in the selection of 20 related studies. All selected articles were assessed using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Employing thematic analysis, five main themes resulted, namely Governmental (five subthemes), Community (three subthemes), Facilities (five subthemes), Temperature (two subthemes) and Financial (three subthemes), along with 18 subthemes. Based on the pattern of previous studies, the review presented several recommendations for scholars, agencies, and communities to consider in future.",Article,1 , Sustainability,Oct 20,1,"
