Myths about Myths? A Commentary on Thomas (2020) and the Question of Jury Rape Myth Acceptance,"['Ellen Daly', 'Olivia Smith', 'Hannah Bows[...]', 'Dominic Willmott']","This commentary responds to claims that research by Cheryl Thomas 'shows' no problem with rape myths in English and Welsh juries. We critique the claim on the basis of ambiguous survey design, a false distinction between 'real' jurors and other research participants, the conflation of attitudes in relation to abstract versus applied rape myths, and misleading interpretation of the data. Ultimately, we call for a balanced appraisal of individual studies by contextualising them against the wider literature.",Article,2021.0, Journal of Gender-Based Violence,6d ago,1,"

A direct observation of pain scale use in five video-recorded palliative care consultations: Using conversation analysis to show how practitioners support patients to describe pain,"['Laura Jenkins', 'Ruth H Parry', 'Christina Faull']","Objective Assessing pain intensity is an important palliative care task. Self-report pain intensity scales are frequently used within assessment. In contrast to formal studies of validity and reliability, we examine administration of, and responses to these scales in everyday palliative care. Methods We searched episodes of pain scale use in a dataset of (video/audio-recorded) UK palliative care consultations involving five doctors, 37 terminally ill patients and their companions. We found five, and applied the techniques and tools of conversation analysis to characterise scales’ administration and functioning. Results Generally, the patients responded to scales by reporting multiple aspects of pain; the doctors supported and encouraged this. In two episodes, the scales generated misunderstandings. The doctors worked to resolve these in ways that avoided implying the patient was at fault. Conclusion Pain intensity scales can yield richer information than just intensity. They can also generate misunderstandings and social friction which take skill and effort to resolve. Practice Implications Patients tend to respond to pain intensity scales by reporting on multiple aspects of pain, professionals should support them in this. These scales sometimes generate misunderstandings. To preserve the therapeutic relationship, professionals should work to resolve these without implying the patient is to blame.",Article,2021.0, Patient Education and Counseling,Oct 28,0,"

The Cold Truth: Art as Fulcrum for Recovery in Participants and for Civic Change,['Eloise Malone'],"This article describes art curating with sexually exploited young people. It reviews The Cold Truth: an exhibition produced by CSE survivors at Radiant Gallery, Plymouth, UK, 2016. The article proposes that the quality of the art produced by young people can catalyse social and civic change through public engagement and service commissioner adoption; and a pathway to psychosocial recovery for participants. It examines the transformative power of the art object created during the intervention. The article draws on Frogett et al’s “Aesthetic Third” to propose artwork as a fulcrum between silenced children, and communities which avoid unpalatable truths. It proposes that artworks eliciting empathetic responses are more powerful than those stimulating sympathetic responses. It offers Matarasso’s indicators of great art as language to consider the quality of art created by children, and to advocate that service leaders and commissioners use quality art processes to design and deliver effective services.",Article,2017.0, Journal of Social Work Practice,Oct 25,0,"

Dispositional Mindfulness Reduces Burnout and Promotes Flourishing in Medical Students: a Two-Wave Latent Change Score Model,"['Denisse Zúñiga', 'Manuel Torres-Sahli', 'Attilio Rigotti[...]', 'Marcela Bitran']","Objectives Many studies document the high prevalence of burnout among medical students. This syndrome may lead to depression, suicidal ideation, and increased academic dropout. However, there is a scarcity of evidence-based interventions to prevent it. The aim of this longitudinal study was to identify factors that may reduce students’ burnout and foster their well-being, and upon which effective interventions can be developed.MethodsA total of 1,117 medical students from eight Chilean universities were asked to complete a set of validated scales in 2015 and 2 years later, in 2017. The measures included distress, burnout, positive mental health, academic engagement, and dispositional mindfulness. Using logistic regressions and a two-wave latent change score model, the predictive power of these variables on burnout and flourishing (an optimal state of mental health) was studied, as well as their covariance across time.ResultsIn total, 639 (57.2%) students answered the questionnaires in T1 and T2; 54.4% reported burnout in T1 and 56.2% in T2. Levels of dispositional mindfulness (the ability to pay attention to one’s sensations, thoughts, and emotions in everyday life) predicted lower probabilities of burning out at 2 years, whereas having experienced burnout in T1 doubled these odds. Dispositional mindfulness, academic engagement, and flourishing at T1 predicted greater odds of flourishing 2 years later, while depression decreased these odds.Conclusions Dispositional mindfulness was the most powerful predictive factor of students’ burnout and flourishing. As dispositional mindfulness can be nurtured through practice, incorporating mindfulness training into undergraduate medical programs may help reduce burnout a

Realtalk Evidence-Based Communication Training: Development of a Conversation Analysis-Based Intervention Designed to be Delivered by Clinical Trainers,"['Ruth H Parry', 'Becky Whittaker', 'Marco Pino[...]', 'Christina Faull']","BACKGROUND Communication skills training for professionals caring for people with life-limiting conditions is in demand. Evidence shows that transfer of skills into practice is limited. Training can be improved by building on in-depth evidence and reflecting the complexity of actual interactions. Scientific advances from direct observational ‘conversation analytic’ studies of conversations in healthcare and beyond provide this evidence, but the linguistic complexities are often inaccessible to clinical trainers. We address this dilemma via a novel training initiative, ‘RealTalk’, designed to support trainers by increasing the authenticity and evidence base of end-of-life communication training for health and social care staff and trainees. METHODS We conducted a development study to create a communication intervention for testing. In collaboration with stakeholders, we identified the rationale for the content and mode of delivery, converted research findings into an applied intervention, and tested and refined the intervention prior to launching the finished product. RESULTS Using a conversation analytic approach, we made and analysed video recordings of real-life palliative care consultations in a large UK hospice. We transformed our findings into preliminary training resources comprising clips from the video recordings and accompanying written materials. We shared the materials with an advisory group of clinicians, educators and researchers. Based on feedback, we modified the materials. Trainers in UK higher education institutions, healthcare organisations and independent hospices piloted our materials within their own training and fed back. Further modifications followed in readiness for evaluation of acceptability, usability and effects

Does the platform matter? Social media and COVID-19 conspiracy theory beliefs in 17 countries,"['Yannis Theocharis', 'Ana Cardenal', 'Soyeon Jin[...]', 'Václav Štětka']","While the role of social media in the spread of conspiracy theories has received much attention, a key deficit in previous research is the lack of distinction between different types of platforms. This study places the role of social media affordances in facilitating the spread of conspiracy beliefs at the center of its enquiry. We examine the relationship between platform use and conspiracy theory beliefs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Relying on the concept of technological affordances, we theorize that variation across key features make some platforms more fertile places for conspiracy beliefs than others. Using data from a crossnational dataset based on a two-wave online survey conducted in 17 countries before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we show that Twitter has a negative effect on conspiracy beliefs—as opposed to all other platforms under examination which are found to have a positive effect.",Article,2021.0, New Media & Society,Oct 10,1,"

The Moral Career of a Suspected Legionary: Psychological Language in the Securitate Archives,"['Cristina Plamadeala', 'Cristian Tileaga']","This article explores some notable uses of psychological language in the Securitate archives. We examine Securitate files concerning Constantin Vaman, a suspected legionary subjected to surveillance work by the Securitate. This article seeks to show how Securitate activities, particularly the writing of informer notes and operatives’ reports, are the upshot of strategic use of morally implicative psychological language. Constantin Vaman’s Securitate files are used to explore two categories of psychological language: the language of mental states and the language of disposition and motive. We show that Securitate’s writing of informer notes and operatives’ reports were dependent on the strategic use of morally implicative psychological descriptions. We argue that close attention to the many facets of psychological language used in Securitate documents discussed in this article may enable researchers to understand more fully the complex nature and inner workings of surveillance work.",Article,2021.0, East European Politics & Societies,Oct 8,0,"

P66 Translation and validation of the swahili warwick edinburgh mental wellbeing scale (WEMWBS) and distribution of mental wellbeing in adolescents and adults taking part in the Girls’ Education Challenge project in Tanzania,"['Louise Banham', 'Elizabeth Bruno-McClung', 'Deus Kapinga[...]', 'Rebecca Willans']","Background The Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) is validated for measuring mental wellbeing in UK populations aged 11+ and has been translated into 30+ languages. The primary aim of this study was to translate and validate WEMWBS for use in Swahili-speaking populations. This will facilitate measurement and understanding of wellbeing in these populations, evaluation of policy and practice, and enable international comparisons. The secondary aim was to describe mental wellbeing in the participants of the Girls’ Education Challenge (GEC) project in Tanzania, run by CAMFED and funded through the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. Specifically, to examine sociodemographic characteristics associated with higher and lower wellbeing in this population. Methods We created a short questionnaire including WEMWBS and similar scales for comparison, socio-demographic information and self-reported health. This was translated into Swahili using gold standard methodology. We aimed to use this tool to collect data from secondary school students (girls and boys), learner guides, teacher mentors and teachers taking part in the GEC programme in Tanzania. Quantitative data analysis examined internal consistency of WEMWBS, correlation with comparator scales and confirmatory factor analysis. Qualitative work to assess acceptability and comprehensibility of WEMWBS and conceptual understanding of mental wellbeing was carried out through focus groups with GEC participants.

Childcare Use and Its Role in Indigenous Child Development: Evidence from the Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children in Australia,"['Francisco Azpitarte', 'Abraham Chigavazira', 'Guyonne Kalb[...]', 'Stephen R Zubrick']","We investigate patterns of childcare use and its influence on the cognitive development of Indigenous children. The influence of childcare on Indigenous children's cognitive outcomes is less well understood than for non‐Indigenous children due to a lack of appropriate data. We focus on a cohort of Indigenous children in Australia who have been followed from infancy and for whom rich information on childcare use and cognitive outcomes is observed. Compared to Indigenous children who never participated in childcare, Indigenous children who participated in childcare performed better on several early cognitive outcomes. Using regression and propensity score matching, we show that this difference is driven by selection into childcare, with children from more advantaged families being more likely to attend formal childcare. However, matching analysis results suggest that relatively disadvantaged children might benefit more from attending childcare, as indicated by the positive estimated effects found for those who never attended childcare.",Article,2018.0, Economic Record,,0,"

Correlates of hair cortisol concentrations in disadvantaged young children,"['Julian Guy Simmons', 'Francisco Azpitarte', 'Fatou Diallo Roost[...]', 'Nick Haslam']","Children from highly disadvantaged families tend to experience worse health, educational, and job outcomes than less disadvantaged peers. However, the mechanisms underlying these relationships remain to be explicated. In particular, few studies have investigated the relationships between the psychosocial influences that children are exposed to early in life, and longer‐term cortisol output. This study aims to contribute to the literature by exploring how disadvantaged young children's experiences of family adversity, and parenting and family functioning, are related to their long‐term cortisol levels. A sample of 60 children (26 males, M age=4.25 years, SD=1.68) and their mothers (M age=34.18 years, SD=7.11) from a low income population took part in a single assessment. Mothers completed questionnaires on the family environment, parenting practices, and child behavior. Children provided a hair sample for cortisol assay, and anthropometric measures. A parsimonious multivariate regression model (including potential predictors identified by a selection algorithm) was used to investigate the correlates of hair cortisol concentration (HCC) in children. Higher levels of social exclusion, being male, and younger age were each associated with higher HCC. Maternal nurturing and emotion coaching were associated with lower HCC. Findings suggest that chronic stress may underlie relationships between adversity and its long‐term effects, and that HCC offers a promising method for examining chronic stress in children and evaluating interventions by which it can be ameliorated.",Article,2019.0, Stress and Health,,0,"

Barriers and Factors Affecting E-commerce Utilization of Thai Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in Food and Beverage and Retail Services,"['Yot Amornkitvikai', 'Siew Yean Tham', 'Jiraporn Tangpoolcharoen']","E-commerce is deemed as the next potential source of growth for Thailand, but small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are still behind in their utilization of e-commerce. This article uses the decision-makers, technological, organizational and environmental (DTOE) framework to examine the key e-commerce barriers and determinants in e-commerce utilization by Thai SMEs based on a survey of retail and food and beverage (F&B) service establishments in metropolitan Bangkok. This study aims to fill the research gap by examining the types of barriers that hinder e-commerce utilization by Thai SMEs in the F&B and retail services, as well as their key determinants. Unlike e-commerce adoption, e-commerce utilization can capture the full range of e-commerce engagement. The survey’s findings indicate that organizational barriers significantly inhibit e-commerce utilization. Estimations from the structural equation modelling (SEM) show that exports, e-commerce tools, government support, and internal and external e-commerce platforms can enhance e-commerce utilization. In addition, business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce can increase the exports of Thai SMEs, while older entrepreneurs and SMEs tend to neglect e-commerce. Evidence-based policy implications and suggestions are also discussed in this study to enhance e-commerce utilization for Thai SMEs.",Article,2021.0, Global Business Review,Aug 30,0,"

Public libraries as reserves of cultural and digital capital: Addressing inequality through digitalization,"['Adrián Leguina', 'Sabina In Mihelj', 'John Downey']","Public libraries are among key sites for the acquisition of cultural capital, and possibly one of the most potent means through which the state can address inequality. While digitalization of public libraries already attracted significant scholarly attention, the evidence of its contribution to the acquisition of cultural skills and knowledge and social mobility remains limited, as does the conceptual understanding of links between digitalization, cultural capital, and social stratification. This article draws on two disconnected bodies of research, the sociological analysis of cultural capital and stratification and research on digital divides. To bridge these two bodies of research, the interplay of cultural and digital capital in public libraries was investigated. The extensive dataset from the UK Taking Part Survey (2016–17) was analyzed using two-step cluster analysis and multinomial regression models to explore the contrasting profiles of contemporary library users. Results identify four distinct user groups: Traditional, Active, Family, and Tech Access, which possess different degrees of cultural and digital capital, have different demographic profiles, and benefit from digitalized libraries in different ways. If libraries are to fulfil their role in reducing social inequalities, it is important that they tailor their digital services to the specific characteristics of each user group. This approach also provides a useful template for exploring the interplay of digitalization and (in)equality in other cultural institutions.",Article,2021.0, Library & Information Science Research,Aug 5,1,"

From occupational to existential class: How to analyze class structure in hybrid societies (The case of Serbia),"['Predrag Cveticanin', 'Inga Tomić-Koludrović', 'Mirko Petric[...]', 'Adrián Leguina']","In this article, we propose a model to analyze the class structure of hybrid post‐socialist societies in South‐East Europe (SEE), using the case of Serbia. We argue that, in such hybrid societies, social inequalities are generated by several mechanisms of similar strength: exploitative market mechanisms (based on economic capital) and different types of social closure mechanisms (based on political and social capital). Their influences are intertwined and cannot be analytically isolated or reduced to a common foundation. Therefore, occupational class analysis in these societies can have only limited explanatory power. In an attempt to overcome these challenges, we were forced to modify the instruments of several established approaches to class analysis. These modifications included (1) a reconceptualization of Bourdieusian notions of political, social, and cultural capital, (2) a different operationalization of social space, (3) identification of specific mechanisms of generating social inequalities, (4) paying attention to both practical and discursive classifications of lifestyles in the establishment of symbolic boundaries, and (5) relying on differential association analysis for identifying class boundaries. Our analysis's final result is a model that enables studying general social inequality, that is, generalized social advantage/disadvantage, in SEE post‐socialist societies.",Article,2021.0, British Journal of Sociology,Aug 3,0,"

Does a Crisis Change News Habits?

Based on the classical concept of ‘need for orientation’ and the literature on the role of the media in times of crisis, we investigate to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic affected news consumption in comparative perspective. Based on a two-wave panel survey in 17 mostly European countries, our study targets the role of both legacy news brands (TV, radio, newspapers) and so-called contemporary news media (Internet-based and social media) during this global health crisis. Our results show an overall rise of news use across countries, but only for some types of news media. We find an increase of TV news consumption, and a higher reliance on social media and the Internet for news and information. This indicates that in times of crises and an unusually strong need for orientation, people mainly turn to news sources that are easily available and offer a more immediate coverage. Furthermore, we find the rise in news use to be mainly present among those who already have a higher level of trust in legacy media and among people that were more concerned about the impact of the pandemic.",Article,2021.0, Digital Journalism,Aug 1,0,"

Analysing data from a large seven country survey of Internet use and adapting concepts and methods developed by Bourdieu, we show that there are distinct clusters of users who use the Internet in diverse ways to solve everyday problems, such as buying a mobile phone or diagnosing an illness. Such everyday problem-solving is dependent upon degrees of economic, social, digital and cultural capital, and varies across countries. A comparative methodological strategy combined the use of multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and for the first time in the field, multiple factor analysis for contingency tables (MFACTs). Extending the work of Bourdieu and the sociology of class more generally, we argue that digital capital functions as a bridging capital aiding the convertibility of other forms of capital to the benefit of already advantaged groups.",Article,2021.0, New Media & Society,Jul 29,1,"

Rethinking social capital in the desistance process: The ‘Artful Dodger’ complex,['Christopher Kay'],"Social capital has become a core component of our understanding of desistance in recent years. Some of this work, however, seems to present social capital as inherently positive, suggesting that increasing stocks in social capital is fundamental to the desistance process. Knowledge surrounding exactly how social capital is utilized within the desistance process, with the exception of acquiring social capital as a social good, remains underexplored. Through an analysis of the desistance narratives of young adult men serving community orders under the supervision of the probation service in England and Wales, this article argues that, instead of being considered to be inherently good, social capital is perhaps better thought of as value neutral, consisting of both positive and negative aspects (some of which occur simultaneously). Desistance, then, is not simply about obtaining social capital (because many people with convictions possess stocks of social capital that supported their offending); rather it is about reorienting the type of capital available to them at any given time, from relationships that imbue ‘anti-social capital’ to those that imbue ‘pro-social capital’. This distinction has significant theoretical and policy interventions, arguing that it is pro-social capital that the literature makes reference to in terms of supporting desistance efforts. The article concludes by offering some tentative suggestions for future research, along with ways in which this distinction can further support how we operationalize desistance within criminal justice policy and practice.",Article,2020.0, European Journal of Criminology,Jul 21,0,"

The impact of policy change on prisoner resettlement and community integration: A case of disproportionate response,['Christopher Kay'],"The involvement of prisoners on license in the recent London Bridge and Streatham, London attacks have triggered a series of policies aiming to restrict community release. These aim to address not only the point at which prisoners in England and Wales are released, but also the level of engagement prisoners can have with the community before release. They have been introduced with little consultation of the available evidence and, seemingly, with little consideration of those who will be directly impacted as a result of their implementation. This commentary considers how announced changes in policy relating to the use of Release on Temporary Licence (ROTL) with prisoners, represent a response which is not only disproportionate to the scale of the problem but may also negatively impact upon prisoner rehabilitation. It draws upon evidence surrounding the impact of early release and evidence surrounding the practices which work to promote desistance from crime to highlight the flaws in these new policies, but also the importance of maintaining community engagement in the rehabilitation of people with convictions.",Article,2020.0, Critical Social Policy,,0,"

Rethinking recovery and desistance processes: developing a social identity model of transition,"['Christopher Kay', 'Mark Monaghan']","Background: In recent years, the role of social identity (or identities which are developed through involvement in social groups with others), has received increasing attention in relation to recovery from substance abuse disorders. However, it is also widely noted that the transformation of one’s social identitie(s) is vital for the cessation of other, non-addictive behaviours, such as offending. Interestingly, the discussion of the role of social identity tansformation in relation to both desistance and recovery simultaneously has seldom been undertaken.Methods: Drawing on primary research consisting of 20 double narrative interviews with young adult offenders on an Intensive Community Order, the paper builds upon the two most prominent social identity models surrounding addictive behaviour, the Social Identity Model of Recovery and the Social Identity Model of Cessation Maintenance in order to develop a social identity model which aids our understanding of desistance and recovery processes.Results: The paper presents a Social Identity Model of Transition (SIMOT), allowing for the synergies between desistance and recovery as processes of transition to come to light.Conclusion: SIMOT allows for an understanding of the role of social identity transformation in the transient nature of desistance and recovery processes. The model allows for an examination of the impact of macro and micro contextual factors on desistance and recovery processes in a way which has seldom been possible with the currently available models.",Article,2018.0, Addiction Research and Theory,,0,"

Online Social Endorsement and Covid-19 Vaccine Hesitancy in the United Kingdom,"['Andrew Chadwick', 'Johannes Kaiser', 'Cristian Vaccari[...]', 'Li-Yuang Yu']","We explore the implications of online social endorsement for the Covid-19 vaccination program in the United Kingdom. Vaccine hesitancy is a long-standing problem, but it has assumed great urgency due to the pandemic. By early 2021, the United Kingdom had the world’s highest Covid-19 mortality per million of population. Our survey of a nationally representative sample of UK adults ( N = 5,114) measured socio-demographics, social and political attitudes, media diet for getting news about Covid-19, and intention to use social media and personal messaging apps to encourage or discourage vaccination against Covid-19. Cluster analysis identified six distinct media diet groups: news avoiders, mainstream/official news samplers, super seekers, omnivores, the social media dependent, and the TV dependent. We assessed whether these media diets, together with key attitudes, including Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy, conspiracy mentality, and the news-finds-me attitude (meaning giving less priority to active monitoring of news and relying more on one’s online networks of friends for information), predict the intention to encourage or discourage vaccination. Overall, super-seeker and omnivorous media diets are more likely than other media diets to be associated with the online encouragement of vaccination. Combinations of (a) news avoidance and high levels of the news-finds-me attitude and (b) social media dependence and high levels of conspiracy mentality are most likely to be associated with online discouragement of vaccination. In the direct statistical model, a TV-dependent media diet is more likely to be associated with online discouragement of vaccination, but the moderation model shows that a TV-dependent diet most strongly attenuates the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and discouraging vaccination. Our findings support public health communication based on four main methods. First, direct contact, through the post, workplace, or community structures, and through phone counseling via local health services, could reach the news avoiders. Second, TV public information advertisements should point to authoritative information sources, such as National Health Service (NHS) and other public health websites, which should then feature clear and simple ways for people to share material among their online social networks. Third, informative social media campaigns will provide super seekers with good resources to share, while also encouraging the social media dependent to browse away from social media platforms and visit reliable and authoritative online sources. Fourth, social media companies should expand and intensify their removal of vaccine disinformation and anti-vax accounts, and such efforts should be monitored by well-resourced, independent organizations.",Article,2021.0, Social Media + Society,Jul 15,1,"

From gateways to multilinear connections: A qualitative longitudinal investigation of the relationships between vaping and smoking among adolescent users,"['Jason Hughes', 'Grace Sykes', 'Kahryn Hughes[...]', 'Khalid Karim']","Background: The international growth of e-cigarette use has been accompanied by a corresponding concern that e-cigarettes will act as a 'gateway' to smoking and the use of other drugs. Taking these concerns as our point of departure, we explore the relationships between vaping and smoking among a cohort of young people. Methods: Qualitative longitudinal methods with a diverse sample of 36 14-18-year olds from the UK city of Leicester. A total of 66 depth interviews conducted across two phases separated by 6-12 months. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Findings: We highlight a complex 'tangle' of connections between substances/risk behaviours recounted to us by our adolescent study participants, including multiple and multilinear relationships between vaping and smoking. These findings problematise some of the core axioms of the notion of gateways as an explanatory model of causality and sequential connection between smoking and vaping. They also throw into question gateway logics more fundamentally. While many of our study participants themselves consciously invoked ideas of 'gateway effects', the accounts they produced repeatedly disrupted the logics of connection (between e-cigarettes and smoking; one set of behaviours and another) presupposed in gateway theory and our own early lines of questioning. Accordingly, we explore how cultural understandings of gateway effects are invoked by users in accounting for their vaping and smoking behaviours, noting the potential influence of these ideas upon the very processes they are understood to apprehend.

Mediating Class in a Classless Society? Media and Social Inequalities in Socialist Eastern Europe,['Sabina In Mihelj'],"It is tempting to assume that state socialist media abounded with idealised depictions of working-class citizens. Yet, while workers were indeed glorified in official rhetoric, popular media offered a rather different picture. Drawing on the analysis of television fiction from five state socialist countries, this chapter shows that miners, farmers and factory workers were often overshadowed by engineers, lawyers and public officials whose tastes, habits and aspirations appeared remarkably ‘middle class’. Such patterns of representation were rooted in persistent forms of social inequality that privileged the socialist ‘middle classes’ over citizens in blue-collar occupations.",Chapter,2021.0,,,0,"

Abstract TP125: Intracranial Stenosis Subtypes in Patients Aged 45 Years or Younger,"['Wei-Hai Xu', 'Yu-Yuan Xu', 'Mingli Li[...]', 'Shan Gao']","Objective: Using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging(HRMRI), we sought to examine the proportions of intracranial stenosis subtypes and their clinical relevance in young patients(≤45 years old). Methods: One hundred and twenty-nine consecutive patients (mean age 36±8 years) with middle cerebral artery stenosis and without Moyamoya disease were evaluated by HRMRI. The stenosis was classified as eccentric stenosis, concentric stenosis, and mixed stenosis if both eccentric and concentric stenosis occurred in one vessel. The clinical data and vessel wall properties were analyzed among the subtypes. Results: Eccentric stenosis was found in 86 (69.4%) patients, while concentric stenosis was found in 26 patients (21.0%) and mixed stenosis in 12(9.7%) patients. The patients with eccentric stenosis were older (p<0.001) and more likely had atherosclerosis risk factors (p=0.024). The patients with concentric stenosis were more likely female, and aged 35 years old or younger. All mixed stenosis were high-grade (>70%) stenotic. All concentric stenosis showed constrictive remodeling, while eccentric and mixed stenosis had heterogeneous remodeling types. In 34 patients with available enhanced images, ring enhancement was revealed in 8/9(88.9%) concentric stenosis and 5/5(100%) mixed stenosis, but only in 3/20(15%) eccentric stenosis (P<0.001). Ten of twelve (83.3%) patients with mixed stenosis were symptomatic, more frequently than the patients with eccentric stenosis (57.0%, p=0.072) and the patients with concentric stenosis (50%, p=0.052). Conclusions: The distinct vessel wall features among intracranial stenosis subtypes suggest heterogeneous pathophysiology. Further studies are required to i

Abstract 2786: Moyamoya Syndrome Associated With Graves' Disease: Report Of 16 Cases,"['Jun NI', 'Li-xin ZHOU', 'Yan-ping WEI[...]', 'Li-ying CUI']","Background and purpose Moyamoya disease is a cerebrovascular disorder characterized by bilateral progressive stenosis and occlusion of terminal portions of internal carotid artery (ICA) accompanying by typical net-like collateral vessels. Patients with both the characteristic moyamoya vasculopathy and the associated conditions are categorized as moyamoya syndrome. These conditions include sickle cell disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, Down’s disease, cranial therapeutic irradiation and other rare diseases. Moyamoya syndrome associated with Graves’ disease has been rarely reported and the underlying coexisting mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study is to identify the clinical and radiological findings of the patients with simultaneous diagnosis of moyamoya syndrome and Graves’ disease. Possible mechanisms predisposing these individuals to ischemic accidents are discussed. Methods We retrospectively identified 12 patients in Peking Union Medical College Hospital and 4 patients in 307 hospital of PLA between May 2000 and December 2010. All patients were female and mean age (range) was 35.13±12.34 years (11-57 years). The patients were diagnosed with Graves’ disease in endocrinology clinic which meet the full diagnostic criteria and no atherosclerotic factor was found in them. Moyamoya vasculopathy was definitely or probably diagnosed by digital subtract angiography or magnetic resonance angiography. The clinical characteristics and prognosis, laboratory data, vascular radiological characteristics were all collected.

Abstract T MP54: High-resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Intracranial Stenosis in Patients Younger Than 35 Years,"['Weihai Xu', 'Mingli Li', 'Shan Gao[...]', 'Li-Ying Cui']","Background: Using High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging(HRMRI), we aimed to investigate the etiology of intracranial stenosis in patients younger than 35 years. Methods: Fifty-four consecutive patients (mean age,29±6 years) with middle cerebral artery stenosis were evaluated by HRMRI. The morphology of artery lesions and clinical data were analyzed. Probable atherosclerotic plaques were diagnosed by the presence of eccentric wall thickening. Probable non-atherosclerotic lesions were diagnosed by the presence of concentric wall thickening and absence of plaques.On quantitative analysis, when constrictive remodeling can be identified by visual inspection, vessel shrinkage was defined. Results: Plaques were found in 32 (59%) patients, including 13 patients without any atherosclerosis risk factors. The patients with a plaque tended to be older (p=0.061), male (p=0.013), and more likely have atherosclerosis risk factors(59% vs. 23%, p=0.012), expansive artery remodeling (37.5% vs. 0,p<0.001), and infarctions (75% vs. 45%, p=0.044). The non-atherosclerotic lesions more often displayed vessel shrinkage (100% vs. 31%, p<0.001) and concentric wall enhancement (83% vs.13%, p<0.001). Conclusion: In this study, atherosclerosis accounted for a high percentage of intracranial artery stenosis in patients younger than 35 years when HRMRI was introduced into the diagnostic setting. Intracranial non-atherosclerotic stenosis has distinct vascular pathophysiology from atherosclerotic stenosis and is often free from stroke.",Article,2015.0, Stroke,,0,"

Greatly increased requests for digital (e.g. phones) and third party (e.g. school or mental health records) evidence from victim-survivors after the R Vs Allan case in 2017, had intensified victim-survivor scrutiny and reduced police charging and court summons to their current low. With sexual offences causing immense distress and harm to those victimized, and victim-survivors not having the confidence with the criminal justice system due to aggressive questioning, leaving them feeling as if they are on trial, it is perhaps not so surprising that few victim-survivors report to the police. The criminal justice system is not only failing victim-survivors, it is harming many of them. In previous publications we called for independent legal representation for victim-survivors to reduce the trauma associated with needless scrutiny of victim-survivor’s personal lives. Independent legal representation aims to provide legal support, aid, and advice to complainants in order to prevent aggressive and inappropriate questioning, help victim-survivors with data consent forms and also aims to prevent further damage to victim-survivors’ mental health. Whilst we welcome HM Government’s pledge to consult on and pilot access to legal advice to rape victim-survivors, this delays rolling out this service across England and Wales when there has already been an evaluation of such a service in England, the system is already proposed in Scotland, and Ireland already has independent legal representation, as does much of Europe.",Article,2021.0,,Jul 1,0,"

"Income, welfare, housing and the transition to higher order births in the UK","['Ann Berrington', 'Juliet Stone']","The UK shows relatively high levels of progression to higher order birth compared to the rest of Europe. It is often assumed that the means-tested benefits system has an indirect pronatalist effect for low-income families, but robust empirical evidence is lacking. We use household panel data from a large nationally representative study to examine the relationship between household income, receipt of welfare benefits, housing, and the probability of experiencing a second, third or fourth birth. Associations with income vary by parity and women’s age. High levels of child tax credit receipt are associated with an increased risk of third birth. Social housing shows a strong, positive association with third and fourth birth. Whilst demographic factors – particularly women’s age – remain the strongest predictor of parity progression, we provide new evidence to suggest that welfare receipt and housing circumstances contribute to explaining social polarisation in family size in the UK.",Article,2017.0,,Jun 23,1,"

The Low Income Gap: A New Indicator Based on a Minimum Income Standard,"['Donald Hirsch', 'Matt Padley', 'Juliet Stone', 'Laura Valadez-Martinez']","In many high-income countries, governments seek to ensure that households at least have sufficient incomes to afford basic essentials such as food and clothing, but also to help citizens reach socially acceptable living standards allowing full participation in society. Their success in doing so is commonly monitored in terms of how many citizens are below a poverty line set relative to median income, and by how far below it they fall (the ‘poverty gap’). Yet the threshold below which this gap starts to be measured is arbitrary, begging the question of what level of low income needs addressing. A more ambitious measure, presented in this paper, considers the extent to which people fall short of a benchmark representing a socially agreed minimum standard. This ‘low income gap’ can be used to represent the distance a society has to go to eliminate income that is undesirably low. The paper presents the indicator, its meaning and some recent trends in the United Kingdom, where the methodology behind the indicator has been pioneered. The results demonstrate that this empirically derived benchmark has the potential to be of value in other countries, in assessing whether they are making progress in reducing low income.",Article,2020.0, Social Indicators Research,,1,"

Understanding third and fourth births in Britain: What role do increased immigration and multiple partnerships play?,"['Ann Berrington', 'Juliet Stone']","The proportion of UK families with three or more children is high in European perspective. Commentators often assume that high rates of progression to third, fourth and higher order births result from the higher fertility of women who migrated to the UK from regions of the world where large families are common. Less attention has focused on the role of serial partnering where repartnered couples cement their commitment with a ‘shared child’. This paper provides new empirical evidence as to the relative importance of increased international migration and increased experience of multiple partnerships in fostering higher order births among British women now aged 45+ who were born 1940-1969. We conclude that migration from high fertility regions, and the experience of multiple partnerships are both associated with progression to third and fourth birth. However, the likelihood of going on to have a third or fourth birth has remained similar across these birth cohorts for women who were born in the UK (to UK-born parents), and those who have only been married once, suggesting that additional factors encourage large families in the UK.",Article,2017.0,,,0,"

Short-term ethnography and women’s voices: insights from fieldwork with Roma communities,"['Cristian Tileaga', 'Ana S. Popoviciu', 'Jo Aldridge']","In this paper, we explore the potential of short-term ethnography in a collaborative and participatory research project on experiences with and perceptions of migration from fieldwork with Roma groups in north-western Transylvania. We discuss particularly the challenges we encountered in engaging Roma women in terms of existing cultural and gender norms evident in some Roma communities. We argue that, in the context of working with women in patriarchal communities, short-term ethnography offers researchers a unique opportunity to (a) find and take advantage of safe spaces in which to talk to women and (b) manage sensitively access and rapport. In this study, ethnography gave insights into alternative ways of engagement in the research process based on categorisations that emphasise alternative aspects of social identity (Roma ‘mothers’ vs. Roma ‘women’) as an effective means of breaking down some of the barriers to participation. Finally, we argue that short-term ethnography can be used successfully in collaborative and participatory research projects alongside traditional ethnographic work to explore the perspectives of mobile and vulnerable or marginalised groups including, but not limited to, patriarchal group contexts.",Article,2021.0, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,Jun 21,0,"

The end of ‘Welcome Culture’? How the Cologne assaults reframed Germany’s immigration discourse,"['Iris Wigger', 'Alexander Yendell', 'David Herbert']","Controversy over immigration and integration intensified in German news media following Chancellor Merkel’s response to the refugee crisis of 2015. Using multidimensional scaling of word associations in reporting across four national news publications in conjunction with key event, moral panic and framing theories, we argue that reporting of events at Cologne station on New Year’s Eve 2015–2016 reframed debate away from terror-related concerns and towards anxieties about the sexual predation of dark-skinned males, thus racializing immigration coverage and resonating with a long history of Orientalist stereotyping. We further identify an increased clustering of ‘race’, gender, religion, crowd-threat and national belonging terms in reporting on sexual harassment incidents following Cologne, suggesting an increased criminalization of immigration discourse. The article provides new empirically based insights into the dynamics of news media reporting on migrants in Germany and contributes to scholarly debates on media framing of migrants, sexuality and crime.",Article,2021.0, European Journal of Communication,Jun 18,1,"

PHGDH Is Upregulated at Translational Level and Implicated in Platin-Resistant in Ovarian Cancer Cells,"['Fangfang Bi', 'Yuanyuan An', 'Tianshui Sun[...]', 'Qing Yang']","Background Platinum-based chemotherapy is the first line option for ovarian cancer. The development of resistance to such chemotherapy results in treatment failure, while the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.Methods Clinical samples were collected from Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University. MTT assay was used to see the proliferation and chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells. Transwell migration and Matrigel invasion assays was used to see the invasion ability of ovarian cancer cells. In addition, polysome profiling and tissue microarray and immunohistochemical staining were also used. The statistical significance of the difference was analyzed by ANOVA and post hoc Dunnett’s test.ResultsPHGDH is the first enzyme responsible for serine biosynthesis pathway. The current study demonstrated that PHGDH is upregulated in platin-resistant ovarian cancer cells and tissues at the protein level. Importantly, knockdown of PHGDH suppressed, while overexpression of PHGDH increased the survival upon cisplatin exposure, invasiveness and spheroid formation of ovarian cancer cells. The current study demonstrated that PHGDH translation was upregulated in platin-resistant ovarian cancer. In addition, our study provided evidence that LncRNA RMRP (RNA Component of Mitochondrial RNA Processing Endoribonuclease) was upregulated in platin-resistant ovarian cancer, which promoted enrichment of RNA binding protein DDX3X (DEAD-Box Helicase 3 X-Linked) on the PHGDH mRNA to promote its translation.Conclusion Collectively, the current study described that PHGDH was upregulated and conferred resistance of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin, suggesting that cisplatin resistance could be overcome

Using evidence from detailed ethnographic fieldwork, with musicians, festival organisers, tour operators, business owners and civil servants, this paper examines how issues such as geographical and social distance, internet connectivity, and cultural tourism are understood in relation to the musical life of Argyll and Bute. We advocate for greater ethnographic engagement with local communities in order to provide a more sophisticated, real-world understanding of rural cultural policy and the impact of current policies on local musicians. The paper therefore foregrounds ethnography as an important method in local, rural contexts such as Argyll and Bute, where typically, much of the creative economy is embedded in statistically invisible economic and cultural activity and portfolio employment.",Article,2021.0, Creative Industries Journal,Jun 4,1,"

Reduced burnout and higher mindfulness in medical students after a self-care program during the COVID-19 pandemic,"['Denisse Zúñiga', 'Manuel Torres-Sahli', 'Pía Nitsche[...]', 'Marcela Bitran']","Background: Medical students experience high levels of psychological stress during clinical training. However, most medical curricula do not teach self-care skills. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted medical education causing increased distress among students. Aim: To report the implementation and impact of an eight-week multifaceted mindfulness-based self-care program on medical students’ distress and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Methods: One hundred twenty-three fourth-year medical students attended the program as part of a mandatory course from April to May 2020, during the rising phase of COVID-19 in Chile. They were evaluated using validated tests before and immediately after the program. The measures included burnout, dispositional mindfulness, perceived stress, traumatic stress reactions, general well-being, resilience, and stress coping strategies. Results: Burnout prevalence decreased from 48% to 24%, whereas students with high dispositional mindfulness increased from 25% to 44%. Burnout reduction was mostly due to decreased emotional exhaustion. Additionally, students reported lower levels of stress, self-blaming, and traumatic stress reactions alongside an increased use of active coping strategies and resilience levels after the program. Conclusions: A formal educational intervention, teaching self-awareness and self-regulation skills can help reduce medical students’ distress and promote their well-being even amidst a pandemic.",Article,2021.0, Revista medica de Chile,Jun 1,1,"

Probation and Privatisation,['Philip Bean'],"Privatisation was introduced into the probation service on the 1st June 2014 whereby work with medium and low risk offenders went to a number of private and voluntary bodies, work with high risk offenders remained with the State. The National Probation Service (NPS) covered State work whilst the 35 existing Probation Trusts were replaced by 21 Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs). Staff were allocated to either side of the divide but all remained as probation officers. The effect was that the existing probation service lost control of all but 30,000 of the most high risk cases, with the other 220,000 low to medium risk offenders being farmed out to private firms. Privatisation was justified as the only available way of achieving important policy objectives of extending post release supervision to offenders on short sentences, a group who are the most prolific offenders with high reconviction rates yet who receive no statutory support. This book describes the process by which the probation service became privatised, assessing its impact on the probation service itself, and on the criminal justice system generally. It considers both the justifications for privatisation, as well as the criticisms of it, and asks to what extent the probation service can survive such changes, and what future it has as a service dedicated to the welfare of offenders. It demonstrates how the privatisation of probation can be seen as a trend away from traditional public service in criminal justice towards an emphasis on efficiency and cost effectiveness. This book is essential reading for criminology students engaged with criminal justice, social policy, probation, punishment and working with offenders.

"Audience Engagement with COVID-19 News: The Impact of Lockdown and Live Coverage, and the Role of Polarization","['Sabina In Mihelj', 'Katherine Kondor', 'Václav Štětka']","Existing research on media and the COVID-19 pandemic is largely based on quantitative data, focused on digital media, limited to single-country studies, and often West-centred. As such, it has limited capacity to provide a holistic account of the causes and consequences of audience engagement with COVID-19 news, or to consider the impact of systemic political and media factors. To compensate for that, we examine a large set of qualitative interviews and media diaries collected in four eastern European countries during the first wave of the pandemic. We show that changes in news consumption—including the resurgence of television and decline of print consumption—were not driven solely by audience demand for up-to-date information, but also by practical constrains of home-bound life in lockdown, and the introduction of live briefings. Our findings underscore disruption and uncertainty as key elements of audience experiences and highlight the markedly privatized and depoliticized nature of public debate in the early phase of the pandemic. We argue that the pandemic was an unpredictable, open-ended, and exhausting media event with high potential for divisiveness and polarization, especially in contexts marked by low levels of media freedom, declining democratic standards, and elite-led politicization of the crisis.",Article,2021.0, Journalism Studies,May 28,0,"

Rhetorical uses of precise numbers and semi-magical round numbers in political discourse about COVID-19: Examples from the government of the United Kingdom,['Michael Billig'],"This paper examines how the British government has used statistics about COVID-19 for political ends. A distinction is made between precise and round numbers. Historically, using round numbers to estimate the spread of disease gave way in the 19th century to the sort precise, but not necessarily accurate, statistics that are now being used to record COVID-19. However, round numbers have continued to exert rhetorical, ‘semi-magical’ power by simultaneously conveying both quantity and quality. This is demonstrated in examples from the British government’s claims about COVID-19. The paper illustrates how senior members of the UK government use ‘good’ round numbers to frame their COVID-19 goals and to announce apparent achievements. These round numbers can provide political incentives to manipulate the production of precise number; again examples from the UK government are given.",Article,2021.0, Discourse and Society,May 17,0,"

Navigating High-choice European Political Information Environments: A Comparative Analysis of News User Profiles and Political Knowledge,"['Laia Castro', 'Jesper Strömbäck', 'Frank Esser[...]', 'Yannis Theocharis']","The transition from low- to high-choice media environments has had far-reaching implications for citizens’ media use and its relationship with political knowledge. However, there is still a lack of comparative research on how citizens combine the usage of different media and how that is related to political knowledge. To fill this void, we use a unique cross-national survey about the online and offline media use habits of more than 28,000 individuals in 17 European countries. Our aim is to (i) profile different types of news consumers and (ii) understand how each user profile is linked to political knowledge acquisition. Our results show that five user profiles – news minimalists, social media news users, traditionalists, online news seekers, and hyper news consumers – can be identified, although the prevalence of these profiles varies across countries. Findings further show that both traditional and online-based news diets are correlated with higher political knowledge. However, online-based news use is more widespread in Southern Europe, where it is associated with lower levels of political knowledge than in Northern Europe. By focusing on news audiences, this study provides a comprehensive and fine-grained analysis of how contemporary European political information environments perform and contribute to an informed citizenry.",Article,2021.0, The International Journal of Press/Politics,May 14,1,"

Media diversity and the analysis of qualitative variation,"['David Deacon', 'James Stanyer']","Diversity is recognised as a significant criterion for appraising the democratic performance of media systems. This article begins by considering key conceptual debates that help differentiate types and levels of diversity. It then addresses a core methodological challenge in measuring diversity: how do we model statistical variation and difference when many measures of source and content diversity only attain the nominal level of measurement? We identify a range of obscure statistical indices developed in other fields that measure the strength of ‘qualitative variation’. Using original data, we compare the performance of five diversity indices and, on this basis, propose the creation of a more effective diversity average measure. The article concludes by outlining innovative strategies for drawing statistical inferences from these measures, using bootstrapping and permutation testing resampling.

Tolerance through Indifference: Autoreactive B Cells to the Nuclear Antigen La Show No Evidence of Tolerance in a Transgenic Model,"['Brett D Aplin', 'Catherine L Keech', 'Andrea L de Kauwe[...]', 'James McCluskey']","Systemic autoimmune diseases are characterized by the production of high titer autoantibodies specific for ubiquitous nuclear self-Ags such as DNA, Sm, and La (SS-B), so the normal mechanisms of B cell tolerance to disease-associated nuclear Ags have been of great interest. Mechanisms of B cell tolerance include deletion, anergy, developmental arrest, receptor editing, and B cell differentiation to the B-1 subtype. However, recent studies in our laboratory have suggested that B cell tolerance to the nuclear autoantigen La is limited in normal mice, and tolerance may reside primarily in the T cell compartment. To test this hypothesis, we created Ig transgenic mice expressing the IgM H chain from an mAb specific for a xenogeneic epitope within human La (hLa). These mice were bred with hLa-transgenic mice that constitutively express hLa in a manner comparable to endogenous mouse La. Between 5-15% of transgenic B cells developing in the absence of hLa were specific for hLa, and these cells were neither depleted nor developmentally arrested in the presence of endogenous hLa expression. Instead, these autoreactive B cells matured normally and differentiated into Ab-forming cells, capable of secreting high titer autoantibody. Additionally, the life span of autoreactive hLa-specific B cells was not reduced, and they were phenotypically and functionally indistinguishable from naive nonautoreactive hLa-specific B cells developing in the absence of hLa. Together these data suggest a lack of intrinsic B cell tolerance involving any known mechanisms indicating that these autoreactive B cells are indifferent to their autoantigen.",Article,2004.0, The Journal of Immunology,May 11,1,"

Methods Nine manufacturers of EIA kits to detect antibodies of defined specificities participated in a study in which they received coded sera from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These coded sera contained different dilutions of antibody of one specificity mixed with sera containing antibodies of other specificities. The manufacturers were asked to use their standard technology to determine antibody content and send the data to a committee of the International Union of Immunological Societies for analysis. The data were analyzed for sensitivity and specificity in the detection of anti–double‐stranded DNA (anti‐dsDNA), anti–single‐stranded DNA, antihistone, anti‐Sm, anti–U1 RNP, anti‐SSA/Ro, anti‐SSB/La, anti–Scl‐70 (DNA topoisomerase I), anticentromere, and anti–Jo‐1 antibodies. In addition, replicate samples were included in the coded sera to evaluate the precision of each EIA method. Results Lack of sensitivity and specificity was most evident in the anti‐dsDNA and anti‐Sm kits, although 2 kits for anti‐dsDNA achieved acceptable sensitivity and specificity. Generally, anti‐SSA/Ro, anti‐SSB/La, anti–Scl‐70, anticentromere, and anti–Jo‐1 kits performed well. Many false‐positive results were obtained with a multiple myeloma serum containing cryoprecipitates, but multiple myeloma sera without cryoprecipitates presented no problem in the EIA system.

The analysts were blinded to the concentration of the antibodies and the specificities. Initially, 11 manufacturers out of 20 agreed to participate, but 2 subsequently withdrew. The commercial EIA kits have the potential of being able to quantitate specific autoantibody content to ds-DNA, SSB/La, Sm, and Scl-70. However, certain deficiencies in these kits were also detected, the most obvious being lack of uniformly good performance, with kits of certain manufacturers showing exceptional accuracy in 3 out of 4 of their antibody-specific kits and poor accuracy for a 4th kit. It is important for clinicians to appreciate that there is marked inter-manufacturer variation in the performance of EIA kits used as an aid in the diagnosis of systemic rheumatic diseases. Manufacturers need to exercise constant surveillance of kit performance and to provide assurance that such is being done. Improved EIA kits would lend themselves to reliable quantitation of antibody levels in human sera and help to determine whether serial measurement of antibody levels might b

Range of antinuclear antibodies in “healthy” individuals,"['Eng M Tan', 'T. E. W. Feltkamp', 'J S Smolen[...]', 'JA Koziol']","To determine the range of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in ""healthy"" individuals compared with that in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma), Sjögren's syndrome (SS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or soft tissue rheumatism (STR). Fifteen international laboratories experienced in performing tests for ANA by indirect immunofluorescence participated in analyzing coded sera from healthy individuals and from patients in the 5 different disease groups described above. Except for the stipulation that HEp-2 cells should be used as substrate, each laboratory used its own in-house methodology so that the data might be expected to reflect the output of a cross-section of worldwide ANA reference laboratories. The sera were analyzed at 4 dilutions: 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, and 1:320. In healthy individuals, the frequency of ANA did not differ significantly across the 4 age subgroups spanning 20-60 years of age. This putatively normal population was ANA positive in 31.7% of individuals at 1:40 serum dilution, 13.3% at 1:80, 5.0% at 1:160, and 3.3% at 1:320. In comparison with the findings among the disease groups, a low cutoff point at 1:40 serum dilution (high sensitivity, low specificity) could have diagnostic value, since it would classify virtually all patients with SLE, SSc, or SS as ANA positive. Conversely, a high positive cutoff at 1:160 serum dilution (high specificity, low sensitivity) would be useful to confirm the presence of disease in only a portion of cases, but would be likely to exclude 95% of normal individuals. It is recommended that laboratories performing immunofluorescent ANA tests should report results at both the 1:40 and 1:160 dilutions, and should supply information on the percen

“It is their job to make sure that the long-term vision for the show … stays intact”: Using insights from the television format industry to rethink the concept of media events,['Michael Skey'],"The concept of media events continues to generate widespread debate among scholars around the globe. Studies that have challenged the concept’s functionalist foundations have undoubtedly sharpened our thinking. Conversely, approaches that have sought to expand the concept tend to confuse rather than clarify. In this paper, we argue that events that are planned, anticipated, and involve external organizations in their design demand a specific set of analytical tools. Furthermore, we draw a further distinction between one-off events and those that are cyclical in nature, with the latter being theorized using insights from studies of the television format industry. This approach not only focuses much needed attention on the production side of media events but also on the struggles between different interest groups (rights-holders, event hosts, media producers). We illustrate our arguments by drawing upon ethnographic material from the 2014 Eurovision Song Contest.",Article,2020.0, Communications,,0,"

Inequities in Children's Reading Skills: The Role of Home Reading and Preschool Attendance,"['Sharon Goldfeld', 'Margarita Moreno-Betancur', 'Shuaijun Guo[...]', ""Meredith O'Connor""]","Objective : Children from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds have poorer learning outcomes. These inequities are a significant public health issue, tracking forward to adverse health outcomes in adulthood. We examined the potential to reduce socioeconomic gaps in children's reading skills through increasing home reading and preschool attendance amongst disadvantaged children. Methods : We drew on data from the nationally representative birth cohort of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (N=5107) to examine the impact of socioeconomic disadvantage (0-1 year) on children's reading skills (8-9 years). An interventional effects approach was applied to estimate the extent to which improving the levels of home reading (2-5 years) and preschool attendance (4-5 years) of socioeconomically disadvantaged children to be commensurate with their advantaged peers, could potentially reduce socioeconomic gaps in children's reading skills. Results : Socioeconomically disadvantaged children had a higher risk of poor reading outcomes compared to more advantaged peers: absolute risk difference=20% (95% CI: 16.0% to 24.2%). Results suggest that improving disadvantaged children's home reading and preschool attendance to the level of their advantaged peers could eliminate 6.5% and 2.1% of socioeconomic gaps in reading skills, respectively. However, large socioeconomic gaps would remain, with disadvantaged children maintaining an 18.3% (95% CI: 14.0% to 22.7%) higher risk of poor reading outcomes in absolute terms. Conclusions : There are clear socioeconomic disparities in children's reading skills by late childhood. Findings suggest that interventions that improve home reading and preschool atte

Perpetuating ableist constructions of the “real world” through complaints about new communication technologies,"['Elizabeth S. Parks', 'Jessica Sarah Robles']","Complaints about the use of new communication technologies are frequent in public discourse and work within a broader assemblage of discourses that promote selective ideologies. What is it that people are doing when they produce these complaints, and how might acts of complaining promote equity in our daily lives? We analyse complaints taken from 16 hours of video recorded dialogues and argue that the complaint discourse about the relationship of new communication technologies to people’s expected embodied functioning and idealized social participation reconstitutes and perpetuates broader ableist discourses about preferred engagement in the “real world.” By identifying intertextuality between two different topical discourses, we expand understanding about the reification of cross-cutting ableist discourses and promote more inclusive language use.",Article,2021.0, Language and Dialogue,Apr 17,0,"

‘Malaysia belongs to the Malays’ ( Malaysia ni Melayu Punya! ): Categorising ‘us’ and ‘them’ in Malaysia’s mainstream Malay-language newspapers,['Siti Nurnadilla Mohamad Jamil'],"Malaysia’s 13th general election (henceforth, GE13) in 2013 was the final election where the longest-serving elected government in the world, Barisan Nasional (BN), regained power, before it was ousted after over six decades of authoritarian rule in 2018. In a country that practises parliamentary democracy but simultaneously observed close cooperation between the then ruling coalition and the mainstream press, this paper shows the micro-politics of the driving force of the coalition, United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) – specifically, how anxiety regarding the maintenance of their privileged and empowered Malay position dominated the national narrative during the GE13 campaign. Focusing on editorial journalistic genres in four paid-for Malay-language newspapers, I illustrate the typical politics of fear that characterises much of Malaysian right-wing rhetoric – the ways in which racial and religion issues are provoked. The in-depth representational analysis, via the Discourse-historical Approach’s (DHA) nomination and predication strategies, also suggests the normalisation of nationalistic and racist rhetoric, which primarily works with ‘fear’: fear of change, of loss of privilege, of the future, of other races; in principle, almost anything can be constructed as a threat to ‘Us’, an imagined homogenous people inside a well-protected territory through the discursive construction of such in-groups and out-groups.",Article,2020.0, Critical Discourse Studies,Apr 17,0,"

In this article, we examine media usage in Finland in 2007 and 2018. We use two nationally representative surveys (N = 1,388 in 2007 and N = 1,425 in 2018) to make comparisons over time and include a wide set of media usage indicators. Applying multiple correspondence analysis, we assess the impact of the proliferation of online activities on the structure of the space of media usage and examine whether the association between media usage and sociopolitical divisions has become more sharply pronounced. The results suggest stability of the structure of media use rather than dramatic change. We discuss these results by reflecting on the relatively strong persistence of “traditional” models of stratification in digital cultural consumption and media practices.",Article,2021.0, Nordicom Review,Apr 16,1,"

Cosmopolitanism in Hard Times,"['Sylvie Mesure', 'Delphine Pagès-El Karoui', 'Camille Schmoll[...]', 'Vincenzo Cicchelli']","This reference book provides the reader with an exhaustive array of epistemological, theoretical, and empirical explorations related to the field of cosmopolitanism studies. It considers the cosmopolitan perspective rather as a relevant approach to the understanding of some major issues related to globalization than as a subfield of global studies. In this unique contribution to conceptualizing, establishing, experiencing, and challenging cosmopolitanism, each chapter seizes the paradoxical dialectic of opening up and closing up, of enlightenment and counter-enlightenment, of hope and despair at work in the global world, while the volume as a whole insists on the moral, intellectual, structural, and historical resources that still make cosmopolitanism a real possibility — and not just wishful thinking — even in these hard times.

"Facilitativeness, Conflict, Demand for Approval, Self-Esteem, and Satisfaction With Romantic Relationships",['Duncan Cramer'],"This study is an examination of the extent to which satisfaction with a main current romantic relationship is associated with negative conflict, demand for approval, self-esteem, and the 3 facilitative conditions of unconditional regard, empathy, and congruence. One or more of these conditions have been proposed as important determinants of relationship satisfaction by various relationship-enhancement approaches such as behavioral marital therapy and cognitive-behavioral marital therapy. College students (86 women and 58 men) completed S. S. Hendrick's (1988) Relationship Satisfaction Scale, a measure of negative conflict formulated by the author, R. G. Jones's (1969) Demand for Approval Scale (modified for a particular relationship), M. Rosenberg's (1965) Self-Esteem Scale, and a shortened modified version of G. T. Barrett-Lennard's (1964) Relationship Inventory. Relationship satisfaction was most strongly related to the level of regard and empathy, which is consistent with approaches to relationships that emphasize empathy training.",Article,2003.0, The Journal of Psychology Interdisciplinary and Applied,Mar 24,0,"

The Continued Domination of Western Journalists in Global African News Telling: The Imperatives and Implications,['Chikaire Ezeru'],"Who reports Africa in the British press? This longitudinal study is aimed at addressing the issue. It applied content analysis methodology, the use of four British national newspapers and a sample duration that spanned between 1992 and 2017. It uncovered that Western journalists consistently dominated the reportage of Africa without any exception throughout the sample period. Apart from Western journalists, other journalists or sources involved in the media coverage—African local journalists, Afro-Western journalists, joint journalists, and news agencies’ African reports were insignificantly used. Also, this study further revealed that the use of news agencies’ African reports had a continuous decline from 1997 to 2017. Therefore, the domination of the British press coverage of Africa over the years by Western journalists results in the portrayal of Africa from an imbalanced single prism of Westernised perspective, thereby resulting in the poor coverage of Africa and the spread of further ignorance of the continent to the global audience, which hampers both tourism and Western business investments to Africa. This study concludes that who reports Africa in the UK press is embedded in neo-colonialism, white hegemony, and inequality.",Article,2021.0,,Mar 16,0,"

YOT Talk: Examining the communicative influences on children's engagement with youth justice assessment processes,"['Stephen Case', 'Nuria Lorenzo-Dus', 'Ralph Morton']","This article presents an evidence-based analysis of the communicative influences on children’s engagement in the Youth Justice System of England and Wales. The multidisciplinary criminologist–linguist ‘YOT Talk’ project utilized Svalberg’s (2009) dimensions of engagement (cognitive, affective, social; augmented by behavioural) to explore the enablers of, and barriers to, children’s engagement with youth justice assessment processes. A tripartite mixed methodology of observation of assessment interviews, questionnaires with children in the Youth Justice System and youth justice practitioners, and focus groups with practitioners was implemented across three Youth Offending Teams in England and Wales. Analyses synergized methods from conversation analysis and corpus linguistics. Findings inform recommendations for refocusing youth justice assessment and staff training on facilitating children’s communicative engagement (that is, enhancing enablers and removing/minimizing barriers). These findings and recommendations challenge asymmetrical (adult-centric) power dynamics during assessment interviews and challenge perceptions of children’s communicative deficits as irreconcilable barriers to effective assessment.",Article,2021.0, European Journal of Criminology,Mar 9,0,"

The data-driven personalisation of insurance,['Liz Mcfall'],"ABSTRACT Are data-driven techniques ‘personalising’ insurance? The application of new techniques over the last decade has been welcomed in some quarters as a means of disrupting an unpopular industry. In other quarters, disruption is seen as a threat to the solidaristic, risk-spreading principles underlying socialised and, to a lesser extent, privatised insurance models. If risk is to be determined by the behaviour of individuals rather than their membership of pools, this has far-reaching implications for how fairness and non-discrimination are defined and regulated in insurance practice. Yet public debate on the topic has been hampered by confusion over what is meant by ‘personalisation’ and by limited understanding of the role existing insurtech innovations play in assessing risk. To clarify these issues the paper reviews two recent and controversial cases– the use of self-tracking in ‘interactive’ health and life insurance and the use of customer-facing AI by Lemonade Inc. a non-life US based insurtech company.",Conference Paper,,,4d ago,0,"

Corporate Social Responsibility in the Development of China’s Rural Education: A Case Study of Two Counties in Anhui Province,"['Jingbo Hua', 'Natalie Wong']","This research paper took new stakeholder businesses in Tongcheng and Huaining, two cities in Anhui Province, China, as cases for a comparative study to analyse the role of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in supporting education in China’s rural areas. The research primarily used interviews with subjects from the local education bureau, rural schools and related corporations. The study suggests that CSR has promoted rural education in Tongcheng and Huaining through various channels, including foundations, local NGOs, government agencies and direct involvement. However, most CSR involvement is highly vulnerable, owing to the lack of institutionalization and formalization of CSR behaviour. Additionally, the inappropriate administrative practices of governments and unreliable channels of distribution of funds are impediments to CSR. The study demonstrates that CSR is a rapidly developing concept in China, with strong untapped potential to improve rural education if current obstacles can be removed.",Article,0.0, China An International Journal,5d ago,1,"

There is a dearth of evidence from MENA on antiretroviral therapy engagement. In this qualitative study, we sought to identify the ways in which successful treatment is hindered in Iran, which is home to 24% of HIV infections in MENA. Methods From August 2018 to January 2019, we used purposive sampling and conducted 12 individual interviews and 8 focus group discussions with 27 female and 31 male patients, in addition to 5 individual interviews with HIV care providers and 1 focus group discussion with 8 care providers. Social constructivism augmented with realist-informed thematic analysis was used to understand how the socioecological context triggers cognitive and affective mechanisms that disrupt antiretroviral therapy. Results The use of Thematic Network Analysis resulted in the identification of three key cognitive and affective mechanisms that appear to shape treatment experience and are triggered via HIV’s socioecological context and changing economic conditions in Iran: denial in response to societal negative perceptions of HIV; fear in response to societal lack of awareness regarding HIV and misinformation; and despair in response to HIV-related stigma and enacted discrimination, economic insecurity and social support. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study within MENA to identify pathways through which successful treatment is hindered. It appears that lack of societal awareness regarding HIV is specific to low prevalence settings, such as MENA countries, where nega

What roles for viruses in origin of life scenarios?,['Gladys Kostyrka'],"Important roles in origin of life (OL) scenarios have been and still are attributed to viruses. Yet the strict dependence of viruses on cells for their multiplication has been widely acknowledged since the first decades of the 20th century. How could viruses play critical roles in the OL if life relies on cellular organization and if viruses are defined as parasites of cells? In other words, how could viruses play a role in the emergence of cellular life if the existence of cells is a prerequisite for the existence of viruses? This paper investigates this issue and describes past and current OL scenarios conferring viruses with important roles, thereby completing the work of historian of science and physician Scott Podolsky who identified three major roles of viruses in past OL scenarios. Some objections raised by present OL scenarios conferring viruses with an important role are discussed. I argue that disagreements concerning the roles of viruses in OL scenarios stem from the different concepts of life and of virus scientists defend. Investigating the roles of viruses in OL scenarios not only helps identifying different ways to define life in the context of OL theorizing. It also offers the opportunity to better understand how viruses could be conceptualized. The relevance of the replication-first versus metabolism-first dichotomy in OL theorizing is briefly discussed.",Article,6.0, Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences,6d ago,1,"

From obstacle to lynchpin: the evolution of the role of bacteriophage lysogeny in defining and understanding viruses,"['Gladys Kostyrka', 'Neeraja Sankaran']","The phenomenon of bacteriophage lysogeny has played a vital role in understanding the nature of viruses more generally. Discovered in 1920, the phenomenon was first wielded by its discoverers as a challenge to the idea that bacteriophages might be autonomous infectious agents of exogenous origin, namely viruses. But by the 1950s, lysogeny had come to be understood as a key mechanism through which some bacteriophages interacted with their bacterial hosts. In this paper we consider the history of the status of bacteriophage lysogeny from obstacle to lynchpin in conceiving of viruses, paying particular attention to the contributions of Eugène and Élisabeth Wollman, Macfarlane Burnet and André Lwoff in effecting this transition. As Lwoff is often acknowledged to be the author of the ‘modern’ virus concept, this paper also retraces the precise experimental, theoretical and technical pathways that led him and his collaborators from their studies of lysogeny to the construction of the said concept. We discuss Lwoff's virus concept and the widening impact of his ideas, with special consideration of how lysogeny helped revolutionise the understanding virus–host-cell relationships in tumour viruses.",Article,0.0, Notes and Records of The Royal Society,,0,"

"Zooming in on risk- Insurtech, big data and the business of disruption",['Liz Mcfall'],"Abstract: Purpose-built insurance architecture was once commissioned to convey messages of strength, solidity and mythological antiquity and reproduced as corporate graphic identities in print paraphernalia from letterhead to advertisements and souvenir calendars. But is there more at play in insurance architecture than promotional strategy and if architecture has a promotional role, who are the targeted audiences? This paper explores the changing relationship between insurance buildings, insurance brands, and capital and property investment strategies. It considers how the business of property investment propelled the work of big insurers in shaping urban environments through the twentieth century and traces how that began to change as the century closed. The ascendance of the tech industries and the emergence of ‘insurtech’ has been accompanied by a change in the role architecture plays in insurance. Architecture, and interior design, still play a central role in branding but insurtech start-ups, and the insurtech branches of legacy insurers, use it to convey lightness, agility, creativity and informality. These changes line up with a signature big tech aesthetic – more valley, less city – that is designed to evoke innovation and disruption. This is a narrative that is targeted at investors as much as consumers.",Preprint,,,7d ago,0,"

Accelerating Sustainable Development Goals for South African adolescents from high HIV prevalence areas a longitudinal path analysis,"['Franziska Meinck', 'Frederick Orkin', 'Lucie Cluver']","Background Adolescents experience a multitude of vulnerabilities which need to be addressed in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In sub-Saharan Africa, adolescents experience high burden of HIV, violence exposure, poverty, and poor mental and physical health. This study aimed to identify interventions and circumstances associated with three or more targets (“accelerators”) within multiple SDGs relating to HIV-affected adolescents and examine cumulative effects on outcomes. Methods Prospective longitudinal data from 3401 adolescents from randomly selected census enumeration areas in two provinces with > 30% HIV prevalence carried out in 2010/11 and 2011/12 were used to examine six hypothesized accelerators (positive parenting, parental monitoring, free schooling, teacher support, food sufficiency and HIV-negative/asymptomatic caregiver) targeting twelve outcomes across four SDGs, using a multivariate (multiple outcome) path model with correlated outcomes controlling for outcome at baseline and socio-demographics. The study corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing and tested measurement invariance across sex. Percentage predicted probabilities of occurrence of the outcome in the presence of the significant accelerators were also calculated. Results Sample mean age was 13.7 years at baseline, 56.6% were female. Positive parenting, parental monitoring, food sufficiency and AIDS-free caregiver were variously associated with reductions on ten outcomes. The model was gender invariant. AIDS-free caregiver was associated with the largest reductions. Combinations of accelerators resulted in a percentage reduction of risk of up to 40%. Conclusion Positive parenting, parental mo

Exploring the willingness to adopt rapid diagnostic tests to improve antimicrobial medicine use amongst Tanzanian livestock farmers,"['Vera Florida Mugittu', 'Henry Buller', 'Ann Bruce']","This article deals with the challenge of addressing antimicrobial resistance in resource-poor countries. It explores the possibilities of using rapid diagnostic tests to improve animal health management and treatment, particularly in situations where laboratory veterinary infrastructure is limited. Using data from a survey undertaken in 2018, three composite variables, i.e. perceived usefulness, compatibility with existing practices and ease of use, derived from the Model of Technological Acceptance and Diffusion Innovation Theory are used to analyse the perceived characteristics and values of rapid diagnostic test devices for farmers. Results suggest smallholder farmers’ willingness to adopt and use the tests provided they are affordable, easy to use and suitable to their local conditions – a common referential being mobile phones. While such tests have the potential to improve how antibiotics are used in smallholder farms, they are more likely to instigate more general improvements in how treatment decisions are made without necessarily reducing unnecessary antimicrobial use. The adoption may also imply a diminishing need for traditional veterinary services, thus making farmers more self-sufficient in animal health care. Farmers also seem to be more concerned by false negatives leading to sick animals missing vital treatment than by false positives where drugs will be administered to healthy animals. Overall promoting rapid diagnostic test technologies inevitably calls for new controls and regulations.",Article,1.0, International Journal of Technology Management and Sustainable Development,Nov 10,0,"

IR theory and Area Studies: a plea for displaced knowledge about international politics,"['Katarzyna Kaczmarska', 'Stefanie Ortmann']","This article critically engages with the hierarchical binary between theory and area research in the study of international politics. We pose questions about the processes which construct and reaffirm the theory/area distinction in IR and show that the binary creates structural pressures and reinscribes hierarchies for individual scholars. We notice that IR’s Euro/West-centrism is directly linked to and perpetuated by the divide that privileges IR theorising over empirical research both on and from places outside of the West. We show how this divide has been institutionalised with the effect of producing separate but intertwined academic fields of ‘IR’ and ‘Area Studies’. The hitherto voiced calls to overcome the divide have largely focused on the question of how to give more weight to knowledge produced about the ‘non-West’ in IR. This, we argue, overlooks the broader significance of the theory/area divide, which lies in the socio-instructional structures maintaining it and the concrete effects they have on researchers from the ‘peripheries’. This article, therefore, aims to examine the construction of Area Studies’ peripherality and to rethink possible solutions. To better illustrate the intersection of epistemic politics and political economy of knowledge production, we highlight the experience of researchers from the Global East.",Article,1.0, Journal of International Relations and Development,Nov 5,0,"

Populism as an act of storytelling: analyzing the climate change narratives of Donald Trump and Greta Thunberg as populist truth-tellers,"['Johan Nordensvard', 'Markus Ketola']","We propose that populism is a storytelling performance that involves a charismatic ‘truth-teller’ and a populist narrative frame. Populist narratives are sensemaking devices that guide people in areas of contestation, uncertainty and complexity where decisions cannot solely rely on rational and formal processes. Populist ‘truth-tellers’ apply a particular narrative frame that pits ‘people’ against the ‘elite’ when interpreting complex problems such as climate change. The aim of this article is one of theory generating, using the cases of Donald Trump and Greta Thunberg to illustrate the idea of populism as story-telling. While their climate change stories are very different, both share an approach that relies on the ‘truth-telling’ character of their hero, applying the same populist narrative frame. These findings add to our understanding of the role emotions and conflicts play in the struggles to make sense of climate change based on particular interests or political agendas.",Article,1.0, Environmental Politics,Nov 3,0,"

Learner pregnancy in South Africa’s Eastern Cape: The Factors affecting adolescent girls' school withdrawal during pregnancy,"['Janina Jochim', 'Lucie D.

However, few studies have investigated which factors affect adolescents’ school discontinuation during pregnancy. This study interviewed 1,046 adolescent mothers from the Eastern Cape province in South Africa. The results showed that a quarter of school-going adolescent girls withdrew from school during the pregnancy - many as early as the first trimester. School withdrawal was associated with higher poverty, higher grade repetition, an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy, and greater lack of information about the pregnancy. Given the high enrolment rates at the onset of the pregnancy, school-based services may provide an opportunity to identify which girls require substantial support to remain in education throughout pregnancy, using a history of poor school performance as an indicator for dropout.",Article,1.0, International Journal of Educational Development,,1,"

Evolutionarily divergent mTOR remodels the translatome to drive rapid wound closure and regeneration,"['Olena Zhulyn', 'Hannah Dorothy Rosenblatt', 'Leila Shokat[...]', 'Maria Barna']","An outstanding mystery in biology is why some species, such as the axolotl, can scarlessly heal and regenerate tissues while most mammals cannot. Here, we demonstrate that rapid activation of protein synthesis is a unique, and previously uncharacterized, feature of the injury response critical for limb regeneration in the axolotl (A. mexicanum). By applying polysome sequencing, we identify hundreds of transcripts, including antioxidants and ribosome components, which do not change in their overall mRNA abundance but are selectively activated at the level of translation from pre-existing mRNAs in response to injury. In contrast, we show that protein synthesis is not activated in response to digit amputation in the non-regenerative mouse. We further identify the mTORC1 pathway as a key upstream signal that mediates this regenerative translation response in the axolotl. Inhibition of this pathway is sufficient to suppress translation and axolotl regeneration. Surprisingly, although mTOR is highly evolutionarily conserved, we discover unappreciated expansions in mTOR protein sequence among urodele amphibians. By engineering an axolotl mTOR in human cells, we demonstrate that this change creates a hypersensitive kinase that may allow axolotls to maintain this pathway in a highly labile state primed for rapid activation. This may underlie metabolic differences and nutrient sensing between regenerative and non-regenerative species that are key to regeneration. Together, these findings highlight the unanticipated impact of the translatome on orchestrating the early steps of wound healing in highly regenerative species and provide a missing link in our understanding of vertebrate reg

"On the design of linked datasets mapping networks of collaboration in the genomic sequencing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, and Sus scrofa","['Mark Wong', 'Rhodri Leng']","This paper describes a unique two-step methodology used to construct six linked bibliometric datasets covering the sequencing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Homo sapiens , and S us scrofa genomes. First, we retrieved all sequence submission data from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), including accession numbers associated with each species. Second, we used these accession numbers to construct queries to retrieve peer-reviewed scientific publications that first linked to these sequence lengths in the scientific literature. For each species, this resulted in two associated datasets: 1) A .csv file documenting the PMID of each article describing new sequences, all paper authors, all institutional affiliations of each author, countries of institution, year of first submission to the ENA, and the year of article publication, and 2) A .csv file documenting all institutions submitting to the ENA, number of nucleotides sequenced, number of submissions per institution in a given year, and years of submission to the database. In several upcoming publications, we utilise these datasets to understand how institutional collaboration shaped sequencing efforts, and to systematically identify important institutions and changes in network structures over time. This paper, therefore, should aid researchers who would like to use these data for future analyses by making the methodology that underpins it transparent. Further, by detailing our methodology, researchers may be able to utilise our approach to construct similar datasets in the future.",Article,0.0, F 1000  Research,Oct 28,1,"

Diversity in citations to a single study: A citation context network analysis of how evidence from a prospective cohort study was cited,['Rhodri Leng'],"Between its origin in the 1950s and its endorsement by a consensus conference in 1984, the diet–heart hypothesis was the object of intense controversy. Paul et al. (1963) is a highly-cited prospective cohort study that reported findings inconvenient for this hypothesis, reporting no association between diet and heart disease; however, many other findings were also reported. By citation context and network analysis of 343 citing papers, I show how Paul et al. was cited in the twenty years after its publication. Generally, different findings were cited by different communities focussing on different risk-factors; communities established by either research foci title terms or via cluster membership as established via modularity maximisation. The most frequently cited findings were the significant associations between heart disease; and serum cholesterol (n=85), blood pressure (n=57), and coffee consumption (n=54). The lack of association between diet and heart disease was cited in just 41 papers. Yet, no single empirical finding was referred to in more than 25% of the citing papers. This raises questions about the value of inferring impact from citation counts alone, and raises problems for studies using such counts to measure citation bias.

Mindfulness practices are beginning to be integrated into social work curricula globally to enhance student self-care along with key social work practice skills and values. This mixed methods study examined the effects of a bespoke six-week online mindfulness-based social work and self-care (MBSWSC) programme on the stress, burnout, well-being, anxiety and depression levels of thirty social work students from two universities in the UK. This study also examined the effects of MBSWSC on a number of mindfulness-based mediators of change in these outcomes. Participant perceptions of the benefits of the MBSWSC programme on their well-being and social work practice are further explored via a thematic analysis of an open-ended questionnaire. Statistically significant changes in all variables were found post-programme except for depression and loss of empathy/depersonalisation, a facet of burnout.

"""You Do It Through the Grapevine"": A Bourdieusian Analysis of Under-Age Access to Tobacco Among Adolescents From Seven European Cities","['Rebecca Hewer', 'Sarah Hill', 'Amanda Amos']","Despite efforts to reduce adolescent smoking via minimum age-of-sale legislation, many young people continue to access tobacco through a mix of social and commercial sources. Little is known about the roles of habitus, capital, and social topographies in shaping under-age access to tobacco. This article draws on Bourdieu's theory of practice and data generated from 56 focus groups with 14- to 19-year-olds across seven European cities to answer the question ""via what sources and by what means do adolescents obtain tobacco?"" We find that adolescents use a range of personal capitals (social, cultural, and economic) to access tobacco, with the specific constitution and deployment of these capitals varying according to the regularities of different fields. Since adolescents access tobacco via culturally embedded practices, attempts to curtail this access are more likely to be effective if they are multi-pronged, culturally informed, and attuned to the lived experiences of adolescent smokers.",Article,1.0, Qualitative Health Research,Oct 26,0,"

The book offers an innovative perspective on how individual behavior is socially patterned. It draws in part on the massive recent explosion of self-help manuals, television shows, and internet sites designed to produce and sanction particular forms of behavior. It also taps into the enduring fascination with situations in which extreme and violent conduct is widespread.

Systems-level analysis of how flaviviruses hijack cellular processes through virus-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs) provides information about their replication and pathogenic mechanisms. We used affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to compare flavivirus-host interactions for two viruses (DENV and ZIKV) in two hosts (human and mosquito). Conserved virus-host PPIs revealed that the flavivirus NS5 protein suppresses interferon stimulated genes by inhibiting recruitment of the transcription complex PAF1C and that chemical modulation of SEC61 inhibits DENV and ZIKV replication in human and mosquito cells. Finally, we identified a ZIKV-specific interaction between NS4A and ANKLE2, a gene linked to hereditary microcephaly, and showed that ZIKV NS4A causes microcephaly in Drosophila in an ANKLE2-dependent manner. Thus, comparative flavivirus-host PPI mapping provides biological insights and, when coupled with in vivo models, can be used to unravel pathogenic mechanisms.

A p53-dependent translational program directs tissue-selective phenotypes in a model of ribosomopathies,"['Gerald Tiu', 'Craig H Kerr', 'Craig M.

What accounts for such tissue-selective manifestations as a result of mutations in the ribosome, a ubiquitous cellular machine, has remained a mystery. Combining mouse genetics and in vivo ribosome profiling, we observe limb-patterning phenotypes in ribosomal protein (RP) haploinsufficient embryos, and we uncover selective translational changes of transcripts that controlling limb development. Surprisingly, both loss of p53, which is activated by RP haploinsufficiency, and augmented protein synthesis rescue these phenotypes. These findings are explained by the finding that p53 functions as a master regulator of protein synthesis, at least in part, through transcriptional activation of 4E-BP1. 4E-BP1, a key translational regulator, in turn, facilitates selective changes in the translatome downstream of p53, and this thereby explains how RP haploinsufficiency may elicit specificity to gene expression.

Drawing on examples of both success and failure, contributors analyze specific cases to understand the kinds of institutions that emerge in response to demands for territorial pluralism, as well as their political effects.

It examines the medium’s affordances as revealed through its use and the symbolic interactions that take place in doing so. Once established, I discuss the implications of such a paradigm shift through the lens of Sartre’s phenomenological ontology and flush out how users can safeguard against falling victim to the mirage of Facebook’s essentializing invitation.",Chapter,,,Oct 13,0,"

An Exploratory Survey of Mental Health Social Work in Europe,"['Kevin Stone', 'Pearse Mccusker', 'Gavin Davidson', 'Sarah Vicary']","This article reports on an exploratory study comparing mental health social work (MHSW) in Europe. There has been very limited previous research comparing approaches to MHSW in Europe and so the aim of the study was to develop a better understanding of the similarities and differences between and, where relevant, within countries (referred to as jurisdictions). An online survey was distributed mainly through existing European networks and social media to seek information on the role, nature, extent and context of MHSW in a range of European jurisdictions. Conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, there were 158 responses from 10 jurisdictions. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. From this analysis, four main themes were identified, relating to: role; law, policy and education; the distinctive contribution made by MHSW; and the key challenges for MHSW. The study demonstrates that MHSW, although it is described and provided in different ways and is confined by a range of factors, plays an important role in mental health services across jurisdictions. There are also interesting differences between contexts, especially in the balance of therapeutic, legal and specialist/generic approaches, some of which reflect the World Health Organisation’s vision and objectives for mental health. Lastly, the study illustrates a need and provides a valuable basis for further comparative and collaborative work to define MHSW and enhance the contributions it makes.",Article,1.0, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,Oct 10,0,"

Using data-driven approaches to improve delivery of animal health care interventions for public health,"['Stella Mazeri', 'Jordana L. Burdon Bailey', 'Dagmar Mayer[...]', 'Richard J Mellanby']","Rabies kills ∼60,000 people per year. Annual vaccination of at least 70% of dogs has been shown to eliminate rabies in both human and canine populations. However, delivery of large-scale mass dog vaccination campaigns remains a challenge in many rabies-endemic countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, where the vast majority of dogs are owned, mass vaccination campaigns have typically depended on a combination of static point (SP) and door-to-door (D2D) approaches since SP-only campaigns often fail to achieve 70% vaccination coverage. However, D2D approaches are expensive, labor-intensive, and logistically challenging, raising the need to develop approaches that increase attendance at SPs. Here, we report a real-time, data-driven approach to improve efficiency of an urban dog vaccination campaign. Historically, we vaccinated ∼35,000 dogs in Blantyre city, Malawi, every year over a 20-d period each year using combined fixed SP (FSP) and D2D approaches. To enhance cost effectiveness, we used our historical vaccination dataset to define the barriers to FSP attendance. Guided by these insights, we redesigned our vaccination campaign by increasing the number of FSPs and eliminating the expensive and labor-intensive D2D component. Combined with roaming SPs, whose locations were defined through the real-time analysis of vaccination coverage data, this approach resulted in the vaccination of near-identical numbers of dogs in only 11 d. This approach has the potential to act as a template for successful and sustainable future urban SP-only dog vaccination campaigns.",Article,1.0, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,Oct 8,1,"

Factors associated with mobile phone ownership and potential use for rabies vaccination campaigns in southern Malawi,"['Orla Marron', 'Gareth Thomas', 'Jordana L. Burdon Bailey[...]', 'Stella Mazeri']","Background: Rabies is a fatal but preventable viral disease, which causes an estimated 59 000 human deaths globally every year. The vast majority of human rabies cases are attributable to bites from infected domestic dogs and consequently control of rabies in the dog population through mass vaccination campaigns is considered the most effective method of eliminating the disease. Achieving the WHO target of 70% vaccination coverage has proven challenging in low-resource settings such as Sub Saharan Africa, and lack of public awareness about rabies vaccination campaigns is a major barrier to their success. In this study we surveyed communities in three districts in Southern Malawi to assess the extent of and socio-economic factors associated with mobile phone ownership and explore the attitudes of communities towards the use of short message service (SMS) to inform them of upcoming rabies vaccination clinics. Methods: This study was carried out between 1 October-3 December 2018 during the post-vaccination assessment of the annual dog rabies campaign in Blantyre, Zomba and Chiradzulu districts, Malawi. 1882 questionnaires were administered to households in 90 vaccination zones. The surveys gathered data on mobile phone ownership and use, and barriers to mobile phone access. A multivariable regression model was used to understand factors related to mobile phone ownership. Results: Most survey respondents owned or had use of a mobile phone, however there was evidence of an inequality of access, with higher education level, living in Blantyre district and being male positively associated with mobile phone ownership. The principal barrier to mobile phone ownership was the cost of the phone its

When do social democratic parties unite over tough immigration policy?,"['Philip Rathgeb', 'Fabio Wolkenstein']","Attempting to reconcile the diverse immigration policy demands of the ‘old’ working class and the ‘new’ middle class, social democratic parties struggle to take a clear position on immigration policy. Adopting more restrictive policies is a possible way forward, but this is likely to lead to electorally costly intra-party conflict. This article illuminates the conditions under which social democratic parties can unite behind more restrictive immigration policies and promote them consistently. Employing a most-similar systems design, it presents a comparative case study of the Austrian and Danish social democrats, from the 2015 ‘refugee crisis’ to 2020. The article argues that low levels of territorial decentralisation enabled the Danish social democrats to promote a restrictive stance on immigration top-down, while the Austrian social democrats’ federal party structure exacerbated internal disagreements between urban and rural leaders. These findings highlight the importance of internal party characteristics in explaining how parties respond to strategic trade-offs.

The Importance of Context and the Effect of Information and Deliberation on Opinion Change Regarding Environmental Issues in Citizens’ Juries,"['Andrew Thompson', 'Oliver Escobar', 'Jennifer J. Roberts[...]', 'Niccole M. Pamphilis']","Citizens’ juries have become a popular method for engaging citizens in deliberation about complex public policy issues, such as climate action and sustainable development. Empirical evidence routinely indicates that jurors change their minds throughout the process. What is less clear is when and why this occurs and whether the causes are consistent across juries that consider the same topic but are situated within different contexts. We present evidence of opinion change in citizens’ juries through a natural experiment, contrasting three local contexts of onshore windfarm development in Scotland; viz. existing, planned, and absent. Jurors’ individual opinions of climate change, wind energy, and windfarms were measured through questionnaires at four time points: the start, following information-giving, reflection, and deliberation. Statistical examination of jurors’ responses, through paired sample t-tests, Wilcoxon sign-tests, and Generalised Least Squares regression, reveals to what extent substantive changes were associated with different phases and locational contexts. In all three juries, opinion change occurs throughout the process, on different topics, and to different degrees. While the information phase consistently influences jurors’ opinions the most, jury composition affects the magnitude and direction of opinion change, with outcomes contingent on contexts. Our findings are important for informing how mini-publics are designed and used to inform environmental policy-making at different scales.",Article,1.0, Sustainability,Sep 22,1,"

Mediation pathways for reduced substance use among parents in South Africa: a randomized controlled trial,"['Adeem Ahmad Massarwi', 'Lucie Cluver', 'Franziska Meinck[...]', 'Ohad Green']","Background Substance use is a major public health concern worldwide. Alcohol and drug use have increased during recent decades in many low- and middle-income countries, with South Africa, where this study was conducted, having among the highest rates in the world. Despite existing evidence on the effectiveness of family-based interventions in reducing substance use among parents and caregivers in low- and middle-income countries, little is known about the mechanism of change that contributes to the reduction. This study investigated mediators of change in a parenting programme (Parenting for Lifelong Health [PLH]) on reducing substance use among parents and caregivers of adolescents through three potential mediators: parental depression, parenting stress and family poverty. Methods The current study used a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial design. The total sample comprised 552 parent and caregiver of adolescents M = 49.37(SD = 14.69) who were recruited from 40 communities in South Africa’s Eastern Cape. Participants completed a structured confidential self-report questionnaire at baseline and a follow-up test 5 to 9 months after the intervention. Structural equation modeling was conducted to investigate direct and indirect effects. Results Analyses indicated that the effect of the PLH intervention on reducing parental substance use was mediated in one indirect pathway: improvement in parental mental health (reduction in parental depression levels). No mediation pathways from the PLH intervention on parental substance use could be associated with parenting stress or family poverty.

"Dilemmas of an Academic Feminist as Manager in the Neoliberal Academy: Negotiating Institutional Authority, Oppositional Knowledge and Change",['Fiona Mackay'],"While still rare, women are achieving important leadership roles as managers inside universities. This article explores the practical and theoretical dilemmas posed for academic feminists who enter such positions in the age of the rise of the ‘neoliberal academy’. These are familiar dilemmas for feminist bureaucrats – femocrats – working inside political, governmental, judicial and economic institutions but have been less explored with respect to the academy. What can academic feminists do when they take on middle or senior management roles? How do they experience being simultaneously the embodiment of institutional authority (to manage, regulate, quantify, monetise) as managers, as well as a source of oppositional knowledge as feminists? To what extent are there opportunities to work with the grain of an institution to challenge the gendered status quo from within? Or are academic feminists who manage inevitably co-opted and compromised? The article takes an autoethnographic approach to reflect upon the author’s experience as a ‘tempered radical’ in third tier management (as an executive dean and head of school) in a public research-intensive UK university, and to offer lessons about the radical potential of insider strategies of change.",Article,0.0, Political Studies Review,Sep 13,0,"

Voices from the Past: Economic and Political Vulnerabilities in the Making of Next Generation EU Forthcoming in Comparative European Politics (Accepted version),"['Klaus Armingeon', 'Caroline de la Porte', 'Elke Heins', 'Stefano Sacchi']","In this article, we show that Next Generation EU (NGEU) is mainly a response to the economic and political imbalances left over from the Eurozone crisis. It is a pre-emptive intervention, especially targeted at structurally weak economies with rising Euroscepticism, to avoid costly ex-post bailouts as in the Great Recession. We demonstrate, using quantitative analysis, that pre-existing vulnerabilities, rather than the impact of the pandemic, drove the allocation of NGEU resources: per capita grants largely correspond to past economic vulnerabilities, as well as to political ones. Countries most vulnerable to another adjustment by austerity after the Covid-19 economic crisis receive most resources. Also, countries with strong anti-EU sentiments are entitled to larger NGEU grants per capita. In contrast, grants are not correlated with the severity of the health crisis. Then we show the domestic relevance of economic and political vulnerabilities through qualitative case studies of national political debates and domestic positions on NGEU in Italy, Germany and the Netherlands. Despite its innovative traits, NGEU is a politically constrained solution to address the mess from the previous decade, and as such, it is a Janus solution: promising a fresh start, but haunted by the past.",Preprint,,,Aug 31,0,"

"Agency, Activism, and Agendas",['Patricia Jeffery'],"Feminist activism in South Asia has contributed both to raising people’s awareness of gender injustices and to directly combating them. In part, politicized religion may be a response to the challenges posed by feminist activism and by secular changes in the wider economy (Chhachhi, 1991). More certainly politicized religion has often been implicated in developments that are potentially deeply inimical to women’s interests—and yet many women’s energies have been successfully engaged in their support. Feminists can surely derive little satisfaction, for instance, from the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) ability to mobilize women in defense of Rām’s birthplace, often in far greater numbers than feminist organizations have managed to mobilize women to protest dowry murder.",Chapter,,,Aug 25,0,"

The impact of childhood psychological maltreatment on mental health outcomes in adulthood: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis,"['Zhuoni Xiao', 'Mina Murat Baldwin', 'Franziska Meinck[...]', 'Aja Louise Murray']","Background Research suggests that childhood psychological maltreatment (i.e., emotional abuse and emotional neglect) is associated with mental health problems that persist into adulthood, for example anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicidal ideation, and aggression; however, a systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing literature would help clarify the magnitude and moderators of these associations, and the extent to which they may be affected by publication bias, as well as the methodological strengths and weakness of studies in this area. Method The reporting of this protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) Statement. Searches will be carried out via several databases, including Web of Science, Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, Applied Social Science Index and Abstract, ERIC and EMBASE.

We aimed to investigate long-term outcomes of the adalimumab (ADA) biosimilar SB5 in IBD patients following a switch from the ADA originator (SB5-switch cohort) or after start of SB5 (SB5-start cohort). Methods: We performed an observational cohort study in a tertiary IBD referral centre. All IBD patients treated with Humira® underwent an elective switch to SB5. We identified all these patients in a biologic prescription database that prospectively registered all ADA start and stop dates including brand names. Data on IBD phenotype, CRP, drug persistence, ADA drug and antibody levels, and faecal calprotectin were collected. Results: 481 patients were treated with SB5, 256 in the SB5-switch cohort (median follow-up: 13.7 months [8.6-15.2]) and 225 in the SB5-start cohort (median follow-up: 8.3 months [4.2-12.8]). 70.8% of the SB5-switch cohort remained on SB5 beyond one year; 90/256 discontinued SB5, mainly due to adverse events (46/90) or secondary loss of response (37/90). In the SB5-start cohort, 81/225 discontinued SB5 resulting in SB5-drug persistence of 60.3% beyond one year. No differences in clinical remission (p=0.53), CRP (p=0.80), faecal calprotectin (p=0.40) and ADA trough levels (p=0.55) were found between baseline, week 26 and week 52 following switch.

Patterns of adverse childhood experiences and associations with prenatal substance use and poor infant outcomes in a multi-country cohort of mothers: A Latent Class Analysis,"['Chad Lance Hemady', 'Lydia Speyer', 'Aja Louise Murray[...]', 'Manuel P Eisner']","Aims This paper explores the number and characterization of latent classes of adverse childhood experiences across the Evidence for Better Lives Study cohort and investigates how the various typologies link to prenatal substance use (i.e., smoking, alcohol, and illicit drugs) and poor infant outcomes (i.e., infant prematurity and low birth weight). Participants and setting A total of 1,189 mother-infant dyads residing in eight diverse low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) were recruited. Methods Latent class analysis using the Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars (BCH) 3-step method with auxiliary multilevel logistic regressions with distal outcomes were performed. Results The LCA identified three high-risk classes and one low-risk class, namely: (1) highly maltreated (7%, n = 89), (2) emotionally and physically abused with intra-familial violence exposure (13%, n = 152), (3), emotionally abused (40%, n = 474), and (4) low household dysfunction and abuse (40%, n = 474). Overall, across all latent classes, there were low probabilities of prenatal substance use and poor infant outcomes. However, pairwise comparisons between classes indicate that class 1 and 3 had higher probabilities of prenatal illicit drug use compared to class 4. Additionally, class 2 had higher probability of low birth weight compared to the three remaining classes. Conclusion The results further our understanding of the dynamic and multifaceted nature of ACEs. More research grounded on LMICs is warranted with more attention to various parameters of risk exposure (i.e., severity, duration, chronicity).",Preprint,,,Aug 1,1,"

The emerging norms of e-cigarette use among adolescents: A meta-ethnography of qualitative evidence,"['Hannah Smith', 'Mark Lucherini', 'Amanda Amos', 'Sarah Hill']","While qualitative research has indicated that adolescents’ motivation for e-cigarette use is different than adults’, this body of literature has not yet been brought together and synthesised. We reviewed qualitative evidence on perceptions and uses of e-cigarettes in order to explore the emerging norms of vaping among adolescents. We searched five databases for qualitative research in October 2019 with no restrictions on date of publication or data collection. We identified fifteen papers from thirteen studies. Using a meta-ethnographic approach, we identified a spectrum of descriptive and injunctive norms of vaping across the themes of addiction; perceptions of comparative harm; parental perceptions and peer perceptions. We found addiction and perceptions of comparative harm to reflect descriptive norms, while we found clearer evidence explaining the use and non-use of e-cigarettes through parental and peer approval of vaping. However, these norms were fluid, diverse and sometimes contradictory. This review provides a resource for researchers, policymakers and practitioners to better understand the ways that emerging norms could be influenced through policy and practice.",Literature Review,1.0, The International journal on drug policy,Aug 1,0,"

A New Era of European Integration? Governance of Labour Market and Social Policy Since the Sovereign Debt Crisis,"['Caroline de la Porte', 'Elke Heins']","In this chapter we develop a typology of European Union (EU) integration to capture how, to what extent and according to which policy aims EU involvement in Member States has altered with respect to labour market and social policy and what it signifies in terms of institutional change. On this basis, first we show that new instruments—the Six-Pack, Fiscal Compact and Two-Pack—have been layered onto the existing institutional framework governing the European Monetary Union (EMU). Furthermore, we show that the instruments strengthening budgetary discipline to improve the functioning of the EMU have become more explicit in terms of policy objectives, particularly specifying new benchmarks to obtain fiscal discipline. They are also stricter in terms of surveillance and enforcement. Secondly, we show that there are initiatives to address and improve the social dimension of the EU—Europe 2020, the Social Investment Package and the Youth Guarantee—and that these have also emerged through a process of institutional layering. However, the aims around Europe 2020 and Social Investment continue to be based on the voluntary Open Method of Coordination, with comparatively weak surveillance and enforcement. In the current context, and to attain economic growth together with social cohesion and welfare, it is of utmost importance that EMU criteria should be altered to take account of social investments.",Chapter,,,Jul 29,1,"

When the results were aggregated, the nuances between the two regions were hidden. When the results were disaggregated between the regions, assumed patterns – such as the majority of migrants being external labor migrants – were still identified; however, distinct differences between them were also found. There was regional variation in the status of migrants prior to migrating, motivations for migration, remittance transfer options, proportion of migrants engaged in internal and external migration, and gender dynamics. Equally, for natural resource management use and risk, results also varied regionally.

Public health and far-right: The Brazilian case of coronavirus infodemic,"['Ricardo Ribeiro Ferreira', 'Juliana Alcantara']","The rumours alarm sounded in Brazil in early January 2020, when disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak started to emerge. Besides a public health crisis, Brazil has been facing a political crisis. In less than two months, two health ministers resigned under a president who publicly discredits science. Numbers of contaminations and deaths show an exponential growth day by day, having already passed the glooming mark of 9 million cases and 230 thousand deaths. As Tedros Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), alerted for an “infodemic”, predicting the viral spread of misleading content about coronavirus in a pandemic scenario, we argue that covid-19 disinformation becomes a useful political tool, particularly for the far-right. Information plays a crucial role in decision-making processes and ways of living, alongside political positioning. Preliminary research in this area suggests a relation between misleading content and news cases of the disease (Singha et al., 2020; Moreno et al., 2020). This paper aims to map the flow of disinformation related to the pandemic in Brazil and discuss its main themes, examining possible connections with political issues and actors in the country. We employed a quantitative approach to publications that circulated on social media in 2020. First, we constructed a sample of 255 high engagement disinformation pieces using document analysis (Bowen, 2009).

Creating an innovation ecosystem for rapid diagnostic tests for livestock to support sustainable antibiotic use,"['Ann Bruce', 'Katherine Adam', 'Henry Buller[...]', 'Joyce Tait']","Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of today’s greatest public health threats and reducing antimicrobial use in livestock is essential to prevent its spread, requiring rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to ensure that the drug prescribed matches the sensitivity of the disease organism. However, despite decades of research on RDTs and a relatively permissive regulatory environment in the UK, few devices are in commercial use. Challenges discussed by RDT developers included identifying commercially-viable targets, and management of the innovation ecosystem, e.g. to create clear pathways to market supporting positive interactions between farmers, vets, and other actors along the value chain. Future support for RDT development could be provided through incorporation in: assured food systems; business service packages provided by centralised laboratories; or animal health monitoring packages related to the spread of AMR. Breeding stock sales could require an accompanying health package including RDTs, vaccines and/or antibiotics, linking to precision agriculture approaches. Unlike the example of RDT development for COVID-19, it seems that the urgency of the issue and the clarity of links between animal and human health outcomes are not yet sufficient to support a fast-tracking programme for the development of RDTs to combat AMR.",Article,1.0, Technology Analysis and Strategic Management,Jul 12,1,"

Multiple meanings in South Indian temple worship,['Anthony Good'],"The survival of the cosmos is said to depend upon proper performance of the complex daily liturgy in large Hindu temples. This paper describes such daily worship in the Murukan temple at Kalugumalai, South India. After considering the significance of the principal stages—unction, decoration, food‐offering, and lamp‐showing—in the pūja rite which forms the basis of worship in Saivite temples, it seeks to understand this liturgy with reference to Hindu metaphysics, iconography and mythology, and notions of divine sovereignty. It is argued that such multi‐thematic analyses, which combine ethnographic and indological approaches, are essential for understanding contemporary Hindu practice.",Article,,,Jul 11,0,"

Disinformation in anti-Eu Facebook Groups Digital Methods Initiative Winter School 2020,"['Aichatou Sow', 'Berit Renser', 'Camille Godineau[...]', 'Ines Narciso']","Since the 2016 United States presidential election (Faris et al., 2017), concerns have raised globally about the risk of instrumentalization of social media by political actors interested in interfering in the democratic process (Del-Fresno-García et. al, 2018). In Europe those concerns grew after reporting of disinformation campaigns in the Brexit (Cadwalladr, 2017), Cataluña (Marino et. al, 2019) and French elections (Chesney & Citron, 2019). Since then, interference of “fake news” in the political discourse has been thoroughly analysed (Fletcher et al., 2018; Jack, 2017; Bennett & Livingstone, 2018). Research that covers disinformation with an anti-European discourse focuses mostly on possible Russian interference, Twitter and big data sets (Golovchenko, et. al., 2018; Gorrell et. al., 2019, Pierri et. al., 2019) and there is not a lot of understanding about how anti-EU online communities interact, share and produce disinformation. More importantly, the current project tried to demonstrate the relevance of adapting methodologies to study not only disinformation but digital phenomena in general in an closed API environment (Bruns, 2019; Perriam et. al., 2019). The more hands-on approach of manually fact-checking, categorizing and analysing a smaller number of posts in an ever more closed platform like Facebook contradicts general research focusing on AI, big data, Twitter-based data collection and analysis. However, as translated in this current report and previous findings using the same methodology (Cardoso et. al. 2019), it contributes with valid issues for the knowledge base. https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/WinterSchool2020DisinformationEU#A_1",Research,,,Jul 6,1,"

The COVID-19 pandemic: Failing forward in public health,"['The Law Centre For Health And Life - University of Amsterdam', 'Scott L Greer', 'Anniek De Ruijter', 'Eleanor Brooks']","Although most governments were heavily scrutinized and looked bad early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU was most noticeable for its absence. This might seem strange, for an institution whose public health role has been forged through crisis—from the thalidomide tragedy and the scandal of HIV-infected blood supplies, to “mad cow disease” and the underwhelming H1N1 influenza pandemic. A closer review of the EU’s health governance, however, reveals it to have performed exactly as expected and intended. An initial phase of disorganization and national egotism, unavoidable given that member states have historically restricted the EU’s health capacities, has been followed by a substantial new health policy agenda and a reinforcement of the EU’s market- and fiscal-based health influence. This is leading, we posit, to further integration.",Chapter,,,,0,"

How to study the populist radical right and the welfare state?,"['Philip Rathgeb', 'Marius R. Busemeyer']","This review article and special issue introduction argues that studying the relationship between the populist radical right and the welfare state requires bridging literatures that have so far advanced with little mutual engagement: party politics and voting behaviour research on the one hand, and comparative political economy and welfare state research on the other. In this way, the article highlights the advantages of connecting different academic sub-fields in studying radical right politics. First, the literature of comparative political economy on the multi-dimensionality of welfare politics can contribute to a clearer understanding of both the welfare-related causes and consequences of radical right support. Second, the party politics literature on the radical right’s ideology provides theoretical tools to explain the welfare-related consequences of populist radical right parties. The article illustrates the advantages of bridging these literatures through the empirical contributions in this special issue and concludes with avenues of future research.",Article,1.0, West European Politics,Jul 1,0,"

Producing Place-Based Masculine Subjectivities: Aspirations for Recognition and Status among Socially Mobile Vietnamese-Australian Young Men,"['Garth Stahl', 'Yang Zhao']","This article presents a longitudinal case study of five second-generation Vietnamese-Australian males experiencing the transition from boyhood to manhood. The participants reside in the same peri-urban region in Australia and come from families working in factories and restaurants or on farms and all aspire to pursue more middle-class forms of employment. Our investigation compels us to reflect on gendered identities as intercultural where place-based experiences open up opportunities for young men to gain recognition and status. Central to the analysis is how masculine subjectivities are embodied and performed as these young men navigate through different places. We draw on Bourdieu’s concepts (habitus, capital and field) to decipher how their experiences with place shape their sense of who they are as well as who they want to become. This case study complements scholarship which addresses intra-group differences in Vietnamese-Australian cultures, and how these differences are deeply influenced by access to and operationalisation of capital through sustained contact with various fields.",Article,1.0, Journal of Intercultural Studies,2h ago,0,"

Among the target compounds, 8h possessed nano-molar IC50 values toward the tested cancer cells and HDAC subtypes, which was more potent than the HDAC inhibitor SAHA (vorinostat). Mechanism study revealed that compound 8h could suppress the HepG2 cell proliferation via prompting the acetylation of histone 3 (H3) and α-tubulin, and activating the p53 signal pathway as designed. In addition, compound 8h exhibited much stronger in vivo antitumor efficacy than SAHA in the HepG2 xenograft tumor model with negligible toxicity.

These measure the spatial variation of a range ofphysical properties of the soil which may be representative proxies of the subsurfacearchaeology. Less-invasive and cost-effective field procedures have become top-priority tomitigate the destructive effects on our cultural heritage from intensified land use, climatechange and the current conflict panorama. At a time when many organisations are investing in advanced geophysical equipment, amajor problem is that our ability to fully interpret the information available from geophysical datasets is still very limited. This deficiency prevents geophysical survey moving beyond basic prospection and becoming a significant tool for answering nuanced questions about archaeology and their host landscapes. This limitation arises from an incomplete understanding of the relationship between soil properties and geophysical measurements. Bridging this gap requires multi-disciplinary teams, testing novel methods, plus scholarly discussion to collate the outcomes of projects on this topic. Overcoming these challenges is a prerequisite for maximising the costeffectiveness of geophysical methods, realising the expected benefits of technological investment and allowing broader utility of geophysical methods in the cultural heritage sector.

La Antropología Histórica como crítica cultural,['Francisco Tiapa'],"Abstract. This article presents a theoretical reflection around the methodological challenges in the study of societies where ethnic and cultural differences are intrinsic conditions, and where different logics of transformation coexist in a tense, contradictory, and mutually constitutive way. The main argument sustains that the historical glance must create a distance from its own schemes of change to approach to contexts where cultural variability is simultaneous in time and space. The main emphasis will be on the multiple otherness towards the analyst’s world of reference, the variability of time, the differences in other times and other spaces, as well as the overlapping between cultural multiplicities in the same times and spaces. In addition, there will be an argument in favour of the the relevance of the relations mutually dependants, but with contradictory horizons between different multicultural universes, to go beyond the epistemological obstacles of Unilinear History.

FDGATII : Fast Dynamic Graph Attention with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping,"['Gayan Kulatilleke', 'Marius Portmann', 'Ryan Ko', 'Shekhar Suresh Chandra']","While Graph Neural Networks have gained popularity in multiple domains, graph-structured input remains a major challenge due to (a) over-smoothing, (b) noisy neighbours (heterophily), and (c) the suspended animation problem. To address all these problems simultaneously, we propose a novel graph neural network FDGATII, inspired by attention mechanism's ability to focus on selective information supplemented with two feature preserving mechanisms. FDGATII combines Initial Residuals and Identity Mapping with the more expressive dynamic self-attention to handle noise prevalent from the neighbourhoods in heterophilic data sets. By using sparse dynamic attention, FDGATII is inherently parallelizable in design, whist efficient in operation; thus theoretically able to scale to arbitrary graphs with ease. Our approach has been extensively evaluated on 7 datasets. We show that FDGATII outperforms GAT and GCN based benchmarks in accuracy and performance on fully supervised tasks, obtaining state-of-the-art results on Chameleon and Cornell datasets with zero domain-specific graph pre-processing, and demonstrate its versatility and fairness.",Preprint,,,Dec 1,1,"

Human and Faunal Stable and Radiogenic Isotope Data from Four Bahraini and Three Jordanian Assemblages c. 5300 B.C. to 1500 AD,['Damien Huffer'],"This dataset presents carbon, nitrogen, oxygen (carbonates and phosphate) and strontium data from human and faunal remains from that portion of seven assemblages from Jordan and Bahrain currently curated at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History. Human remains from Bahraini assemblages include the Middle Islamic Period (c. 1,400-1,500 AD) cemetery associated with the Qal'at al-Bahrain fort (n=49) and the Early Dilmun City IIa-c Period (c. 2,350-1,800 BC) assemblages of Saar (n=31), Buri North (n=41) and Buri South (n=17). The Saar assemblage, at the time of sampling at the Smithsonian Institution, also included individuals recovered from isolated tombs outside the Saar mound field, with distinct alphanumeric or name designations. The Buri assemblage also contained one individual labeled BE (Buri East). Assemblages from Jordan include Early Bronze Age IB (c. 3,550-3,150 BC) Bab-edh Dhra (91 individuals selected of a total MNI of 274), the Iron Age IA (c. 1,250-1,100 BC) assemblage from a commingled cave burial from the Ba'Qa Valley (n=63), and the Late Roman (c. 200-300 AD) assemblage from Zabayir Zahir edh-Diyab, also known as the Queen Alia International Airport assemblage (n=69).

"Risk, Reliability, and the Importance of Small-Bodied Molluscs across the Hawaiian Windward-Leeward Divide","['Ashleigh J. Rogers', 'Marshall I. Weisler']","The windward-leeward dichotomy is an important biogeographical distinction when investigating prehistoric island colonisation, settlement patterns, site use, and subsistence regimes. We analysed the mollusc remains from late prehistoric windward and leeward coastal midden sites from Moloka'i, Hawaiian Islands, to understand exploitation strategies in differing environmental contexts. Analysis of molluscan remains and their associated habitats, through a patch-choice framework, indicated that, instead of practicing different foraging regimes relative to their location, windward and leeward groups targeted small Neritidae gastropods from habitats adjacent to their home site. Despite the broad environmental differences, similar subsistence strategies may have been adopted for multiple reasons. In our windward-leeward assemblages, we suggest that mollusc size is not the paramount driver of forager decision making. Through a foraging theory lens, mollusc rank is reinterpreted beyond body size in response to prey-specific biological and ecological factors, such as aggregation and predictability. We also consider that targeted exploitation of stable, reliable, and resilient prey populations may instead be indicative of a risk management strategy in marginal, high variance environments. The best explanation may be a combination of both interpretations where the risk sensitive forager ranks prey by a different set of optimality criteria that includes targeting high-density clusters of small gastropods.",Article,1.0, Human Ecology,Nov 27,1,"

Web 3.0 and future of electronic medical records,['Farzad Jahedi'],"80’s has been the starting era of using PC’s in the world and consequently in the medicine. By 2000 and popularity of web 1.0, we started the new decade of web 2.0 and social web. All these evolutions in information technology have had inevitable effect on medical information systems. 2010 and the current decade is the time for web 3.0 and semantics. Effective pass through web 3.0 will, hopefully, guide us toward web 4.0; we can call it intelligent web and subsequently intelligent medical information systems. The basic components of semantics are ontology and the knowledgebase that support the required interactions. Ontology includes lexicon and a wide variety of relationships between concepts. Internationally accepted standard ontology will be an important achievement in launching global semantics for information system. This is an ongoing project with a well-known product in medicine called “SNOMED-CT” from International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization. Around this ontological core there are different knowledgebase standards and technologies for implementation. Knowledge engineers and informaticians have different challenges in this area. There’s a wide held belief that almost all of medical data will be managed in medical information systems in less than a decade, as we can find it out in the health care provider centers around many developed and developing countries, but the next challenge will be optimum usage of this huge repository of information for the best health-care services, education and research. Although already semantics has been utilized in different levels in various electronic medical records, we have long way to use it as an applied part of our e-health system. There is a need for a gen

The relevance of basic science to stone tool use and meat eating: Standardisation of bone surface modification methods and interpretations,['Emma C. James'],"Modifications to the surfaces of fossil bones are one of the most important lines of evidence for understanding different issues in palaeoanthropological, archaeological, and taphonomic research. Bone surface modifications (BSM) are used to infer past lifeways and behaviours through site formation processes, subsistence patterns and adaptations and how they influenced human evolution, as well as patterns of economic and social evolutions. The study of BSM first appeared in palaeontology in the mid-19th Century, before gaining traction in archaeology during the processual boom of the 1960s. By identifying BSM from ethnographic studies of BSM created by people in the present day and comparing them to marks found in the archaeological record, archaeologists were able to tie traces to specific bone modifying actions (e.g. Binford 1978; Brain 1981; White 1954). However, traces left by non-human modifiers can mimic those produced by humans (e.g. Blumenschine et al. 1996; Olsen and Shipman 1988; Selvaggio 1994a; Shipman and Rose 1984). Experimental taphonomic studies in zooarchaeology have been largely conducted with the goal of confidently tying traces to known actors and effectors (Gifford-Gonzalez 1989b, 1991). However, variation in experimental design, experimental bone subjects, and how the resultant BSM are classified and analysed has contributed to a lack of consensus between researchers. For example, cut marked bones found in deposits dating to 3.39 million-years-ago (Ma) challenged the current paradigm that butchery, meat-eating behaviours and, subsequently, stone tool use were present in pre-Homo hominins (Domínguez-Rodrigo et al. 2011; McPherron et al. 2011).

Seed: Gendered Vernaculars and Relational Possibilities,"['Susannah Chapman', 'Xan Sarah Chacko']","This contribution to feminist vocabulary provides a genealogy of the term seed. We both work on practices of care and control related to seeds, from seed banking and agricultural development projects to everyday practices of keeping, saving, and tinkering with seeds. As a term, seed evokes gendered ideas about human reproduction that center masculinity and virility, even though the botanical seeds are in fact already‐fertilized embryos. This entry takes up the gendered dimension of seeds (and the elisions it produces) as a lens to interrogate ideas of use, usefulness, and uselessness (Ahmed 2019) in the world of biodiversity banking and plant genetic resources. With examples from seed banking and farming in West Africa, and with inspiration from feminist philosophers and anthropologists Sylvia Wynter, Marilyn Strathern, and Sara Ahmed, this provocation contributes to the vocabularies of feminist anthropology and science studies. Since the stories we tell about the world are filled with metaphor, why not complicate the vernacular understanding and usage of seed to reflect the queer and matrilineal possibilities that we see all around us, instead of the potent patrilineality that remains as a vestigial reminder of the values we would rather leave behind?",Article,1.0, Feminist Anthropology,Nov 14,0,"

Practitioner perspectives on the implementation of an electronic information system to enforce practice standards in England,['Philip Gillingham'],"Research in England, mainland Europe and Australia has demonstrated how the introduction of electronic information systems (IS) has been highly problematic for frontline social workers, particularly in terms of diverting their time, attention and energy away from direct work with service users. IS have evolved over the years to become increasingly complex and demanding in terms of the nature and volume of data that is required to be entered by social workers. While incorporating workflows in an IS that direct social workers to specific tasks at a particular time is not new, one recently implemented IS incorporates a plethora of workflows that aim to enforce compliance with practice procedures and standards. In this article, the findings from a small qualitative study which aimed to evaluate the reaction of social workers to this new form of IS are reported. Going beyond the problems expected with the introduction of a new IS and drawing theoretically from social informatics and joint cognitive systems, the reasons why this form of IS may be particularly problematic for frontline social workers are explored.",Article,1.0, European Journal of Social Work,,0,"

Here, we present novel ZooMS peptide markers for 24 extant marsupial and monotreme species that allow for genus-level distinctions between these species. We demonstrate the utility of these new peptide markers by using them to taxonomically identify bone fragments from a nineteenth-century colonial-era pearlshell fishery at Bandicoot Bay, Barrow Island.

The chondrocyte subclusters were classified based on their potential regulatory, homeostatic, and effector functions in extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis. Notably, in the NP, a PROCR ⁺ resident progenitor population showed enriched colony-forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) activity and trilineage differentiation capacity. Finally, intercellular crosstalk based on signaling network analysis uncovered that the PDGF and TGF-β cascades are important cues in the NP microenvironment. In conclusion, a single-cell transcriptomic atlas that resolves spatially regulated cellular heterogeneity together with the critical signaling that underlies homeostasis will help to establish new therapeutic strategies for IVD degeneration in the clinic.",Article,1.0, Bone Research,Oct 28,1,"

Targeting local lymphatics to ameliorate heterotopic ossification via FGFR3-BMPR1a pathway,"['Dali Zhang', 'Junlan Huang', 'Xianding Sun[...]', 'Yangli Xie']","Acquired heterotopic ossification (HO) is the extraskeletal bone formation after trauma. Various mesenchymal progenitors are reported to participate in ectopic bone formation. Here we induce acquired HO in mice by Achilles tenotomy and observe that conditional knockout (cKO) of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 ( FGFR3 ) in Col2 ⁺ cells promote acquired HO development. Lineage tracing studies reveal that Col2 ⁺ cells adopt fate of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) instead of chondrocytes or osteoblasts during HO development. FGFR3 cKO in Prox1 ⁺ LECs causes even more aggravated HO formation. We further demonstrate that FGFR3 deficiency in LECs leads to decreased local lymphatic formation in a BMPR1a-pSmad1/5-dependent manner, which exacerbates inflammatory levels in the repaired tendon. Local administration of FGF9 in Matrigel inhibits heterotopic bone formation, which is dependent on FGFR3 expression in LECs. Here we uncover Col2 ⁺ lineage cells as an origin of lymphatic endothelium, which regulates local inflammatory microenvironment after trauma and thus influences HO development via FGFR3-BMPR1a pathway. Activation of FGFR3 in LECs may be a therapeutic strategy to inhibit acquired HO formation via increasing local lymphangiogenesis.",Article,1.0, Nature Communications,,1,"

New insights on the reparative cells in bone regeneration and repair,"['Shuo Huang', 'Min Jin', 'su Nan', 'Lin Chen']","Bone possesses a remarkable repair capacity to regenerate completely without scar tissue formation. This unique characteristic, expressed during bone development, maintenance and injury (fracture) healing, is performed by the reparative cells including skeletal stem cells (SSCs) and their descendants. However, the identity and functional roles of SSCs remain controversial due to technological difficulties and the heterogeneity and plasticity of SSCs. Moreover, for many years, there has been a biased view that bone marrow is the main cell source for bone repair. Together, these limitations have greatly hampered our understanding of these important cell populations and their potential applications in the treatment of fractures and skeletal diseases. Here, we reanalyse and summarize current understanding of the reparative cells in bone regeneration and repair and outline recent progress in this area, with a particular emphasis on the temporal and spatial process of fracture healing, the sources of reparative cells, an updated definition of SSCs, and markers of skeletal stem/progenitor cells contributing to the repair of craniofacial and long bones, as well as the debate between SSCs and pericytes.

Exploring the politics of strain: Crime and welfare in remote Indigenous Australia,"['Zoe Staines', 'Renee Zahnow']","The international criminology and social policy literature have long explored possible connections between social welfare and crime. However, existing studies tend towards high‐level comparisons of crime versus total aggregate welfare spend, overlooking sub‐national contextual differences between and within countries. There are also few studies that deeply explore this link in the Antipodes, including in Australia: a settler colony and (neo)liberal welfare state with a recent strong coupling of punitive social and penal policies that disproportionately impact Indigenous populations. This paper attends to these gaps by examining the welfare‐crime link in remote Indigenous Queensland (Australia). We use crime‐report data and an interrupted time series design to explore the effects of dynamic social welfare policies during 2020–2021: a period that saw a temporary shift away from a strict neoliberal welfare model (i.e., heavy conditionality, low benefit rates) to more supportive and decommodifying social welfare in response to the COVID‐19 induced economic recession. Our findings align with previous studies that suggest more supportive and decommodifying policies are associated with lower crime. We also bring greater nuance to how the crime‐welfare link is understood within the ‘structural complexity of [Australian] settler colonialism’ (Wolfe. Journal of Genocide Research. 2006;8:392), by illuminating how a politics of race animates social policies that can either produce or reduce criminogenic strains and, thus, socially construct crime in the image of the Indigenous ‘Other’.",Article,1.0, Social Policy & Administration,Oct 26,0,"

Fear and Loathing in Legal Limbo: Reimagining the Refugee in Malaysian Public Discourse and History,"['Gerhard Hoffstaedter', 'Nicole Lamb']","The dominant public discourse on refugees in Malaysia is characterised by portrayals of refugees as illegal, burdensome and a threat to the nation’s security. Malaysia is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention or its related 1967 Protocol and therefore does not provide legal recognition to those who claim refugee status. Nonetheless, Malaysia is host to hundreds of thousands of refugees who live not in camp settings but in the community, most in urban environments. Refugees from Myanmar form the vast majority of Malaysia’s refugee population while smaller, though still substantial, communities are made up of refugees who originate from Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Yemen, Somalia, Iraq and Syria. This chapter interrogates key discourses around what a refugee is in Malaysia and how the dominant discourses, or what Michel Foucault calls ‘regimes of truth’, construct refugees and link them above all to the pervasive notion of ‘illegality’. The prevailing discourses pertaining to the refugee population are reiterated and shaped by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Malaysian state and its institutions, civil society, the traditional media and other consumable information systems. Here, these depictions are challenged through an exploration of alternative narratives and readings. In recent years stories of Malaysia’s refugee population have begun to emerge in the mainstream media and elsewhere. These accounts have played an important role in developing the refugee as a figure in the national consciousness.

Business or Pleasure? A Comparison of Migrant and Non-Migrant Uber Drivers in Australia,"['Pj Holtum', 'Elnaz Irannezhad', 'Greg Marston', 'Renuka Mahadevan']","Despite evidence of sub-standard working conditions and low rates of pay, drivers working on the Uber platform report varying levels of job-satisfaction. In order to better understand driver experience most research conducted to date differentiates driver experience by driver investment (time) on the platform. While this approach offers insight into driver motivations, it obfuscates key socio-political aspects of the globalised labour market; namely the precarity of many migrant workers. We present findings from a mixed methods study into migrant and non-migrant drivers on the Uber platform in Queensland, Australia. Specifically, our data illustrates key differences between migrants and non-migrants’ motivations to drive, their dependency on the platform, and their sense of autonomy and agency. Our findings suggest that migrant drivers experience greater levels of job insecurity, specifically around factors of job tenure, agency, and personal safety.",Article,1.0, Work Employment and Society,Oct 24,0,"

Silcrete is not a monolith: Heat treatment of silcrete and the economy of backed artefact manufacture,['Owen Budd'],"The use of heat treatment of silcrete and the manufacture of backed artefacts during the mid-to-late Holocene in Eastern Australia is believed to have provided considerable benefits in the use of silcrete, and the ability to produce reliable and maintainable composite toolkits. The relationship between these two technologies has been identified in the archaeological record, however a study to investigate how these two technologies function in tandem has not yet been explored systematically in Australia. This thesis will use replicative and experimental methods to heat treat a sample of silcrete sourced in Queensland and produce an assemblage of backed artefacts. The performance of heat treated silcrete, both in flake production and successful backed artefact production, will be compared against matching raw (untreated) silcrete cores from the same nodule. Analysis will seek to identify the effect of heat treatment within the reduction sequence, and the extent of variation in backed artefact size to establish the level of standardisation achieved. Results suggest that silcrete responds variably to heat treatment. Some source nodules significantly increased the volume of backed artefacts produced per core, as well as improved standardisation of backed artefacts produced to fit an ‘Ideal Backed Artefact’ prototype. However, other source nodules may have reduced backed artefact production qualities. Since heat treatment has varying effects within the reduction sequence, cultural knowledge surrounding source quality would have been a key component of prehistoric technological knowledge. This interpretation advances the argument that silcrete is not monolithic in it response to heat treatment, and therefore may have variation in its use in prehistory.",Thesis,,,Oct 18,1,"

Human enhancement drugs: Emerging issues and responses,"['Vivian D Hope', 'Mair Underwood', 'Kyle J.D. Mulrooney[...]', 'Jim Mcveigh']","It can be argued that there are no ‘enhancement’ drugs per se, for en- hancement is not an objective property of any drug but rather a meaning assigned to the drug on the basis of the expected effects of that drug. Thus all drugs could be enhancement drugs if deemed to be, for the def- inition of enhancement depends on the meaning we, as a society, give to the drugs’ effects. If a drugs’ effects are deemed to be detrimental that drug may be considered a ‘poison’ or ‘toxin’. If the effects of a drug are deemed valuable or beneficial, and the drug is used to restore or sustain ‘health’ or ‘normality’, the drug may be deemed ‘therapeutic’ or a ‘medicine’. If the effects of the drugs are experienced as beneficial but those benefits are not seen as necessary to restore or sustain health, these drugs may be deemed ‘recreational’ (if the drug is used primarily for ‘pleasure’) or ‘enhancing’. Whether or not drug use is considered en- hancement depends in large part on our definition of ‘normality’, and on what we, as a society, value. The term ‘enhancement’ refers to changes that are considered to be in a positive direction, that is, they are ‘im- provements’ or changes that are viewed as increasing value, and that alter an individual to a state which society has deemed above ‘normal’. Enhancement is commonly defined by bioethicists as “interventions that are used to improve human form or functioning beyond what is necessary to restore or sustain health” (Juengst & Moseley, 2019). However, whilst there are established definitions of ‘health’, such as the WHO “Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”, these are typically broad and so open to interpretation (e.g. is it merely repair and maintenance or

Etnología de Venezuela,['Francisco Tiapa'],"Venezuela es un país multiétnico y pluricultural, donde actualmente se hablan más de treinta y seis idiomas indígenas, además de mantenerse una extraordinaria diversidad de costumbres y creencias derivadas de los procesos de hibridación cultural de los últimos cinco siglos. Su configuración actual, no sólo integra a diversos pueblos indígenas, sino a una amplia gama de poblaciones afrodescendientes, asiáticas y mestizas. Al estar ubicado en la confluencia de las macrorregiones del Caribe, la Amazonía y los Andes, este país también presenta una singular diversidad ecológica, que ha derivado en su correspondiente heterogeneidad de procesos adaptativos. Así, el territorio de lo que ocupa actualmente a Venezuela ha sido el ámbito de un amplio conjunto de grupos étnicos pertenecientes a las familias lingüísticas, Chibcha, Arawak, Caribe, Warao, Sáliva, Pumé, Hiwi y a una serie familias lingüísticas independientes, descendientes de las primeras oleadas migratorias que llegaron a nuestro continente. Estas poblaciones han pasado por un proceso histórico de adaptación a las diferentes formas de expansión europea y criolla. A lo largo de este proceso histórico, se ha sucedido una serie de oleadas de imposición colonial y neo-colonial, dirigidas a la construcción de una sociedad cultural y étnicamente homogénea. Entre los siglos XVI y XVII, las poblaciones indígenas fueron el objeto imposición de regímenes de esclavitud y encomiendas, dirigidos a la explotación de su mano de obra por la fuerza. A partir de mediados del siglo XVII y el transcurso del siglo XVIII, el sistema de misiones católicas estuvo dirigido al adoctrinamiento religioso de las poblaciones indígenas, como política de asimilación cultural.

"The Osteology and Provenance of the Parkinson Collection, Gazelle Peninsula, New Britain, c. 1897",['Damien Huffer'],"This article presents the results of combined osteological and archival research into the demographics, preservation condition, taphonomy, pathology, cultural modification and collecting history of the Parkinson collection of human crania from New Britain, collected c. 1897, and currently housed in the Etnografiska Museet (Ethnography Museum), Stockholm, Sweden. This assemblage of crania (n=45) was acquired by one Richard Heinrich Robert Parkinson (1844‐1909), a Danish explorer and anthropologist initially in the employ of the Hamburg based J. C Goddefroy & Sohn in Samoa trading firm. In 1897, after independently settling on the Gazelle Peninsula of New Britain with his family and beginning to make collecting trips to local communities and those on neighboring islands, this collection of crania eventually came to reside at its present location. This article provides the first in‐depth analysis of the osteology of this collection contextualized within what is known and knowable about its ownership history and movement between collection and arrival in Stockholm. This includes translation of previously untranslated German documents that provide heretofore undisclosed information about Parkinson’s collecting activities. Osteological analysis includes age and sex estimation, taphonomic modification as an indicator of initial depositional environment, discussion of select examples of pathology and trauma, and the comparative analysis of decorative motifs (where present). Results indicate a primarily young adult male assemblage, but with all major age classes and both sexes present. Incidents of trauma and pathology are low, but some unique examples are highlighted.

Surprise Reveals the Affective-Moral Economies in Cancer Illness Narratives,"['Stefanie Plage', 'Rebecca E Olson']","Emotions, like joy and sorrow, feature in illness narratives, dramatizing stories of becoming: sick, well, controlled, in control. However, brief emotions, such as surprise, have received limited analytic attention in cancer illness narratives. Drawing on 20 interviews with 11 participants with diverse cancer diagnoses, along with the 455 photographs they produced for this study, we address the complex interactions between discourse, societal expectations, and perceptions in moral-affective economies. Tracing the emergence, deployment, and silencing of surprise provided an avenue to explore connections between affect, morality, advocacy, and philanthropy. We show how surprise works to deny uncertainties couched in individual risk, and situate cancer causation within the logics of anticipation, (re)producing socio-cultural etiology narratives. Attending to surprise reveals how some cancers are situated as individual responsibilities, with restricted access to compassion and collective resources. Thus, we interrogate the affective-moral economy underpinning cancer illness narratives, and surprise’s pivotal role in its analysis.",Article,1.0, Qualitative Health Research,Oct 11,0,"

Teoría y Métodos de la Etnografía,['Francisco Tiapa'],"A lo largo de la historia de las Ciencias Humanas, se han creado marcos epistemológicamente unificados al mismo tiempo que se han consolidado las esferas de especialización de cada disciplina. Así, en casi dos siglos se ha creado un proceso doble donde, cada esfera de conocimiento, desde su ámbito concreto de aplicación, ha construido teorías, métodos y descubrimientos empíricos que han nutrido los supuestos básicos de las Ciencias en general, sean estas naturales, sociales o humanidades. Por ejemplo, desde la Psicología, la idea de inconsciente impactó las teorías sobre la mente humana y, por su parte, la Sociología fundó su campo de conocimiento gracias al principio de que no hay comportamiento, por individual que parezca, que no tenga una determinación social. La Historia, a su vez, nos ha enseñado que cada época debe ser entendida según sus propios términos y no desde nuestros prejuicios creados en el presente. Con un sentido similar, desde la Antropología, el principio de que cada cultura piensa y actúa sobre el mundo de manera relativa y desde su propia vivencia pasó a nutrir esta amalgama de conceptos y de fundamentos epistemológicos. Como una derivación de este supuesto teórico, el método etnográfico-en principio el método específico de la Etnología, como subdisciplina de la Antropología-pasó a constituirse como un método cualitativo epistemológicamente sólido, admitido y empleado en el resto de las ciencias humanas. Dado que se parte del principio de la aprehensión del punto de vista del nativo, se sostiene que sólo la experiencia sostenida, rutinaria y gradual de la observación participante es capaz de acceder a esta perspectiva de la re

Diálogos Interdisciplinares en las Ciencias Sociales,['Francisco Tiapa'],"Las discusiones contemporáneas sobre la necesidad de apertura de diálogos inter-disciplinarios en las Ciencias Sociales, han llevado a una profunda revisión de los procesos históricos que ha creado, así como y las bases epistemológicas que sustentan a las barreras entre diferentes ámbitos de conocimientos. Así, se ha puesto en discusión la validez de estas fronteras entre campos de conocimiento a partir de la puesta en evidencia de la fragilidad de sus sustentos intelectuales. Esto ha sido especialmente patente en las discusiones en torno al sustrato colonial de las bases del así llamado pensamiento moderno y de los criterios clasificatorios de los diferentes espectros de la realidad. Sobre la base de la idea de la diferencia entre sujeto y objeto, por ejemplo, se ha creado un amplio conjunto de divisiones dicotómicas en torno a las cuales se ha estratificado la valoración de las diferentes formas de condiciones humanas y no humanas que han sido ""objeto de estudio"" de las ciencias modernas. Como un derivado de este amplio sistema taxonómico del saber, se ha creado la imagen de una realidad sustantiva y esencialmente diferente entre el ""nosotros"" europeo y los ""otros"" no europeos, entre el presente y el pasado y hasta entre los ámbitos de la sociedad civil, la política y la economía. En suma, se han creado escisiones de la realidad que han llegado al punto de presentar a las barreras disciplinarias, históricamente creadas, como si fuesen realidades sustancialmente dadas.

Antropologia Historica,['Francisco Tiapa'],"En el contexto global contemporáneo, la ruptura de barreras disciplinares es cada vez más necesaria. La Antropología orientada al estudio de las sociedades del presente se ha caracterizado por el conocimiento y comprensión de los universos culturales ajenos o subalternos al llamado Mundo Occidental. De esta manera, a lo largo de su recorrido disciplinar, la Antropología ha pasado por diversas fases, según los momentos históricos en los que se han encontrado sus productores. Si bien en sus principios fue el justificativo de la expansión colonial de Europa, en el presente se ha constituido como la principal herramienta discursiva de reivindicación de las maneras de ver al mundo alternas a lo impuesto por la modernidad industrial. Tal potencialidad de la Antropología como herramienta de contestación de las subalternidades del Sistema Mundo Moderno también se ha volcado hacia el rescate y reivindicación de las historias olvidadas por la llamada Historia Oficial. Desde la Historia, como disciplina, la apertura hacia las Ciencias Sociales ha desembocado en una preocupación por la reconstrucción del pasado de las poblaciones comúnmente olvidadas por las agendas de trabajo más tradicionales. Este lugar común ha llevado a la elaboración de agendas de trabajo con fines concretos de incorporación de la diversidad cultural del pasado, así como de las diversas formas en que este pasado puede ser entendido.

Teoria del desarrollo sociopolitico de Venezuela,['Francisco Tiapa'],"En toda sociedad, la forma en que se piensa y se practica la política está enmarcada en un modelo ideal de vida correspondiente con una dinámica social enmarcada en un modelo cultural variable en tiempo y en espacio. En tal sentido, para comprender como se forman las relaciones y las estructuras de poder, es prioritario entender cuales son esos modelos ideales. El proceso de formación sociopolítica de Venezuela está directamente vinculado con su posicionamiento dentro del Sistema Mundo Moderno, configurado con la expansión colonial de Europa y la consecuente formación de Estados Nacionales post-coloniales. Al igual que el resto de las naciones formadas dentro de esta condición, en Venezuela se formó una sociedad de clases, donde la verticalidad se define según la adherencia al modelo cultural impuesto desde los centros hegemónicos globales, estén estos en Europa o en los Estados Unidos. En esta estructura, los descendientes culturales de los europeos han definido e impuesto el patrón social y los distintos proyectos de Estado, como un horizonte a seguir, creando así una suerte de utopía nunca alcanzada. De este modo, la relación entre las clases dominantes y el resto de los sectores sociales se ha definido por una dinámica en la que los primeros han llevado a cabo distintos proyectos civilizatorios, orientados a la homogeneización cultural de la sociedad venezolana, mientras que los segundos, según el momento histórico, o bien han aceptado este patrón o bien han generado diversas formas de organización social para poder tener continuidad histórica dentro de este orden cargado de tensiones y contradicciones.

The pharmaceuticalisation of ‘healthy’ ageing: Testosterone enhancement for longevity,"['Matthew Dunn', 'Kyle J.D. Mulrooney', 'Cynthia Forlini[...]', 'Mair Underwood']","The United Nations estimates that the world's population will reach 8.5 billion by 2030, and the populations of most countries are expected to grow older. This is case for many developed countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States of America, and member states of the European Union. Older cohorts will comprise a larger proportion of overall populations, driven in part by our increases in life expectancy. An ageing population poses challenges for governments; notably, older people tend to have multiple, chronic health conditions which can place a burden of health budgets. At the same time, we are witnessing a shift in how we respond to the health needs of our populations, with global drug policy acknowledging that some substances are contributing to increased morbidity and mortality (e.g. opioids) while others may have beneficial therapeutic effects (e.g. psylocibin, cannabis). There is general agreement that as men age their levels of testosterone decrease, and there is some evidence to suggest that there have been population-level declines in testosterone which are not associated with age. Anecdotally, testosterone is accessed by men seeking to self-medicate in the belief that they are experiencing low testosterone levels. There has also been a rise in anti-ageing clinics in the United States, providing access to testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). The non-medical use of testosterone can result in a number of adverse health events, including complications from the use of black market or underground products. Placing testosterone under a new prescribing regime may address some of these concerns, but is society ready for this change, and if so, what would this regime loo

Underwood. 2020. Testing the boundaries Self-medicated testosterone replacement and why it is practised,"['Mair Underwood', 'Katinka Van de Ven', 'Matthew Dunn']","Background: Testosterone is used therapeutically in medical settings. Non-prescribed testosterone use is typically illegal, described as ‘enhancement’ or ‘doping’, and considered a problem. However, research has found that some non-prescribed testosterone use may be therapeutic (i.e. self-medication). Little is known about testosterone self- medication. It has been noted among individuals who use image and performance enhancing drugs (IPEDs), but never systematically explored. Approach: This paper describes the findings of a 4-year ethnographic study in online forums and social media groups frequented by people who use IPEDs. It focusses on 31 men who used enhancement doses of testosterone, but who described some of their testosterone use as ‘testosterone replacement therapy’ (TRT). In particular, it focuses on the 26 (84%) of these individuals who self-medicated TRT. Data was analysed thematically (using NVivo) in order to answer the question: ‘how and why is testosterone self-medicated?’. Using Bacchi’s (2016) prob- lematization approach to policy analysis, this paper also asks, ‘what happens to the ‘problem’ of non-prescribed testosterone use if such use is therapeutic?’. Findings: Self-medicated TRT was found to be very similar to TRT as practised in medical contexts. Self- medication was often practised because of an inability to access testosterone through health practitioners (who were either reluctant or unable to prescribe). However, some individuals were found to prefer self-medication because of price, ease of access, reliability of supply, and because health practitioners were perceived as lacking expertise regarding testosterone use. Conclusion: By documenting the therapeutic use of test

An Australian newspaper campaign and government vaccination policy An Australian newspaper campaign and government vaccination policy,['Julia LeMonde'],"News Corp Australia recently initiated a campaign to pressure the Australian government to amend its childhood vaccination policies. In 2015, the government legislated amendments in accord with the campaign's demands despite criticism from experts in children's health and vaccine advocacy, research and surveillance. A narrative review was conducted of newsprint articles which featured during the media campaign between 2013 and 2015. Findings indicate that the campaign focused on moral attributes that stigmatised conscientious objector parents as 'anti-vaxers', baby-killers, and hippies and loons. The decision to change vaccination legislation is compatible with the creation of a media-manufactured moral panic concerning conscientious objector parents. When deconstructing moral panics, a careful analysis of the roles of different media sectors is important. The alliance between News Corp Australia and Australian politicians to introduce new vaccination legislation represents an innovation in health policy formation which illustrates how expert opinion on public health policies can be sidelined.",Article,1.0, Prometheus,Sep 20,0,"

How effective is conditional welfare support for enhancing child wellbeing?

Conditional welfare in Australia involves compulsory income management (CIM), comprising the quarantining of between 50 and 90 per cent of a participant’s welfare payment for use on food, rent and other essential items. A major objective of all Australian income management (IM) programs since 2007 has been to enhance children’s wellbeing by protecting them from harm caused by anti-social behaviour such as alcohol and drug abuse, and ensuring they have access to basic needs such as food, education and health care. To explore the outcomes of these objectives, this qualitative study explores the views of both compulsory and voluntary IM participants as well as community stakeholders in relation to child wellbeing in four IM locations across Australia. It finds minimal evidence to support the view that IM contributes to positive outcomes in children’s welfare.",Article,1.0, Children and Youth Services Review,Sep 19,0,"

Afflexivity in post-qualitative inquiry: prioritising affect and reflexivity in the evaluation of a health information website,"['Jenny Setchell', 'Rebecca E Olson', 'Merrill Turpin[...]', 'Paul W Hodges']","Increasingly, people turn to online sources for health information, creating human-non-human relationalities. Health websites are considered accessible in scope and convenience but can have limited capacity to accommodate complexities. There are concerns about who gets to ‘assemble’ with these resources, and who is excluded. Guided by Ahmed’s socio-political theories of emotions, we questioned our feelings as we intra-acted with a consumer information website about back pain (MyBackPain). This encouraged us to approach resource evaluation in a way that alters conventional rational/cognitive judgement processes. Our inquiry was ‘supra-disciplinary’ involving public health, sociology, allied health and consumer collaborators. Specifically, we considered relationality – the feelings circulating between bodies/objects and implicated in MyBackPain’s affective practices; impressions – the marks, images or beliefs MyBackPain makes on bodies/objects; and directionality – how these intra-actions pushed in some directions and away from others. Although Ahmed would likely not consider herself ‘post-humanist’, we argue that her socio-political theories of how objects and emotions entangle are of great interest to furthering critical post-human understandings of health. Rather than threatening decision-making, we suggest that feelings (and their affects) are central to it. The article demonstrates the productive potential of critical post-human inquiry in identifying/countering ‘othering’ possibilities, and catalysing a ‘nomadic shift’ towards new human-non-human formations.",Article,1.0, Health Sociology Review,Sep 14,0,"

Factor structure of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Australian Vietnam Veterans: confirmatory factor analysis of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM–5,"['John Gilmour', 'Madeline Romaniuk']","Introduction: The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM–5) brought a change to the symptom clusters of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In line with the DSM–5 changes, an updated version of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS–5) was released. The CAPS–5 is considered to be the gold-standard measure of PTSD; however, examinations of the psychometric properties and optimal factor structure of this scale are underrepresented in PTSD studies. Methods: This study used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to assess the factor structure of the CAPS–5 using a sample of 267 male Australian Vietnam Veterans. Models drawn from the PTSD CFA literature were used to test the underlying dimensions of PTSD: the four-factor DSM–5 model, six-factor externalizing behaviour and anhedonia models, and seven-factor hybrid model. Results: The results found that the DSM–5 model showed slightly less than adequate fit (comparative fit index [CFI] = 0.90, Tucker–Lewis index [TLI] = 0.88, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.064), however, other models showed acceptable fit. The anhedonia model provided a significantly better fit than the other models (CFI = 0.92, TLI = 0.90, RMSEA = 0.059). Discussion: Overall, the results supported the anhedonia model. This result may indicate that the underlying dimensions of PTSD in Australian Vietnam Veterans may best be represented by six distinct factors.",Article,0.0, Journal of Military Veteran and Family Health,Sep 8,0,"

A qualitative case study of poor informal settlements was conducted in Rajshahi Bangladesh, to investigate a greater right to the city as the result of a ‘citizens charter’ initiated by local government. This research focusses on the poorest of the poor, who are often overlooked in community-based research due to their inability to attract the support of NGOs and donors means they are particularly vulnerable to this system of urban patron-clientism. We find that attempts by the city government to improve services to the poorest of its citizens is hampered by entrenched patron client practices perpetuated by local political representatives of the city government acting as gatekeepers, blocking access to services for the urban poor.",Article,1.0, Forum for Development Studies,Sep 5,0,"

Triaging online child abuse material: testing a decision support tool to enhance law enforcement and investigative prioritisation,"['David Mount', 'Lorraine Mazerolle', 'Renee Zahnow', 'Leisa James']","Purpose Online production and transmission of child abuse material (CAM) is a complex and growing global problem. The exponential increase in the volume of CyberTips of CAM offending is placing information processing and decision-making strains on law enforcement. This paper presents the outcomes of a project that reviewed an existing risk assessment tool and then developed a new tool for CAM triaging and investigative prioritisation. Design/methodology/approach Using a mixed method approach, the authors first explored the capacity of an existing risk assessment tool for predicting a police action. The authors then used these findings to design and implement a replacement CAM decision support tool. Using a random sample of CyberTip alert cases from 2018, the authors then tested the efficiency of the new tool. Findings The existing risk assessment tool was not fit for CAM triaging purposes. Just six questions from the old tool were found to be statistically and significantly associated with law enforcement agents achieving a police action. The authors found that an immediate threat of abuse/endangering a child, potential case solvability, CAM image assessment, chat assessment, criticality and some weighting for professional judgement were significant in being associated with a police action. The new decision support tool is more efficient to complete and achieved a 93.6% convergence of risk ratings with the old tool using 2018 case data. Originality/value This research is unique in its development of an evidence-based decision support tool that enhances the ability of law enforcement agents to objectively and efficiently triage and prioritise increasing numbers of CyberTip alerts.",Article,1.0, Policing An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management,Aug 31,0,"

"Revisiting Kalundu Mound, Zambia: Implications for the Timing of Social and Subsistence Transitions in Iron Age Southern Africa","['Steven Goldstein', 'Alison Crowther', 'Edward Henry[...]', 'Nicole Boivin']","Novel trajectories of food production, urbanism, and inter-regional trade fueled the emergence of numerous complex Iron Age polities in central and southern Africa. Renewed research and re-dating efforts in Botswana, Zimbabwe, and along the Swahili Coast are transforming models for how inter-regional interaction spheres contributed to these patterns. While societies in present-day Zambia played an important role in the trade of copper, ivory, gold, and other resources between central and southern Africa, little is known about lifeways during the rise of social complexity in this region. This paper reports the results of re-excavation at Kalundu Mound on the Batoka Plateau of southern Zambia, one of the iconic mound sites of the Iron Age “Kalomo Culture.” New radiocarbon dates were combined with the original dates in a series of Bayesian models, indicating that previous chronologies for the site are not reliable and that the mound site likely developed rapidly from AD 1190 to 1410. Archaeobotanical, zooarchaeological, and paleo-proteomic analyses of excavated materials suggests a broad subsistence base combining wild and domesticated species, including the first reported evidence for finger millet (Eleusine coracana) in the region. Considering these findings, it is necessary to re-evaluate the temporal context of the Kalomo site-group, and to also systematically reinvestigate the systems of exchange and subsistence that supported Later Iron Age complexity.",Article,1.0, African Archaeological Review,Aug 30,1,"

Within Africa, discussions of these issues have largely been based on the archaeological record from the south and northeast of the continent, with little evidence from eastern coastal areas leaving significant spatial and temporal gaps in our knowledge. Here, we present data from Panga ya Saidi, a limestone cave complex located 15 km from the modern Kenyan coast, which represents the first long-term sequence of coastal engagement from eastern Africa. Rather than attempting to distinguish between coastal resource use and coastal adaptations, we focus on coastal engagement as a means of characterising human relationships with marine environments and resources from this inland location. We use aquatic mollusc data spanning the past 67,000 years to document shifts in the acquisition, transportation, and discard of these materials, to better understand long-term trends in coastal engagement. Our results show pulses of coastal engagement beginning with low-intensity symbolism, and culminating in the consistent low-level transport of marine and freshwater food resources, emphasising a diverse relationship through time. Panga ya Saidi has the oldest stratified evidence of marine engagement in eastern Africa, and is the only site in Africa which documents coastal resources from the Late Pleistocene through the Holocene, highlighting the potential archaeological importance of peri-coastal sites to debates abou

Papua New Guinean Genomes Reveal the Complex Settlement of North Sahul,"['Nicolas Brucato', 'Mathilde André', 'Roxanne Tsang[...]', 'Francois X Ricaut']","The settlement of Sahul, the lost continent of Oceania, remains one of the most ancient and debated human migrations. Modern New Guineans inherited a unique genetic diversity tracing back 50,000 years, and yet there is currently no model reconstructing their past population dynamics. We generated 58 new whole genome sequences from Papua New Guinea, filling geographical gaps in previous sampling, specifically to address alternative scenarios of the initial migration to Sahul and the settlement of New Guinea. Here, we present the first genomic models for the settlement of northeast Sahul considering one or two migrations from Wallacea. Both models fit our dataset, reinforcing the idea that ancestral groups to New Guinean and Indigenous Australians split early, potentially during their migration in Wallacea where the northern route could have been favored. The earliest period of human presence in Sahul was an era of interactions and gene flow between related but already differentiated groups, from whom all modern New Guineans, Bismarck islanders and Indigenous Australians descend. The settlement of New Guinea was probably initiated from its southeast region, where the oldest archaeological sites have been found. This was followed by two migrations into the south and north lowlands that ultimately reached the west and east highlands. We also identify ancient gene flows between populations in New Guinea, Australia, East Indonesia and the Bismarck Archipelago, emphasizing the fact that the anthropological landscape during the early period of Sahul settlement was highly dynamic rather than the traditional view of extensive isolation.",Article,1.0, Molecular Biology and Evolution,Aug 15,1,"

"Rock engravings and occupation sites in the Mount Bosavi Region, Papua New Guinea: Implications for our understanding of the human presence in the Southern Highlands","['Lara Lamb', 'Bryce Barker', 'Matthew Leavesley[...]', 'Tiina Manne']","en An extensive body of engraved rock art on the Great Papuan Plateau is documented here for the first time, along with the first dates for occupation. Consisting largely of deeply abraded or pecked barred ovals and cupules, the rock art of this region does not fit comfortably into any regional models for rock art previously described. It does, however, exhibit some similarity to art in regions to the east and the west of the plateau. Subject to further archaeological testing, we present a number of exploratory hypotheses with which to explain the presence of the engravings; as part of the ethnographic and contemporary Kasua's cultural suite; as part of a relatively recent (late Holocene) migration of peoples from the Gulf to the plateau; or as part of an earlier movement of people from the west, possibly as part of the movement of people into the Sahul continent in the Late Pleistocene. We conclude that the Great Papuan Plateau is not a late and marginally occupied ‘backwater’ but rather part of a possible corridor of human movement across northern Sahul and a region that could allow us to better understand modern humans as they reached the Sahul continent.

Criminal careers and restorative justice,['Sarah Bennett'],"In 2004, the Justice Research Consortium (JRC) completed a randomised controlled trial testing the crime reduction effects of restorative justice conferences. Burglary and robbery offenders and victims who agreed to participate in the trial were randomly assigned to either a face to face conference (experimental) in addition to normal court processing or to a control condition where their case proceeded as usual through London's Crown Courts. Restorative justice has been shown to be effective at reducing reoffending in some contexts. More research is needed, however, to determine why some individuals taking part in restorative justice desist from offending whilst others reoffend quickly. Research suggests that individual characteristics such as gender, race and age, criminal history features such as frequency, seriousness, and custody, and ancillary factors such as drug use and victimization can have an impact on offending, and this thesis investigates the extent to which these variables predict time to reoffending. Using survival analysis, this thesis also explores whether, in a sample of serious adult offenders, the effects of restorative justice on time to reoffending are different at different values of these variables. Key findings include: o In the burglary experiment, female offenders reoffended significantly faster than males, and females in the control condition reoffended twice as fast as females in the experimental condition. o The higher the frequency of arrests or convictions, and/or the greater the seriousness of offending prior to random assignment, the faster project offenders reoffended. This effect was significant in the burglary experiment. o Highly frequent and highly serious offenders (based on criminal history prior to random a

Wright, Nicole Boivin and Alison Crowther Published:28 July 2021https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.202341 Review history Abstract The human colonization of eastern Africa's near- and offshore islands was accompanied by the translocation of several domestic, wild and commensal fauna, many of which had long-term impacts on local environments. To better understand the timing and nature of the introduction of domesticated caprines (sheep and goat) to these islands, this study applied collagen peptide fingerprinting (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry or ZooMS) to archaeological remains from eight Iron Age sites, dating between ca 300 and 1000 CE, in the Zanzibar, Mafia and Comoros archipelagos. Where previous zooarchaeological analyses had identified caprine remains at four of these sites, this study identified goat at seven sites and sheep at three, demonstrating that caprines were more widespread than previously known. The ZooMS results support an introduction of goats to island eastern Africa from at least the seventh century CE, while sheep in our sample arrived one–two centuries later. Goats may have been preferred because, as browsers, they were better adapted to the islands' environments. The results allow for a more accurate understanding of early caprine husbandry in the study region and provide a critical archaeological baseli

‘I want to sleep at night as well’: Guilt and care in the making of agricultural credit markets,"['Zannie Langford', 'Alana Brekelmans', 'Geoffrey Alan Lawrence']","In the pastoral lands of Northern Australia, properties are typically very large and remote, and experience severe fluctuations in land values and unpredictable environmental patterns. Most pastoralists are financed by bank credit, which is an important tool for managing business development plans and responding to situations of drought and changes in market conditions. This credit is serviced by a small group of professional agri-finance bankers who often reside in the region and develop long-term relationships with their clients. In this chapter, we explore the role of these relationships between pastoral landholders and bankers in shaping and moderating credit markets. We show that these relationships are not only symptomatic but also generative of moral economies in agricultural credit markets. Our evidence suggests that relationship lending may not only increase access to credit during economic contractions, as has been previously reported, but may also decrease access to credit during economic expansions. These relationships mediate the effects of global capital markets on Northern Australian pastoralism, influencing patterns of financing in the region. This contributes to understandings of financialisation as assembled by a diverse range of work by both financial and non-financial actors, whose interactions contribute to and resist financialising patterns in often unpredictable ways. https://www.routledge.com/Markets-in-their-Place-Context-Culture-Finance/Prince-Henry-Morris-Gallagher-FitzHerbert/p/book/9780367273408",Preprint,,,Jul 26,0,"

Phenotypic differences between highlanders and lowlanders in Papua New Guinea,"['Mathilde André', 'Nicolas Brucato', 'Sébastien Plutniak[...]', 'Francois X Ricaut']","Objectives: Altitude is one of the most demanding environmental pressures for human populations. Highlanders from Asia, America and Africa have been shown to exhibit different biological adaptations, but Oceanian populations remain understudied [Woolcock et al., 1972; Cotes et al., 1974; Senn et al., 2010]. We tested the hypothesis that highlanders phenotypically differ from lowlanders in Papua New Guinea, as a result of inhabiting the highest mountains in Oceania for at least 20,000 years. Materials and methods: We collected data for 13 different phenotypes related to altitude for 162 Papua New Guineans living at high altitude (Mont Wilhelm, 2,300-2,700 m above sea level (a.s.l.) and low altitude (Daru, <100m a.s.l.). Multilinear regressions were performed to detect differences between highlanders and lowlanders for phenotypic measurements related to body proportions, pulmonary function, and the circulatory system. Results: Six phenotypes were significantly different between Papua New Guinean highlanders and lowlanders. Highlanders show shorter height (p-value = 0.001), smaller waist circumference (p-value = 0.002), larger Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) (p-value = 0.008), larger maximal (p-value = 3.20e -4) and minimal chest depth (p-value = 2.37e -5) and higher haemoglobin concentration (p-value = 3.36e -4). Discussion: Our study reports specific phenotypes in Papua New Guinean highlanders potentially related to altitude adaptation. Similar to other human groups adapted to high altitude, the evolutionary history of Papua New Guineans appears to have also followed an adaptive biological strategy for altitude.",Article,1.0, PLoS ONE,Jul 25,1,"

Strong communities and justice practices in the Torres Strait Region,"['John Scott', 'Zoe Staines', 'James Morton']","This article examines crime prevention practices in the Torres Strait Region (TSR), where relatively low crime rates challenge the association of discrete Indigenous communities with crime ‘problems’ and also test other criminological assumptions around crime. Drawing on 27 interviews with justice professionals and social workers in the TSR, we account for the resilience of a ‘shame culture’ in the region, which provides for a high level of social integration and sustains crime prevention practices, such as cultural mediation. Thus, we argue that while economic indicators such as wealth and employment show high levels of disadvantage in the TSR, indicators of strong social capital provide an explanation for low crime rates. We conclude that social capital is translated into local crime prevention practices that are unique to the TSR and reinforce the importance of cultural continuity and autonomy.",Article,1.0, Journal of Sociology,Jul 24,1,"

Automated Annotation of Cell Identities in Dense Cellular Images,"['Shivesh Chaudhary', 'Sol Ah Lee', 'Yueyi Li[...]', 'Hang Lu']","Assigning cell identities in dense image stacks is critical for many applications, for comparing data across animals and experiment conditions, and investigating properties of specific cells. Conventional methods are laborious, require experience, and could introduce bias. We present a generalizable framework based on Conditional Random Fields models for automatic cell identification. This approach searches for optimal arrangements of labels that maximally preserves prior knowledge such as geometrical relationships. The algorithm shows better accuracy and more robust handling of perturbations, e.g. missing cells and position variability, with both synthetic and experimental ground-truth data. The framework is generalizable across strains, imaging conditions, and easily builds and utilizes active data-driven atlases, which further improves accuracy. We demonstrate the utility in gene-expression pattern analysis, multi-cellular calcium imaging, and whole-brain imaging experiments. Thus, our framework is highly valuable to a wide variety of annotation scenarios including in zebrafish, Drosophila, hydra, and mouse brains.",Preprint,,,Jul 22,1,"

Here we present a probabilistic-graphical-model framework, CRF_ID, based on Conditional Random Fields, for unbiased and automated cell identification. CRF_ID focuses on maximizing intrinsic similarity between shapes. Compared to existing methods, CRF_ID achieves higher accuracy on simulated and ground-truth experimental datasets, and better robustness against challenging noise conditions common in experimental data. CRF_ID can further boost accuracy by building atlases from annotated data in highly computationally efficient manner, and by easily adding new features (e.g. from new strains). We demonstrate cell annotation in C. elegans images across strains, animal orientations, and tasks including gene-expression localization, multi-cellular and whole-brain functional imaging experiments. Together, these successes demonstrate that unbiased cell annotation can facilitate biological discovery, and this approach may be valuable to annotation tasks for other systems.",Article,1.0, eLife Sciences,,1,"

"Counter-terrorism measures and perceptions of police legitimacy: The importance Muslims place on procedural justice, representative bureaucracy, and bounded-authority concerns","['Mohammed M. Ali', 'Kristina Murphy', 'Adrian Cherney']","Engaging Muslims in counter-terrorism (CT) has proved challenging for police worldwide. Some research has focussed on the utility of police being procedurally just in their CT strategies to enhance their legitimacy and subsequent cooperation from Muslims. Despite the efficacy of procedural justice, however, some have argued that procedural justice scholarship is too narrowly focussed on how police treat citizens. Citizens’ concerns about police acting within the limits of appropriate power (i.e., “bounded-authority” concerns), as well as representativeness in policing (i.e., “representative bureaucracy”), can also influence citizens’ judgments of police legitimacy. This study explores how, when, and why procedural justice, bounded authority, and representation concerns shape Muslims’ perceptions of police CT measures and police legitimacy. Using focus group data from 104 Australian-Muslims, results revealed that CT measures that include Muslims as partners in terrorism prevention and those that draw on principles of procedural justice were perceived most favourably, and were seen to promote police legitimacy. Measures that were condemned were perceived as bounded-authority violations and damaged police legitimacy. Implications for theory and police practice are discussed.",Article,,,Jul 18,0,"

This is the first rock art site to be recorded in Mithaka Country, which is in a part of Australia's sandy deserts where rock art is uncommon. Gilparrka Almira is placed within a broader social context by exploring its possible cultural connections with other sites and regions. Regional comparisons of the main motif type found that proportions decreased in all directions away from the site. Possible meanings for crescent imagery are then examined from ethnohistorical sources, indicating that crescent motifs may bear a range of “discontinuous” meanings that can be used in different contexts. It is suggested that crescent motifs may have moved/diffused across vast areas of the continent, following the north-south Lake Eyre Basin trade network, with Mithaka Country lying at its approximate centre, and other (east-west) trade routes, along the Dreaming tracks with which the trade routes are frequently associated. Motifs with “discontinuous” meaning ranges, like crescents, would have been particularly suitable for use in this scenario because of their ability to be readily incorporated into different social contexts.

Procedural justice scholars argue that people cooperate with police when they feel the police are just and fair because such treatment motivates identification with social categories that police represent. In this paper, we consider whether immigrants in Australia respond favourably to procedurally just treatment from police because it enhances their identification with both Australia and the police. Using survey data from 903 Vietnamese, Middle Eastern and British immigrants, we demonstrate an association between police procedural justice and both modes of identification. We also find that both identities mediate the relationship between procedural justice and cooperation.

Identifying marsupials from Australian archaeological sites: current methodological challenges and opportunities in zooarchaeological practice,"['Erin Mein', 'Tiina Manne']","en We review current zooarchaeological practice in Australia, identifying major research themes and key methodological gaps where opportunities exist for the development of Australian zooarchaeology as a discipline. We demonstrate that marsupial remains form a significant component of Australian zooarchaeological assemblages, yet high resolution taxonomic identification of these remains continues to prove challenging, owing to a combination of high species diversity and few resources which provide diagnostic criteria for discriminating morphologically similar, but ecologically variable taxa. The lack of robust protocols for discriminating marsupial taxa significantly impacts our ability to effectively integrate zooarchaeological data into broader narratives of Aboriginal colonisation, resilience and adaptation across Australia. Publication of identification protocols would help refine and standardise diagnostic criteria used between analysts, improve the methodological transparency of zooarchaeological analysis and provide resources for the training of a new generation of specialists.

"Neighbourhood places, collective efficacy and crime: A longitudinal perspective","['Renee Zahnow', 'Jonathan Corcoran', 'Anthony Kimpton', 'Rebecca Wickes']","Neighbourhood places like shops, cafes and parks support a variety of social interactions ranging from the ephemeral to the intimate. Repeated interactions at neighbourhood places over time lay the foundation for the development of social cohesion and collective efficacy. In this study, we examine the proposition that changes in the presence or arrangement of neighbourhood places can destabilise social cohesion and collective efficacy, which has implications for crime. Using spatially integrated crime, social survey and parcel-level land-use classification data, we estimate mixed effects panel models predicting changes in theft and nuisance crimes across 147 Australian neighbourhoods. The findings are consistent with neighbourhood social control and crime opportunity theories. Neighbourhood development – indicated by fewer vacant properties and fewer industrial and agricultural sites – is associated with higher collective efficacy and less crime over time. Conversely, introducing more restaurants, transit stations and cinemas is associated with higher theft and nuisance over time regardless of neighbourhood collective efficacy. We argue that the addition of socially conducive places can leave neighbourhoods vulnerable to crime until new patterns of sociability emerge and collective efficacy develops.",Article,1.0, Urban Studies,Jun 1,0,"

Fresh fish is the primary source of animal protein for many nations, and this is particularly true for equatorial nations in the Pacific. As fish stocks strain under climate change and increasing fishing pressure, their decline and collapse is becoming a common story. Predicted changes in fish populations indicate that equatorial nations will likely bear the brunt of nutritional insecurity, and this is particularly likely for Pacific nations where agricultural land is limited [1]. Given global threats to fisheries, and their importance to village diets in the Pacific, it is critical that fisheries resources are well managed to ensure food security for future generations. We interviewed 87 women across three villages in Marovo Lagoon, Western Province, Solomon Islands about their role in fisheries and fishery-related activities within their communities.. Of the women interviewed, 80.7% indicated that they do fish or harvest invertebrates. 84.5% of fisherwomen were primarily targeting finfish, not invertebrates, and most women (59.4%) indicated that they harvested seafood solely to feed their families. Results from this study contribute to a growing body of literature highlighting the high involvement of women in small-scale fisheries, and their contributions to household food security. This knowledge broadens our understanding of fishery resource utilization in the Solomon Islands, and provides data for strengthening food security through improved fisheries management.",Article,9.0, Marine Policy,,0,"

Moderators and mediators of outcomes of parents with substance use problems: Further evaluation of the Parents under Pressure Program,"['Sharon Dawe', 'Paul H Harnett', 'Matthew J Gullo[...]', 'Jane Barlow']","Background and aims Family-focused interventions can improve family functioning when parents have substance use problems. However, there has been little focus on potential predictors of change and analysis of mechanisms of change. This study aims to identify mediators and moderators of change in a pragmatic, multisite, randomised controlled trial of the Parents under Pressure (PuP) program, a family-focused intervention for parents with substance use and other problems, and treatment-as-usual (TAU). Design Secondary analysis of data: multilevel modelling was used to investigate moderators of treatment outcome; mediation was tested with cross-lagged models. Setting Community-based family support services in the United Kingdom. Participants Parents (N=100) attending community-based addiction services with children aged 2.5 years or younger. Measurements Predictors of the primary outcome, child abuse potential, were: baseline child age and gender, composite family risk score, parental substance use, and parental emotional dysregulation. Mediation was tested across three time-points with the observed variables parental emotion dysregulation and child abuse potential. Findings Increased child age (z = 2.14, CI95% 0.01, 0.33) at baseline was associated with greater reductions in child abuse potential for PuP program participants, compared with TAU. Poorer parental emotional regulation (z = 2.48, CI95% -2.76, -0.32) was associated with greater reductions in child abuse potential for all participants. Parental substance use (either recent use or primary substance of concern) did not alter any treatment effects on child abuse potential.

The Effect of Weather on Assault,"['Jonathan Corcoran', 'Renee Zahnow']","This paper examines the role of local weather conditions in explaining variations in assault, in sub-tropical Brisbane, Australia. It details the extent to which local variations in weather are important in shaping the necessary preconditions for assault to take place. Results suggest that higher daily temperatures are associated with an increased propensity for assault at the neighborhood level after controlling for seasonal effects. Assaults occur significantly less frequently in summer than in spring and there is a greater propensity for assaults to occur on weekends compared to weekdays. Neighborhood disadvantage, ethnic diversity, and the presence of risky facilities such bars, schools, or shops increased the propensity for assault above and beyond the effect of temperature. Findings are important in their capacity to isolate the effect of the prevailing local weather conditions whilst controlling for seasonal variations, land use, and the socio-economic and demographic context within which assaults took place.",Article,1.0, Environment and Behavior,May 21,0,"

Earliest known human burial in Africa,"['María Martinón-Torres', ""Francesco d'Errico"", 'Elena Santos[...]', 'Michael D. Petraglia']","The origin and evolution of hominin mortuary practices are topics of intense interest and debate1–3. Human burials dated to the Middle Stone Age (MSA) are exceedingly rare in Africa and unknown in East Africa1–6. Here we describe the partial skeleton of a roughly 2.5- to 3.0-year-old child dating to 78.3 ± 4.1 thousand years ago, which was recovered in the MSA layers of Panga ya Saidi (PYS), a cave site in the tropical upland coast of Kenya7,8. Recent excavations have revealed a pit feature containing a child in a flexed position. Geochemical, granulometric and micromorphological analyses of the burial pit content and encasing archaeological layers indicate that the pit was deliberately excavated. Taphonomical evidence, such as the strict articulation or good anatomical association of the skeletal elements and histological evidence of putrefaction, support the in-place decomposition of the fresh body. The presence of little or no displacement of the unstable joints during decomposition points to an interment in a filled space (grave earth), making the PYS finding the oldest known human burial in Africa. The morphological assessment of the partial skeleton is consistent with its assignment to Homo sapiens, although the preservation of some primitive features in the dentition supports increasing evidence for non-gradual assembly of modern traits during the emergence of our species. The PYS burial sheds light on how MSA populations interacted with the dead.",Article,1.0, Nature,May 8,1,"

The Land of the ‘Fair Go’? Mapping Income Inequality and Socioeconomic Segregation Across Melbourne Neighbourhoods,"['Michelle Sydes', 'Rebecca Wickes']","Despite enduring political rhetoric that promotes Australia as ‘the lucky country’ and ‘the land of the fair go’, recent decades have seen a noticeable increase in levels of income inequality. This growing economic divide has driven housing prices up and left lower-income families unable to access the housing market in inner-city locations. In contrast to other countries, Australia’s socioeconomic segregation does not overlap with ethnic segregation. Australia’s highly regulated immigration program has resulted in a relatively well-educated and employable foreign-born population who largely reside in middle-income neighbourhoods. These particularities make Australia an interesting context to explore patterns of socioeconomic segregation over time. In this chapter, we will utilise both traditional measures of segregation (such as the dissimilarity index) as well more spatialised measures (such as location quotients and Local Morans I ) to assess socioeconomic segregation at the local level. Drawing on four waves of census data (2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016), we explore how socioeconomic segregation has changed over time across nearly 500 neighbourhoods in Melbourne. We further examine the degree to which socioeconomic segregation aligns with ethnic segregation patterns and levels in this city. We find patterns of socioeconomic segregation remain relatively unchanging over time in Melbourne. Additionally, our findings highlight important differences in patterns and levels of socioeconomic and ethnic segregation in the Australian context.",Chapter,,,May 2,1,"

"Agri-food scholarship: Past, present and future contributions to Australasian rural sociology","['Kiah Smith', 'Geoffrey Lawrence']","The future of food and agriculture in Australasia will be defined by multiple social, economic, political and environmental tensions – with climate change and social inequalities playing a central role in the re-imagining of food systems in crisis. This article argues that rural sociology will continue to be well-served by the sociological research into the farming and food industries undertaken by antipodean scholars – especially those from Australia and New Zealand where agri-food scholarship has flourished. Analyses of the future dynamics of rural social/economic change, natural resource management (including land, water and minerals), new relations of work, labour and identity, emerging agricultural technologies, Indigenous and post-colonial politics, and food system governance will benefit from agri-food studies’ insights into agrarian transformation and governance, social and environmental sustainability, health and wellbeing, and the growth of resistance and alternatives.",Article,1.0, Journal of Sociology,May 2,0,"

Financialization for Development? Asset Making on Indigenous Land in Remote Northern Australia,"['Zannie Langford', 'Geoffrey Lawrence', 'Kiah Smith']","Indigenous Australian landowners are increasingly seeking to develop agricultural production on their lands to improve the welfare and economic opportunities of their communities. This can require substantial capital input and, in the absence of enough government funding, Indigenous groups are turning to private investors. Development literature has explored private sector‐led and ‘financialized’ approaches to development at a macro level as something that is done to communities; however, less research has examined how remote communities themselves seek to develop their natural assets through partnerships with businesses and with global finance. This article examines the work being done to prepare land for external investment. It provides an example of emergent assetization processes being undertaken outside the financial sector, driven by social outcomes seemingly beyond the domain of shareholder value. Paradoxically, individuals engaged in these asset‐making processes may oppose the withdrawal of direct funding for community development associated with a financialization of development, yet they are left with few options but to further these efforts by seeking private finance themselves — facilitating financialization for development. This interaction of structural effects and local agency complicates narratives of financialization as they are commonly presented and has important implications for Indigenous economic development in Northern Australia.",Article,1.0, Development and Change,,0,"

Stochastic models support rapid peopling of Late Pleistocene Sahul,"['Corey J. A. Bradshaw', 'Kasih Norman', 'Sean Ulm[...]', 'Frédérik Saltré']","The peopling of Sahul (the combined continent of Australia and New Guinea) represents the earliest continental migration and settlement event of solely anatomically modern humans, but its patterns and ecological drivers remain largely conceptual in the current literature. We present an advanced stochastic-ecological model to test the relative support for scenarios describing where and when the first humans entered Sahul, and their most probable routes of early settlement. The model supports a dominant entry via the northwest Sahul Shelf first, potentially followed by a second entry through New Guinea, with initial entry most consistent with 50,000 or 75,000 years ago based on comparison with bias-corrected archaeological map layers. The model’s emergent properties predict that peopling of the entire continent occurred rapidly across all ecological environments within 156–208 human generations (4368–5599 years) and at a plausible rate of 0.71–0.92 km year−1. More broadly, our methods and approaches can readily inform other global migration debates, with results supporting an exit of anatomically modern humans from Africa 63,000–90,000 years ago, and the peopling of Eurasia in as little as 12,000–15,000 years via inland routes.",Article,1.0, Nature Communications,May 1,1,"

Challenges in combatting female genital mutilation: narratives of black Sub-Saharan African (BSSA) women in the English west Midlands region,"['Mathew Nyashanu', 'Maureen Mguni']","Purpose It is believed that more than 120 million women have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM) and more than 2 million young girls are at risk of undergoing FGM. FGM is practiced in different parts of the world. With globalisation and the increased movement of people across the globe, FGM is now a global problem. While ending FGM remains a priority, the approaches and strategies being used have generated contested views across the social divide. The purpose of this study is to explore the challenges in combatting FGM as experienced by Black Sub-Saharan African (BSSA) women in Diaspora. Design/methodology/approach This qualitative study used a phenomenological approach. Narratives were collected from 40 BSSA women from 20 Sub-Saharan African countries living in the English West Midlands region. A thematic approach underpinned by the four phases of data analysis in the Silences Framework were used to analyse the data. Findings The research study found that stigmatisation of survivors, utilisation of graphic images in FGM awareness, exclusion of practising communities’ gatekeepers in FGM interventions, conflation of religion and FGM practice and obsession with securing a conviction were obstacles in combating FGM. Diaspora community-driven studies exploring FGM and contested notions in addressing it from women perspectives are scarce. Originality/value This study pulls together the experiences of BSSA women and their perspectives on contested notions in combating FGM in the UK. The debate asserts the growing need to consider gender sensitive radical interventions, which involves educating perpetrators and gatekeepers among FGM practising communities.",Article,1.0, International Journal of Human Rights in Healthcare,5d ago,0,"

Beyond Disciplines: Spoken Word as Participatory Arts-based Research,['Helen Johnson'],"For many, the arts and sciences stand at opposite ends of an unbridgeable divide: the sciences, rigid, objective, systematic and authoritative; the arts, fluid, subjective, dynamic and capricious. Yet, there is a long history of productive dialogue and interconnection between these fields. Arts-based research represents a particularly fertile form of arts/science interaction. This paper interweaves poetry, theoretical discussion and empirical research to make the case for spoken word poetry as an arts-based method of inquiry that can provide a radically different way of doing, being and collaborating in and through research. With reference to the innovative method of ‘collaborative poetics’ and to the work of youth slam/spoken word educators, I argue that social scientists and spoken word practitioners can learn much from one another’s tools, techniques and ways of thinking, creating new forms of knowledge, redefining the audience/author relationship, and facilitating a ‘critical resilience’ which enables both individual fortitude in the face of adversity and a means through which to challenge the conditions that give rise to this adversity. The paper thus considers how spoken word as participatory poetic inquiry enables participants, researchers and poets to address the critical complexities and challenges of contemporary life.",Article,1.0, International Review of Qualitative Research,Dec 13,0,"

"There’s An App For That: Context, Assumptions, Possibilities And Potential Pitfalls In The Use Of Digital Technologies To Address Refugee Mental Health","['Ruth Goodman', 'Linda Kirsten Tip', 'Kate Cavanagh']","The number of refugees is increasing (UNHCR, 2019). The experiences of refugees are linked to impaired mental health yet, this population faces barriers to accessing mental health support (Shannon et al., 2016). Digital mental health interventions are increasingly recognised as an avenue for overcoming these barriers (WHO, 2017). The present paper begins by introducing the area of digital approaches to mental health and developments in this area targeted at refugee populations specifically. We then take a step back to look at the wider picture of refugee mental health and technology. Drawing on Toyama’s Law of Amplification (2011; 2015) - that successful technical interventions amplify the intent and the capacity of the people involved - we discuss the importance of context, exploring the assumptions, possibilities and potential pitfalls in the use of digital technologies for addressing refugee mental health. We conclude that by collaborating with refugee populations, placing them at the centre of the design process for digital mental health interventions, we stand the greatest chance of creating the most useful tools.",Article,0.0, Journal of Refugee Studies,Nov 30,0,"

We analyse quantitative data on language proficiency four or more years after resettlement to identify the key characteristics of those who are most likely to have low language proficiency and to be at risk of long-term dependency and exclusion. Qualitative interviews on experiences of language learning suggest that English-language policy and provision serve to exacerbate and compound the risk of social exclusion, rather than ameliorate the risk. Our findings draw attention to the lack of recognition and understanding of the diversity of resettled refugees and their differential capacities, needs and opportunities for learning. They also highlight the conflict between the policy goal of rapid entry into the labour market and the goal of language learning. These findings have clear implications for integration strategies and policy.",Article,9.0, Journal of Refugee Studies,,0,"

Mohajir militancy in Pakistan: Violence and transformation in the Karachi conflict,['Nichola Khan'],"Synthesizing political, anthropological and psychological perspectives, this book addresses the everyday causes and appeal of long-term involvement in extreme political violence in urban Pakistan. Taking Pakistan's ethno nationalist Mohajir party, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) as a case study, it explores how certain men from the ethnic community of Mohajirs are recruited to the roles and statuses of political killers, and sustain violence as a primary social identity and lifestyle over a period of some years. By drawing on detailed fieldwork in areas involved in the Karachi conflict, the author contributes to understandings of violence, tracing the development of violent aspects of Mohajir nationalism via an exploration of political and cultural contexts of Pakistan's history, and highlighting the repetitive homology of the conflict with the earlier violence of Partition. Through a local comparison of ethnic and religious militancy she also updates the current situation of social and cultural change in Karachi, which is dominantly framed in terms of Islamist radicalization and modernization. In her examination, governance and civil society issues are integrated with the political and psychological dimensions of mobilization processes and violence at micro-, meso- and macro- levels. This book injects a critical and innovative voice into the ongoing debates about the nature and meaning of radicalization and violence, as well as the specific implications it has for similar, contemporary conflicts in Pakistan and the developing world.",Article,,,Oct 25,0,"

Three-sided football: DIY football and social transformationalism,['Benjin Pollock'],"Devised as an illustrative example of ‘triolectics’, Danish artist and philosopher Asger Jorn first conceived of three-sided football (3SF) in 1962 as a way to radically transform the world. However, 3SF remained a purely abstracted philosophical concept until 1994 when a group of anarchists, architects and artists decided to play the game for the first time. Since these early experiments, 3SF has been played and developed across the globe, from anti-racist football festivals in Germany, contemporary art installations in France, through to youth outreach programs in Colombia. Far beyond its emergent context, the game continues to resonate for a myriad of social actors in search of bottom-up ways to enact transformational change in contemporary culture. Drawing from forty-four semi-structured interviews with players, coaches, curators and activists, this paper provides the first ethnography into 3SF and privileges much needed perspectives into how ‘DIY Football’ initiatives are actively redefining individual and collective relationships to sport and politics in informal volunteer settings. Utilising the work of Bourdieu as a useful conceptual heuristic, it details how participants reflect upon, and negotiate, the challenges of reaching beyond the ‘doxic logics’ of binary competitive team sport. Moreover, how the democratic ‘desportised’ spaces of 3SF transcend quotidian sporting contexts and offer distinct forms of political renewal, social inclusion and practical education. This study further contends that the horizontalist non-hierarchical nature of the game develops critical consciousness and community leadership for those involved in the play.",Article,1.0, Sport Education and Society,Oct 23,0,"

CO-CONSTRUCTED TRANSNATIONAL LEARNING IN POSTGRADUATE RESEARCH SUPERVISION: EXPLORING ISSUES OF POWER AND TRUST,"['Rachel Martin', 'Mark Price']","This paper considers the challenges and affordances relating to shifts in supervisory encounters arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, within a transnational postgraduate student-tutor supervisory relationship. It explores particularly the co-constructional nature of transnational learning, reflecting on issues of power and trust, from masters to doctoral research in education practice. Rachel and Mark worked together in a student-supervisor relationship, firstly on the MA Education and then on the Doctorate in Education (EdD) programmes, jointly offered by the Mauritius Institute of Education and the University of Brighton, UK. Rachel's research considers narrative and autoethnographic inquiry into educational professionalism, agency and becoming and parallels Mark's own research interest and experience. Our reflections were developed through a series of email exchanges and online discussions, theorised through meta-reflection and analysis. Informed by postcolonial perspectives, the paper notes that the complexity and inequalities of power distribution in such a transnational supervisory relationship are likely to be compounded through shifts to online only encounters.

Methodologically materialising hate: Incorporating participatory design methods within qualitative research on crime and victimisation,"['Cally Gatehouse', 'James Pickles']","The use of ‘design’ within qualitative research on crime and victimisation, and within the social disciplines more generally, has seen very little commentary or discussion. ‘Design’ is referred to throughout as the professional and scholarly practice rather than the ‘research design’, that is, the practical plan for the methods used to generate data. Design in this former sense has historically drawn on both arts and engineering to give form to garments, products and visual communication. This article presents a case study, followed by a reflective discussion, of a research project in which research through design methods were used to construct two focus groups involving lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people and police liaison officers as part of a hate crime project. Participants were asked to design reporting devices that would respond to hateful behaviour. Through the design process, participants materialised their own experiences of hate and embodied emotional responses to those experiences. The authors argue that there are methodological, ideological and practical benefits for incorporating research through design methods within qualitative research on crime and victimisation. Design offers a way of critically and creatively reimagining how research methods are understood and utilised, challenging how criminological methodologies traditionally operate.",Article,1.0, Methodological Innovations Online,Oct 8,1,"

Whilst a pilot for future research, the purpose of this Dissertation is to bring forward the mounting evidence in favour of full legalisation of psychoactive substances. Full legalisation can seem extreme in many disciplines but from a harm reductionist perspective, as well as a critical criminological one, it is the most progressive. Done with the right guidance, care and educated expert input we can understand everyone's subjective reasons for medicating; be it self-medicating in the form of recreational use or access to indispensable medicines for medicinal use.

‘There Is no Home Office Definition of Knife Crime’,"['Elaine Williams', 'Peter Squires']","Knife violence has become a topic of great urgency in British society, politics and culture. Hardly a day goes by without further news of brutal stabbings and tragic violence. Yet despite the current preoccupation with ‘knife crime’, stretching back some two decades, a peak in knife violence around 2007, and a resurgence in the problem ten years later, with relatively few exceptions, there has been surprisingly little detailed criminological attention given to it. Although the problem is treated as a matter of fact, a largely self-explanatory label, many commentators have repeatedly acknowledged the difficulty in establishing a consistent, workable and evidence-based definition of ‘knife crime’. What we call ‘knife crime’ consists of a range of different offences and, as our timeline shows, a ‘knife enabled’ code first entered police crime recording in 2001 but it was only in 2011 that year on year comparable knife crime data became available. Subsequently, the inclusion of ‘aggravated’ knife possession offences in the knife crime figures (themselves subject to police activity rates), has further complicated attempts to clarify ‘knife crime’ trends. Yet fears and concerns about knife crime have always been driven by more than just the numbers, such as: the state of youth, urban safety, ‘dangerous others’, even though more than half of contemporary knife violence is inflicted by adults and much of it occurs in more ‘domestic’ contexts. In this chapter we examine both the scale and nature of contemporary knife-enabled violence, and ask to what extent ‘knife crime’ can be defined and understood as a distinct category of offending. In recognising the contradictions and challenges here we begin to outline a framework for a new understanding of knife crime, i

The ‘Knife Crime Industry’: Knife Fetish and the Commodification of Violence Prevention,"['Elaine Williams', 'Peter Squires']","Knife crime became a priority issue in criminal justice practice and youth policy from 2009 onwards and directed funding supported an increasing amount of targeted knife crime prevention work and organisations dedicated to knife crime intervention. Since then, there has been a great deal of innovation in the sector and it is now possible to find companies providing anti-knife crime posters, t-shirts, stickers, magnets, educational packs, assemblies, teaching resources, knife deposit boxes and much more. Sometimes these are sponsored or associated with particularly fashionable market brands, celebrities or sports stars. The scale of services and products marketed through this crime label accumulate to what we define, following critiques developed around ‘gang interventions’ as a ‘knife crime industry’, with a cross-sector network of influential professionals who benefit from an individualistic and fetishised commodification of the label. Analysing online discourse within this industry, this chapter considers how the meaning of knife crime is constituted and constitutive of this market and profoundly self-fulfilling.

"A Prelude to ‘Knife Crime’: Gangs, Weapons and the ‘Macpherson Effect’","['Elaine Williams', 'Peter Squires']","Drawing upon the critical conjunctural analysis in Policing the Crisis (Hall et al., Policing the crisis: Mugging, the state, and law and order, Macmillan, 1978) this chapter considers the context in which a distinct mobilisation towards ‘knife crime’ (following ‘mugging’ as the new ‘black crime’) occurred, before the label was publicly defined. Contextualising this moment within the politics of a New Labour government from 1997, we consider how the contradictions of an authoritarian social democracy re-articulated the law and order society through a focus on ‘youth crime’ and anti-social behaviour. The publication of the Macpherson report and the official recognition of institutional racism within the Metropolitan Police is a significant cultural moment—the ‘Macpherson effect’—that characterises this period. Existing racialised discourses of ‘gun culture’ and ‘gang culture’ already provided justifications for robust and proactive policing strategies at the turn of the twenty-first century, but the post-Macpherson mobilisation towards ‘knife crime’ (anticipated in the 1997 Knives Act) is a particular development that is often overlooked. The introduction of the ‘knife enabled’ crime recording feature code in 2001 fundamentally changed the way crimes were categorised and reported, culminating in the problematic public definition of ‘knife crime’ as we understand it today. The interaction of events that lead to this moment will be analysed here to establish, again drawing upon Policing the Crisis, a pre-history of the label and its constitution.",Chapter,,,,0,"

A Joined-Up Approach to Sustainable Violence Prevention?,"['Elaine Williams', 'Peter Squires']","With ‘knife crime’ returning to the headlines from 2015 onwards the limitations of existing enforcement-led interventions of recent years became profoundly exposed. More than this, the impact of proactive policing upon youth and communities, especially BAME communities, with periodic roll-outs of stop and search policy, appeared to further alienate many, diminishing trust and confidence, and convincing many young people that knife carrying could offer a degree of protection. In response, especially following the much heralded success of the Strathclyde Community Initiative to Reduce Violence (CIRV) and Boston’s successful gang strategy ‘Operation Ceasefire’ in the USA, a range of international commentators have begun urging the adoption of more ‘joined up’ ‘public health’ approaches to violence. Such strategies have combined with recent WHO advocacy favouring public health, ecological or evidence-led and ‘epidemiological’, models of violence prevention, seeking to rebalance the strategies aimed at addressing knife-involved violence. But a public health violence strategy involves much more than just giving doctors and clinicians the lead, and in the chapter we raise some of the issues. Nevertheless the optimism and popularity of ‘public health’ in violence reduction has entailed a significant shift in knife crime discourse, although it has not been plain sailing—despite much talk, there is little apparent agreement on what a sustainable violence reduction strategy might actually look like as well as questions about the willingness of government—especially in austerity—to adequately fund it. The issue of mandatory A&E reporting of weapon assault injuries to the police has also divided opinion.",Chapter,,,Oct 2,0,"

A Moral Panic: The ‘War on Knife Crime’,"['Elaine Williams', 'Peter Squires']","The moral panic concerning young people and knives reached a peak in 2007 and 2008 as news media reported a spike in child knife homicides. The culmination of public pressure and politicisation set the scene for a significant expansion of police powers and related enforcement activity, a renewed commitment to stop and search, a major roll-out of Tasers to front-line police, new legislation, new offences, enhanced sentencing, and new criminal orders. The persistent criminalisation and ‘othering’ of Black youth during this moment very much mirrors the response to ‘mugging’ in the 1970s; a politics of law and order used to re-establish political authority in the midst of economic crisis. This chapter considers how the uncertainties following the global banking crisis in the 2000s, and the contrived politics of austerity which followed, established the foundations for a more authoritarian and disciplinary public policy regime. Here we situate the political focus on ‘knife crime’ in this moment as one amongst a number of important political shifts during a temporary rupture in the maintenance of political authority. This chapter follows the ‘knife crime’ chronology and narrative up to the present, including its return to the headlines around 2015, finally drawing attention to the interaction between the extension of police powers and the political uncertainty during and after Britain’s Brexit referendum and the Covid ‘lockdowns’ which followed.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Peer support groups for parent-carers of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: the importance of solidarity as care,"['Orly Klein', 'Carl Walker', 'Kim Aumann[...]', 'Jenny Terry']","Parent-carers of children with complex needs often lead lives impacted by challenging constellations of disadvantage and can become enmeshed in complex and contradictory tapestries of care structures and relations. Against a backdrop of financial austerity and under-resourced or exclusionary service practices, peer support groups may become increasingly important and confer valuable benefits not available elsewhere. This article focuses on one such group developed for parent-carers of children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and reports on semi-structured interviews with 13 parent-carers. Drawing upon Pols’ empirical ethics of care, we nuance and detail the care that emerged in these settings, highlighting the material and relational practices that developed. We conclude that peer support groups can offer new and vital possibilities, re-situating participants from individualised positions of burden, isolation and social exclusion to confident, positive, active connectedness, by means of an affective and effective relational process we call ‘solidarity-as-care’.",Article,9.0, Disability & Society,Sep 13,0,"

Building Spaces for Controversial Public Engagement – Exploring and Challenging Democratic Deficits in NHS Marketization,"['Carl Walker', 'Kepa Artaraz', 'Mary Darking[...]', 'Anna Zoli']","The Brighton Citizen's Health Services Survey (BCHSS) was developed to explore and potentially challenge how knowledge is used and by whom in the production of local health commissioning institutions and relations. Through the creation of an ‘animating set of questions’, it sought to open up spaces through which to make visible some of the ways of knowing and valuing the NHS and health services that had been minimised through the commensuration practices of post-2012 public engagement. In this way there was a clear agenda to facilitate a form of knowledge democratisation which opened up and validated different 'health publics’, in order to explore and broaden participative engagement opportunities. The paper provides an account of the project. It considers the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of this example of ‘evidence-based activism’, reflects on the impact of the project on local commissioning and considers the range of controversies that arose as a result of the work. It explores the way that research straddling the boundary between academic inquiry and political activism speaks to the many issues that are prevalent in the changing HE sector as well as NHS privatisation, health commissioning and public sector cuts.",Article,8.0, Journal of Social and Political Psychology,,0,"

A death in the family: Citizens' experiences of changing healthcare commissioning practices in South East England,"['Rebecca Graber', 'Anna Zoli', 'Carl Walker', 'Kepa Artaraz']","The Brighton Citizens Health Services Survey was an academic activism project to identify and understand citizens' perceptions of and responses to healthcare commissioning practices. Significant legislated changes to the National Health System (NHS) across England have increased marketisation in healthcare provision, yet little research has explored the psychological dimensions of this shifting context and its community impact. Taking a community psychological perspective to social policy, we aimed to understand lay citizens' lived experience of changes in healthcare commissioning and provision. Thematic analysis of 379 free‐text responses yielded two thematic clusters. Cluster 1 describes the lived experience of citizens considering reforms to the NHS, depicting grief, mortality and fear in uncertainty. Cluster 2 explores where these affective responses may derive from by detailing conceptualisations of the NHS in the lived experience, describing how the NHS was experienced as a complex and embodied phenomenological object. Findings suggest people relate affectively to local commissioning practices, feeling a sense of loss when facing the degradation of ‘their’ NHS. We argue that an affective relational perspective centres important questions of silencing, voice‐giving, meaningful engagement and ways of knowing that in turn impact the landscape of community health.",Article,0.0, Journal of Community & Applied Social Psychology,,0,"

Communicating Vegan Utopias: The Counterfactual Construction of Human-animal Futures,['Matthew Adams'],"Industrialized animal agriculture reveals human-animal relations defined by routinized, institutionalized violence on a staggering scale. Despite greater public recognition of these issues, consumption of meat and other products from industrially processed animals continues to rise globally. This article responds to an ongoing need to consider unexplored sites in research addressing challenges to “meat culture” and the promotion of alternatives. To this end, it examines the film Carnage, about a future vegan utopia, as a distinctive artistic intervention. It is analyzed as a unique example of the construction of counterfactual futures – the practice of imagining the potential impact of hypothetical events on future scenarios. It is claimed that Carnage reflects potential advances in effective animal advocacy, and further innovation in artistic, cultural and methodological interventions that can enliven campaigning repertoires of rhetorical strategies, discursive and narrative frames.",Article,1.0, Environmental Communication A Journal of Nature and Culture,Aug 27,0,"

Deliberation on Childhood Vaccination in Canada: Public Input on Ethical Trade-Offs in Vaccination Policy,"[""Kieran C O'Doherty"", 'Sara E Crann', 'Lucie Marisa Bucci[...]', 'Don Willison']","Background Policy decisions about childhood vaccination require consideration of multiple, sometimes conflicting, public health and ethical imperatives. Examples of these decisions are whether vaccination should be mandatory and, if so, whether to allow for non-medical exemptions. In this article we argue that these policy decisions go beyond typical public health mandates and therefore require democratic input. Methods We report on the design, implementation, and results of a deliberative public forum convened over four days in Ontario, Canada, on the topic of childhood vaccination. Results 25 participants completed all four days of deliberation and collectively developed 20 policy recommendations on issues relating to mandatory vaccinations and exemptions, communication about vaccines and vaccination, and AEFI (adverse events following immunization) compensation and reporting. Notable recommendations include unanimous support for mandatory childhood vaccination in Ontario, the need for broad educational communication about vaccination, and the development of a no-fault compensation scheme for AEFIs. There was persistent disagreement among deliberants about the form of exemptions from vaccination (conscience, religious beliefs) that should be permissible, as well as appropriate consequences if parents do not vaccinate their children. Conclusions We conclude that conducting deliberative democratic processes on topics that are polarizing and controversial is viable and should be further developed and implemented to support democratically legitimate and trustworthy policy about childhood vaccination.",Article,1.0, AJOB Empirical Bioethics,Aug 12,1,"

Children’s sleepiness facilitates the effect of vicarious learning on the development of fear,"['Gemma Reynolds', 'Donna Leigh Ewing']","A substantial body of research demonstrates the importance of sleep for emotional processing and learning as well as the association between sleep problems and heightened anxiety. However, there is currently no research exploring the impact of sleepiness on vicariously learned fear responses. Experiment 1 (N = 38) first demonstrated no effect of trait or state sleepiness on children’s (7–11 years of age) subjective ratings of fear. Experiment 2 (N = 42) and Experiment 3 (N = 46) used an established vicarious learning paradigm to demonstrate that trait sleepiness facilitated vicariously acquired avoidance preferences for animals paired with fearful faces (fear-paired animals), whereas state sleepiness facilitated children’s fear cognitions and attentional bias toward fear-paired animals. This study is the first to demonstrate the role of state and trait sleepiness in moderating vicarious fear learning in children.",Article,1.0, Journal of Experimental Child Psychology,Aug 1,0,"

Gender: In World Perspective 4 th Edition by Raewyn Connell – Book Review by James Pickles,['James Pickles'],"The fourth edition of Gender: In World Perspective is a concise volume in the Short Introductions’ series, and one that many in the field of gender studies will find compliments their library shelf. Comprised of eight chapters, this introductory text explores the historic development and contemporary thinking relating to gender and its relational components in different contexts across the globe. Whilst modelling the same layout as the third edition, this fourth edition provides new case studies to demonstrate everyday manifestations of gender and revises the analytical treatment of politics, environmental issues, and embodiment to bring all chapters up to date. This edition renews its efforts to be as diverse as possible, drawing on often overlooked gender research and theory from outside of Western Europe, to places such as Finland, Chile, Australia, South Africa, Indonesia, and Japan. Although touting itself as an introduction to academic perspectives on gender, this book is very comprehensive in its scope and covers the social, economic, political, relational, and global dimensions of gender theories. Due to the level of comprehension over such a short book it may be convoluted for lay audiences or those who are new to philosophies and social theories of gender. Indeed, this is no ‘easy-read’ overview of gender scholarship. Personally, I would recommend this to undergraduate students in their final years of university or postgraduate students who wish to specialise in gender research over those who are new to gender theory.

They do this by creatively writing lived experiences, sharing these with each other, holding and feeling these lived encounters over time then creatively responding back with gifted crafted words and imagery. Reflection on these gifts and how they bring new insight to lived experiences create collated multi-vocal biographies. Through their collective arts-based poetic and visual inquiry, they see reflections and diffractions in each other’s lived stories that metaphorically provoke understandings of the pain swept into the unforgiving corners of cold, unloving universities.

Exploring the Lived Experience of People with Dementia Through Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis,['Helen Johnson'],"Dementia is arguably one of the biggest challenges facing society today, impacting millions of people worldwide. Nonetheless, there is only a relatively small body of research exploring what it is like to live with dementia from the perspectives of people who have this condition. This is partly because of the (implicit or explicit) belief that people with dementia lack insight into their condition and cannot talk about their experiences clearly. In this article, I argue that such beliefs are typically both erroneous and unhelpful, and that there is great value in seeking to illuminate the lived experiences of people with dementia. I present an interpretative phenomenological analysis of data from semi-structured interviews with six participants who had moderate dementia. I elicit five themes from this analytic process, and discuss the three most prominent here: Awareness and understanding of dementia, clarity and confusion, and social support and relationships. I mobilise these themes to narrate the lived experiences of people with dementia, demonstrating their awareness both of the difficulties presented by dementia and of the negative perceptions of others.",Article,6.0, Qualitative Report,,0,"

Professional 'imperialism' and resistance: Social Work in the Filippines,"['Jem Price', 'Kepa Artaraz']","The sociology of professions has traditionally attempted to increase our understanding of categorisations of different occupations by reference to taxonomic hierarchies, as well as the identification and exploration of characteristics that warrant 'professional status'. In may cases, this explorations take the forms of historical accounts of professional activity. Rarely, however, has the literature on professions explored processes of professionalization in devoliping, post-colonial contexts. This article contributes to this body of literature in the study of professions in a number of ways. Firstly, it 'maps' the growth of social work in the Filippines, placing this account within a broader discussions of social work as an internationality activity (Harrison & Melville, 2010; Lyons, 2006) and identifying some of the key forms and features of social work in the Filippines. Consideration is given to the degree of professionalisation of social work within the country by exploring professional organisation, regulation and education. In doing this, the article offers a critical overview of the nature and preoccupations of social work in the Filippines and celebrates the invaluable contributions it makes to the country and its people. The article argue that the forms social work takes and the settings in wich it happens reflect both contemporay societal and environmental factors as well as the global development of social work. In this sense, the article considers the impact of Roman Catholicism as well as the orientation of social work in relation to some enduring tensions and debates around the profession's purpose and potential. Key to the professional forms that social work takes in the Filippines is the contribution of 'indigenous' social work know

Research suggests that the emotional harms of ‘hate’ can indirectly victimise those with a shared identity as the primary victim, through emotional contagion. However, little research has been carried out on those who support victims of hate. I theorise that vicarious victimisation may occur where an individual, who shares the primary victim’s identity, takes on their experiences through a therapeutic relationship as a negative consequence of the emotional labour performed.",Article,1.0, Sociological Research Online,Jun 2,1,"

Notes from a field: A qualitative exploration of human-animal relations in a volunteer shepherding project,"['Matthew Adams', 'James Ormrod', 'Sarah Smith']","There is a burgeoning interest in human–animal relations across the social sciences and humanities, accompanied by an acceptance that nonhuman animals are active participants in countless social relations, worthy of serious and considered empirical exploration.

Digital Approaches to Music-Making for People With Dementia in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Current Practice and Recommendations,"['Becky Dowson', 'Rebecca Atkinson', 'Julie Barnes[...]', 'Justine Schneider']","Before COVID-19, dementia singing groups and choirs flourished, providing activity, cognitive stimulation, and social support for thousands of people with dementia in the UK. Interactive music provides one of the most effective psychosocial interventions for people with dementia; it can allay agitation and promote wellbeing. Since COVID-19 has halted the delivery of in-person musical activities, it is important for the welfare of people with dementia and their carers to investigate what alternatives to live music making exist, how these alternatives are delivered and how their accessibility can be expanded. This community case study examines recent practice in online music-making in response to COVID-19 restrictions for people with dementia and their supporters, focusing on a UK context. It documents current opportunities for digital music making, and assesses the barriers and facilitators to their delivery and accessibility. Online searches of video streaming sites and social media documented what music activities were available. Expert practitioners and providers collaborated on this study and supplied input about the sessions they had been delivering, the technological challenges and solutions they had found, and the responses of the participants. Recommendations for best practice were developed and refined in consultation with these collaborators. Over 50 examples of online music activities were identified. In addition to the challenges of digital inclusion and accessibility for some older people, delivering live music online has unique challenges due to audio latency and sound quality.

Developing New Routes across North Europe: Walking in the Baltic States and England,"['John Eade', 'Tiina Sepp']","A paper written with Tiina Sepp which examines the revival of pilgrimage routes in northern Europe through a comparison between the Baltic States and England. The authors largely draw on ethnographic data based on interviews with walkers in Estonia and participant observation of one way walks in England organised by the British Pilgrimage Trust. The contemporary proliferation of pilgrimage routes across northern Europe is remarkable given the destruction of shrines during the Protestant Reformation and the concomitant rapid decline in those walking to those shrines, except in Ireland and in one of Baltic States studied here, Lithuania. While pilgrimage revived as a religious practice in England during the early twentieth century , contemporary pilgrimage has become more inclusive, being bound up with the increasing popularity of walking as a leisure activity in Europe after the Second World War, the increasing degree of individual choice, the reinterpretation of pilgrimage as a ""spiritual"" journey and increasing interest in heritage. In both the Baltic States and England the camino to Santiago de Compostela serves as an influential model but national factors (political, cultural and social) are also important.",Preprint,,,20h ago,0,"

Poles Apart? EU Enlargement and the Labour Market Outcomes of Immigrants in the UK,"['Stephen Drinkwater', 'John Eade', 'Michal Garapich']","The UK was one of only three countries to allow migrants from accession countries to enter their labour markets more or less without restriction following EU enlargement in May 2004. Therefore, it is important to establish the characteristics and labour market performance of migrants from these countries who have subsequently entered the UK. We principally analyse Labour Force Survey data to compare the labour market outcomes of recent migrants from Poland and other accession countries to those of earlier migrant cohorts from these countries as well as to those of other recent migrants to the UK. We find that the majority of post-enlargement migrants from accession countries have found employment in low paying jobs, despite some (especially Poles) having relatively high levels of education. It follows that recent Polish migrants typically have lower returns to their education than other recent arrivals. Migrants from the new entrants who arrived immediately prior to enlargement possess similar characteristics and labour market outcomes, apart from having a higher propensity to be self-employed. These results are discussed in the context of policy changes, migration strategies, assimilation effects and possible impacts on the sending countries.",Article,6.0, SSRN Electronic Journal,Nov 20,1,"

A protocol for the management of grapevine rootstock mother vines to reduce latent infections by grapevine trunk pathogens in cuttings,"['Helen Waite', 'Regina Billones-Baaijens', 'Josep Armengol[...]', 'Richard Smart']","A protocol is offered as a guideline for managers of rootstock mother grapevines, and as a potential research framework for to reduce infections by Grapevine Trunk Disease (GTD) pathogens in rootstock mother vines and cuttings. Latent infections by GTD pathogens in rootstock cuttings are a major source of the pathogens in grafted nursery vines and subsequently in new vineyards. The many pruning cuts made at the crowns of mother vines predispose them to infection which is transmitted to the new shoots via the xylem. Direct penetration by epiphytic inoculum on the bark of the shoots/canes can also occur. Mother vines with unprotected pruning wounds are typically heavily infected, particularly if they are not trellised. Availability of pruning wound treatments is limited in many countries. The spread of GTD pathogen inoculum can be reduced by avoiding sprinkler and flood irrigation, by trellising mother vines so that canopies are off the soil, and by spraying fungicides or painting wounds immediately after canes are harvested. Frequent trunk renewal aids in reducing inoculum. Cuts should be made to retain long internodes on the mother vines, cuttings should not contact the soil and pruning debris should be promptly destroyed. Cutting implements should be disinfested regularly and cuttings should be dipped in a registered fungicide or sterilant. Soaking cuttings increases fungal populations in the basal wounds and softens the bark, favouring penetration by pathogen inoculum. Dormant bench grafting in nurseries produces more GTD-symptomatic vines than field chip budding, so improved management for rootstock mother vines is more important where dormant cuttings are bench grafted.

Fighting the Resource Curse: The Rights of Citizens Over Natural Resources,"['Jeremie Gilbert', 'Leif Wenar']","Respect for the rights of peoples over natural resources is crucial for the flourishing of communities and states. This article confirms that international law ascribes robust resource rights both to indigenous peoples and to citizens of independent states. These resource rights include indigenous peoples’ right to free, prior, and informed consent and citizens’ rights that resource revenues are never used corruptly but are used first to secure their means of subsistence. Resource rights are human rights, respect for which requires substantial reforms in the practices of corporations and investors as well as in the laws of resource-importing and resource-exporting states.",Article,,,Jul 21,0,"

"Burden, Risk Factors and Outcomes Associated with Gestational Diabetes in A Population-Based Cohort of Pregnant Women from North India","['Stuti Bahl', 'Neeta Dhabhai', 'Sunita Taneja[...]', 'Ranadip Chowdhury']","Background: The burden of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) appears to be increasing in India and may be related to the double burden of malnutrition. The population-based incidence and risk factors of GDM, particularly in lower socio-economic populations, are not known. We conducted analyses on data from a population-based cohort of pregnant women in South Delhi, India, to determine the incidence of GDM, its risk factors and association with adverse pregnancy outcomes (stillbirth, preterm birth, large for gestational age babies) and need for caesarean section. Methods: We analyzed data from the intervention group of the Women and Infants Integrated Interventions for Growth Study (WINGS), an individually randomized factorial design trial. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at the time of confirmation of pregnancy, and for those who had a normal test (≤140 mg), it was repeated at 24-28 and at 34-36 weeks. Logistic regression was performed to ascertain risk factors associated with GDM. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated to find association between GDM and adverse pregnancy outcomes and need for caesarean section. Results: 19.2% (95% CI: 17.6 to 20.9) pregnant women who had at least one OGTT were diagnosed to have GDM. Women who had prediabetes at the time of confirmation of pregnancy had a significantly higher risk of developing GDM (RR 2.08, 95%CI 1.45 to 2.97). Other risk factors independently associated with GDM were woman’s age (adjusted OR (AOR) 1.10, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.15) and BMI (AOR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.07). Higher maternal height was found to be protective factor for GDM (AOR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.00). Women with GDM, received appropriate treatment did not h

Gestational weight gain and pregnancy outcomes: Findings from North Indian pregnancy cohort,"['Ranadip Chowdhury', 'Nitika Nitika', 'Tarun[...]', 'Nita Bhandari']","Despite the high prevalence of inadequate gestational weight gain (GWG) and adverse pregnancy outcomes, very few studies have addressed the association between GWG and pregnancy outcomes in South Asia. Our objectives were to estimate the prevalence of GWG during the second and third trimesters within, below and above the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines, and to estimate the effect of the rate and adequacy of GWG on gestational age at the time of delivery, weight, length, length-forage z-score (LAZ), weight-for-length z-score (WLZ) and adverse pregnancy outcomes, namely prematurity, small-for-gestational age (SGA), low birth weight (LBW), stunting and wasting at birth. We analysed data from the intervention group of the Women and Infants Integrated Interventions for Growth Study (WINGS), which is an ongoing individually randomized factorial design study. Of the 1332 women analysed, 40.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 37.5 to 42.8] had GWG below the IOM guidelines. For every 100-g/week increase in GWG, birth weight increased by 61 g, birth length by 0.16 cm, LAZ score by 0.08 SD, WLZ score by 0.14 SD, and gestational age at birth by 0.48 days. Women with GWG below the IOM guidelines had a higher relative risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (44% for LBW, 27% for SGA, 32% for stunting and 42% for wasting at birth) than women who had GWG within the IOM guidelines, except for prematurity. The association between GWG and LAZ scores at birth was modified by early pregnancy body mass index (BMI). GWG is a strong predictor of newborn anthropometric outcomes and duration of gestation but not prematurity.

Reviewed Work(s): Post-Conflict Institutional Design: Peacebuilding and Democracy in Africa by Abu Bakarr Bah Review by: Michael Nwankpa,['Michael Nwankpa'],"Sadly, post-independent African countries have been saddled with ethnic, natural resources, and poor governance-related conflicts as they face the uphill challenge of nation-building. The heterogeneous and pluralistic nature of African postcolonial countries with their diverse ethnic groups has proven to be a serious challenge to the enjoyment of peace in the continent. Most African states have failed to manage the ethnic differences resulting in many of the civil wars in the continent. Africa’s natural resources have also been identified as a critical factor in Africa’s most brutal civil wars. Africa is endowed with natural resources, but unfortunately, this has not translated into material wealth and prosperity for the millions of African citizens who live in abject poverty. The abundance of natural resources in Africa has become a curse rather than a blessing, as it has provoked a vicious cycle of conflict and political violence. The conflicts in Africa have also been attributed to poor governance by African leaders. It is against this context that Post-Conflict Institutional Design gains salience",Book,,,Jun 20,0,"

"3 Labelling conflict groups in Nigeria: A comparative study of Boko Haram, Niger Delta, IPOB, and Fulani Militia",['Michael Nwankpa'],"In 2011, Nigeria established its first anti-terrorism legislation and Boko Haram was proscribed as a terrorist group in 2014. In 2017, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB)-a secessionist movement in the South-East of Nigeria, became the second conflict group or social movement to be proscribed by the anti-terror law. Unlike Boko Haram, IPOB’s struggle is underlined, to a large extent, by genuine grievance and its modi operandi is largely non-violent. Unsurprisingly, the proscription of IPOB did not generate the same worldwide recognition and support as that of Boko Haram. Rather, it attracted national and international condemnations. Yet, the Nigerian government has not reversed its action. This raises important questions regarding the motivation for proscribing IPOB and the impact on the group’s transformation as well as on other conflict groups and situations across Nigeria. Interestingly, the current government led by President Buhari, a Fulani, has been noticeably silent or at best expressed weak response to the ‘terrorist’ acts committed by the Fulani militia group. Also, the government’s reluctance to proscribe the militant groups in the oil rich Niger Delta region counteracts any argument regarding fairness in the application of the anti-terrorism law. This chapter therefore analyses the characteristics of each conflict group and why they attract the kind of labelling, and the implications of such on the transformation of the conflict group and the benefits or drawbacks to the government and the conflict actors.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Drag Performers’ Perspectives on the Mainstreaming of British Drag: Towards a Sociology of Contemporary Drag,"['Mark McCormack', 'Liam Wignall']","Drag performance has entered mainstream British culture and is gaining unprecedented appreciation and recognition, yet no sociological accounts of this transformation exist. Using an inductive analysis of in-depth interviews with 25 drag performers, alongside netnography of media and other public data, this article develops a sociological understanding of the mainstreaming of drag. There are two clear reasons for the success of drag. First, there is a pull towards drag: it is now seen as a viable career opportunity where performers receive fame rather than social stigma in a more inclusive social zeitgeist, even though the reality is more complex. Second, there is a push away from other creative and performing arts because heteronormative perspectives persist through typecasting and a continued professional stigma associated with drag. In calling for a sociology of drag, future avenues for research on contemporary drag are discussed, alongside the need for the sociology of cultural and creative industries to incorporate sexuality as both a subject and analytic lens.",Article,1.0, Sociology,May 30,0,"

Pilgrimage,"['John Eade', 'Evgenia Mesaritou']","The multifaceted nature of contemporary pilgrimage cannot be understood from one particular discipline and, as a consequence, its study has become increasingly multidisciplinary and global in approach. Anthropologists have made a major contribution to pilgrimage studies but significant research has also been produced by those based in history, religious studies, tourism studies, geography, ethnology and folklore studies, for example, and by those undertaking research outside Europe and North America, including in the Near East, northern and southern Africa, the Asia Pacific region, Oceania, and Latin America. The contemporary practice of pilgrimage is also not restricted to institutional religion. Visits to nonreligious sites have become increasingly popular, reflecting historical change. Large numbers of people are attracted to sites of suffering, such as the First World War battlefields in France, Belgium, and Turkey; the site of the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland and the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, DC, and places associated with icons of popular culture, e.g., Elvis Presley’s grave in Memphis, Tennessee (see Reader and Walter 1993, cited under Development of the Anthropological Study of Pilgrimage). Furthermore, those journeying to and from religious pilgrimage sites have often little or no interest in institutional religion. Moreover, pilgrimage cannot be studied in isolation from wider contexts. Hence, as detailed in various sections in this article, close attention has been paid to the intimate relationship between pilgrimage and tourism, while increasing interest is being shown in the role played by political and economic processes in the development of pilgrimage.

Changes in Sexual Fantasy and Solitary Sexual Practice During Social Lockdown Among Young Adults in the UK,"['Cory J Cascalheira', 'Mark McCormack', 'Emma Portch', 'Liam Wignall']","Introduction: Pandemic-related social lockdown limited many sexual behaviors, but to date, no study has examined the perceived impact of social lockdown due to COVID-19 on sexual fantasy and solitary sexual behavior. Aims: The present study sought to examine the perceived impact of social lockdown on sexual fantasy and solitary sexual behavior among UK young adults in various living situations. Methods: A convenience sample of 565 adults aged 18-32 and living in the UK completed anonymous, web-based, study-specific questionnaires between May 14 and 18, 2020, 7 weeks after social lockdown was initiated. Mixed-method analyses were conducted. Main outcome measures: The study presents qualitative and quantitative data. Criterion variables were measured dichotomously as increases (vs no change) in sexual fantasy and increases (vs no change) in pornography consumption. Predictor variables were living arrangement, relationship status, and postlockdown changes in masturbation and pornography consumption. Results: Of all, 34.3% engaged in more sexual fantasizing during lockdown; women were more likely than men to report this increase. Living context and relationship status were predictors of increased fantasizing. Of all, 30.44% reported an increase in at least one solitary sexual practice. This increase was associated with an increase in sexual fantasizing and also with increased pornography consumption. Nineteen percent of participants reported an increase in pornography use, with men being more likely than women to report this increase. Participants mostly attributed their increases to boredom, increased free time, and replacing partnered sex. Conclusion: Shifts in sexual fantasizing and solitary sexua

The Normalization of Leisure Sex and Recreational Drugs: Exploring Associations Between Polydrug Use and Sexual Practices by English Festival-Goers,"['Mark McCormack', 'Fiona Measham', 'Liam Wignall']","The relationship between drug use and sexual practice is complex. Significant focus has been placed on risky practices, yet the broader associations between drug use and sexual activities remain elusive outside such contexts. This is despite similar trends of liberalizing attitudes and practices being identified in each area, theorized as the normalization of recreational drug use and the liberalization of consensual sexual practice. In this article, we draw on convenience sample surveys of 966 festival-goers at an English music festival in 2016 and 2019 to assess prevalence of polydrug use and to examine whether people who consume illicit drugs are more likely to engage in sexual behaviors considered more liberal than the traditional norm. We show that people who reported polydrug use in the last 12 months were significantly more likely to engage in non-traditional sexual behaviors, including sex with a friend and anal sex, in that same time period. In combining and comparing two usually distinct discourses, this exploratory study suggests that the normalization of drugs and the liberalization of consensual sexual practices are related and can be conceptualized as part of a broader societal acceptance and cultural accommodation of illicit drug use and particular sexual practices as leisure activities, despite markedly different policy and legal contexts for each activity. We conclude that the concept of “normalization” may be more appropriate to understanding changes in sexuality than “liberalization” in the context of “leisure sex” and call for further cross-disciplinary research on drugs and sex using this approach.",Article,1.0, Contemporary Drug Problems,Apr 23,1,"

Changes in Sexual Desire and Behaviors among UK Young Adults During Social Lockdown Due to COVID-19,"['Liam Wignall', 'Emma Portch', 'Mark McCormack[...]', 'Terri Cole']","This study examined self-reported changes in young adults' sexual desire and behaviors during the most significant social restrictions imposed to deal with COVID-19. Drawing on a survey of 565 British adults aged 18-32 collected at the peak of social lockdown restrictions, we document an overall decrease in sexual behaviors consistent with abiding by social restrictions. We found that the levels of sexual desire reported by women (but not men) decreased compared with reports of pre-lockdown levels. Participants in serious relationships reported more increases in sexual activity than people who were single or dating casually, and there were significant differences according to gender and sexual orientation. The perceived impact of subjective wellbeing of people with high sociosexuality scores was disproportionately associated with social lockdown but there was no effect for general health. Thus, the impact on sexuality and general wellbeing should be considered by policymakers when considering future social restrictions related to COVID-19 or other public health emergencies.",Article,1.0, The Journal of Sex Research,Apr 5,1,"

Indigenous Peoples,['Jeremie Gilbert'],"The rights of indigenous peoples under international law have evolved greatly since the late 1980s. Efforts by indigenous peoples to get their rights recognized under international law started during the League of Nations in the early 1920s, but it was only in 2007 that the General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) adopted the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). The adoption of the declaration not only marks an important moment in terms of lawmaking; it also represents the achievement of long decades of lobbying and advocacy from indigenous peoples’ representatives. The UN declared the decade 1994–2004 as the First International Decade of the World’s Indigenous Peoples, and later 2005–2015 was declared the second such decade. The main objective was the strengthening of international cooperation for the solution of problems faced by indigenous people in such areas as human rights, the environment, education, and health. As a result, in 2002, the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues was established as an advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council. But it was only in 2007 that the UN General Assembly adopted the UNDRIP, which universally proclaims and consolidates a specific international legal corpus of rights for indigenous peoples. The adoption of the declaration is representative of the significant legal developments of the rights of indigenous peoples under international law. The international legal framework concerns general human rights such as nondiscrimination and equality, as well as very specific collective rights such as self-determination, cultural rights, land rights, and control over natural resources.

The Invention of Sacred Places and Rituals: A Comparative Study of Pilgrimage,['John Eade'],"During the last twenty years around the world there has been a rapid increase in the number of people visiting long established religious shrines as well as the creation of new sites by those operating outside the boundaries of institutional religion. This increase is intimately associated with the revival of traditional routes, the creation of new ones and the invention of new rituals (religious, spiritual and secular). To examine this process I will focus on the European region and two contrasting destinations in particular-the Catholic shrine of Lourdes, France, and the pre-Christian shrine of Avebury, England-drawing on my personal involvement in travelling to both destinations and being involved in ritual activities along the route and at the two destinations. In the discussion section of the paper I will explore the relevance of these two case studies to the analysis of power, agency and performance and the ways in which they expose (a) the role of institutions and entrepreneurs in creating rituals and sacred places and (b) the relationship between people and the domesticated landscape.",Preprint,,,Mar 26,0,"

The article then moves on to analyse self-declaration, part of the proposed reform recently dismissed by the Government. While self-declaration contains provisions that would minimise the length of the process of recognition as well as the level of intrusiveness and stigma associated with it, this analysis highlights some fundamental theoretical concerns with its over-reliance on the strict dialectical logics on recognition and its structural inability to account for and respond to the challenges posed by non-binary trans individuals.",Article,1.0, Law and Critique,,0,"

Boko Haram has remained active and dangerous, despite the relatively successful counter-terrorism and counter insurgency efforts by the Nigerian military, the regional counterterrorism force, and assistance from the international community. Several publications on Boko Haram have shed light on its different aspects and manifestations, but questions remain.

However, Boko Haram, a Salafi Jihadist group seeking to establish a Sharia state in Nigeria, has shown the capacity to survive and adapt.

Sacralising the Landscape: Water and the Development of a Pilgrimage Shrine,['John Eade'],"This chapter will explore the ways in which Roman Catholic institutions seek to control nature in the form of water through the process of sacralisation. I begin with an historical overview of sacralising the landscape through Catholic pilgrimage and then introduce two theoretical approaches within pilgrimage studies (the phenomenological and relational) towards this process in the context of contemporary pilgrimage. This leads to a detailed case study of Lourdes, one of the most popular European pilgrimage shrines, where the landscape has been radically altered through the process of sacralisation where two types of water-the spring uncovered by St Bernadette during her visions in 1858 and associated with 'miraculous' healing and the river Gave-play an ever-present and potentially disruptive role. I focus particularly on the internal landscape of the baths where people engage intimately with the spring water and draw on my own experience of working as a helper between 1968 and 1992 and then again between 2013 and 2017. This enables me to explore the sensuous experience of bathing and issue of risk and trust by drawing on both discursive representations and the relational perspective. This eclectic approach also helps us to place Lourdes and its changing landscape within a wider environmental and political-economic context. Nature and Place Pilgrimage The subjugation of nature by human institutions to create an ordered, predictable and 'sacred' landscape has a long history. Machu Pichu, Stonehenge, Rome, Jerusalem, Mecca and Varanasi are just some of the most famous pilgrimage sites where landscapes reveal how the local habitat has been sacralised in the pursuit of religious interests.

Welfarisation: Women's experiences of drug policy,['Natasha Du Rose'],"Chapter 6 discusses the social welfare strand of drug policy discourse and the technology of welfarisation. Welfarisation constructs individuals or groups as needing social support or constitutes them as unworthy of it. How female drug users are targeted for welfarisation or ‘soft-policing’ through formal and informal social control mechanisms is explored. Interventions in the lives of female users presented as policies and practices of welfare (concerned with their well-being) are often experienced as intrusive, coercive and punitive. This chapter investigates the surveillance and regulation of drug using women through welfare and social work policies and practices. Some contextual background including neoliberal policies focusing on risk and responsibility is provided. How welfarisation policies such as the denial of social security benefits and social work interventions impact on female users and their children is discussed. According to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) in Hidden harm, the children of drug-using parents are likely to be exposed to a range of hazards ‘as a result of parental problem drug use’ (ACMD, 2011, p 10, emphasis added). These include physical and emotional abuse or neglect, dangerously inadequate supervision, toxic substances in the home and exposure to criminal or other inappropriate adult behaviour. However, also included in the list of problems apparently caused by drug use are poverty, inadequate accommodation and unsatisfactory education (ACMD, 2011). Drug-using parents are therefore responsibilised for a range of social problems they may experience, which are constituted as in their control and as an outcome of their behaviour. The

Gender-collaborative training in elite university sport: Challenging gender essentialism through integrated training in gender-segregated sports,"['MF Ogilvie', 'Mark McCormack']","Competitive teamsport at university level is predominantly segregated by gender in many western countries, despite concerns that gender segregation in sport can perpetuate sexism and gender inequality. While policies and activities seek to challenge sexism and gender inequality, the use of gender collaboration within a gender-segregated system as a method to achieve this has received little attention. In this article, we draw on a year-long ethnography of elite sport and 48 in-depth interviews with elite male and female athletes at a British university to explore the impact of various forms of gender mixing during training, which we call ‘gender-collaborative training’. While men’s and women’s teams competing against each other in practice matches resulted in gender-essentialist narratives attributing difference to biology, gender-integrated practices and workouts provided opportunities for men and women to train together without the gendered sport-specific associations that can reproduce sexism. We call for gender-collaborative training to be adopted by gender-segregated teams, and suggest that where there is resistance to any integration, teams start with mixed physical workouts and progress to mixed sport-specific training and then mixed competitive training.",Article,0.0, International Review for the Sociology of Sport,"Dec 27, 2020",0,"

Older Iranian Muslim women’s experiences of sex and sexuality: A biographical approach,"['Elham Amini', 'Mark McCormack']","Muslim women in Iran live in a patriarchal society which significantly restricts their freedom and agency. While there is a growing understanding of social change as it relates to younger Muslim women in Iran, the perspectives and experiences of older women are marginalized; mirroring problems with the intersections of age, gender, and sexuality in the West. In order to address this occlusion, this article draws on life history interviews with 30 older Muslim women living in Tehran and Karaj. Adopting a biographical life course approach, and examining pivotal moments related to sexuality in their lives, we discuss how cultural meanings and symbols of sexuality have emerged and been negotiated by these women at the life stages of puberty, first sex at marriage, and menopause. The patriarchal and religious gender order of Iran transgresses these women's human rights so that sexuality is experienced as a source of shame, stigma, and pollution, yet the women also exert forms of agency in their lives as they adopt and challenge these norms.",Article,0.0, British Journal of Sociology,,0,"

Transnational Labour Solidarity as Transformative Practice: Reframing the Role of Labour Transnationalism,['Katherine Nastovski'],"In the 1980s and 1990s, a significant number of rank-and-file trade union activists in Canada became actively engaged in various forms of international labour solidarity. This activity, the end of the Cold War and the increasing impacts of neo-liberal globalisation combined to spark hopes for greatly expanding practices of labour transnationalism. This vision of transnationalising trade union organisation has not materialised and, in fact, inside Canadian unions there has been declining faith in the possibilities of building transnational solidarity. Starting with an analysis of the dominant dichotomies underlying the literature on labour transnationalism, I suggest that stepping outside these dichotomies can provide a different way of assessing the role of transnational labour solidarity within broader struggles for workers’ justice. In this article, drawing upon the case of transnational political solidarities built by workers inside Canadian unions in the 1980s and 1990s, I argue that assessing transnational practices with a longer view to class formation and the goals of workers’ emancipation can help to expand conceptions of what constitutes successful transnational practice. Such a reassessment of the role of labour transnationalism is particularly timely in the current context of right-wing populism.",Article,1.0, Global Labour Journal,,0,"

We argue women exercise “tactic agency” in captivity in ways that are, taken together, “law‐making” in their contestations over the socio‐legal categories of marriage. Their contestations of marriage impact the norms within rebel groups as well as the development of new crimes against humanity in international criminal law.

"Place, power, difference: Multiscale research at the dawn of the twenty-first century","['L.L. Gezon', 'Sydney Paulson']","Innovations and debates within political ecology, as well as critiques of the approach as a whole, have motivated serious reflection about the methods, concepts, and studies that make up this relatively new field. As environmental issues become increasingly prominent in local struggles, national debates, and international policies, scholars are paying more attention to conventional politics and to more broadly defined relations of power and difference in interactions among human groups and their biophysical environments. This move has generated questions about the role of politics in environmental scholarship and practice as well as concerns that ardent attention to political phenomena may leave ecological detail in the shadows. In efforts to work more closely with political, economic, and ecological concerns and phenomena, political ecologists have pursued several promising paths: they have looked beyond the local community to explain natural resource use, explored power dynamics in everyday interactions and formal policy arenas, and paid increasing attention to the environmental interests, knowledge, and practices of social groups differentiated by race, ethnicity, gender, or other factors. © 2005 by Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.

Locating the Political in Political Ecology: An Introduction,"['Sydney Paulson', 'Lisa L. Gezon', 'Michael Watts']","Recent debates within political ecology have motivated serious reflection about key concepts and methods in this relatively new field. In the introduction to this special issue, we briefly chart the intellectual genealogy of political ecology, identify vital challenges faced today, and present a new set of studies that respond to these concerns. We conceptualize power as a social relation built on the asymmetrical distribution of resources and risks and locate power in the interactions among, and the processes that constitute, people, places, and resources. Politics, then, are found in the practices and mechanisms through which such power is circulated. The focus here is on politics related to the environment, understood as biophysical phenomena, together with human knowledge and practice. To apply these concepts, we promote multiscale research models that articulate selected ecological phenomena and local social processes, together with regional and global forces and ideas. We also advocate methods for research and practice that are sensitive to relations of difference and power among and within social groups. Rather than dilute ecological dimensions of study, this approach aims to strengthen our ability to account for the dialectical processes through which humans appropriate, contest, and manipulate the world around them.",Article,3.0, Human Organization,,0,"

The effects of Asian population substructure on Y STR forensic analyses,"['Bruce Budowle', 'Jianye Ge', 'Joyce Low[...]', 'Ranajit Chakraborty']","A total of 3046 males of Chinese, Malay, Thai, Japanese, and Indian population affinity were previously typed for the Y STR loci DYS19, DYS385 (counted as two loci), DYS389I, DYS389II, DYS390, DYS391, DYS392, DYS393, DYS437, DYS438, DYS439, DYS456, DYS458, DYS635, DYS448, and Y GATA H4 using the AmpFlSTR Yfiler kit. These samples were assessed for population genetic parameters that impact forensic statistical calculations. All population samples were highly polymorphic for the 16 Y STR markers with the marker DYS385 being the most polymorphic, because it is comprised of two loci. Most (2677 out of a total of 2806 distinct haplotypes) of the 16 marker haplotypes observed in the sample populations were represented only once in the data set. Haplotype diversities were greater than 99.57% for the Chinese, Malay, Thai, Japanese, and Indian sample populations. For the Y STR markers, population substructure correction was considered when calculating the rarity of a Y STR profile. An F(ST) value, rather than a R(ST) value, is more appropriate under a forensic model. Because the F(ST) values are very small within the Asian populations, the estimate of the rarity of a haplotype comprised of 10-16 markers does not need substructure correction. However haplotypes with fewer markers may require F(ST) corrections when calculating the rarity of the profile.",Article,8.0, Legal Medicine,Nov 17,0,"

The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and local institutions in Ghana’s mining communities: Challenges in understanding barriers to accountability,"['Hevina S. Dashwood', 'Uwafiokun Idemudia', 'Bill Buenar Puplampu', 'Kernaghan Webb']","Motivation The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is a global standard that promotes transparency and accountability in resource-rich countries to improve governance of the extractive sector. Despite improvements in the subnational disclosure of royalty payments, a significant problem is the failure of these efforts to improve accountability and benefits to mining communities. Purpose The article asks how institutions of local governance affect national efforts to improve accountability to mining communities in Ghana on the use of mineral revenues for development. It contributes to the broader theoretical literature on EITI by clarifying what outcomes, if any, can be directly attributed to the disclosure of royalty payments. Methods and approach This qualitative study employs a case-study analysis of EITI adoption in Ghana, one of the first countries to join the initiative. The article contextualizes local governance institutions and dynamics in relation to the royalty disbursement process. It draws on original field research to analyse their role in impeding the expected benefits of royalty disbursements to mining-affected communities. Findings The research identifies deficiencies in local governance structures and processes as they relate to the use of mineral royalties, but also instances of variation in how officials react to EITI. The range of individual actors, institutions and complex processes on which the subnational disbursement of royalties depends, makes it problematic to attribute the absence of improvements directly to Ghana’s EITI. The findings demonstrate that EITI’s role in participating countries is best understood as facilitative and indirect when addressing development outcomes for mining commu

Africa and Food Security,"['Logan Cochrane', 'Melisew Dejene Lemma', 'Nathanael Ojong', 'W C Sambu']","As United Nations Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, noted at the 2021 Africa Regional Food Systems Summit Dialogue, food insecurity is rising in many African countries (see 13 July 2021 address). The global pandemic has not only put global health inequality on display; it has also done the same for food security: nearly one out of five Africans experienced hunger in 2020 – more than double the proportion of any other region. This policy brief highlights the current situation, noting countries with a high prevalence of food insecurity as well as countries where large numbers of people experience hunger. We note the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food security as well as the negative consequences of food insecurity from a nutritional perspective. Before looking forward, this policy brief examines the historical context of social policies and safety nets, using a selection of contemporary case studies. It concludes with recommendations for protecting the right to food for all people at all times (e.g., investing in better data, best fit design, expanding coverage, moving beyond quantity to quality, nutritional diversity and food safety) as well as enabling food system change (e.g., enhancing resilience, transforming systems).",Technical Report,,,Oct 20,0,"

Introduction to climate justice communication (in Research Handbook on Communicating Climate Change),"['Anna Roosvall', 'Matthew Tegelberg']","Theme VIII. Climate Justice Communication: This theme consists of two chapters, one largely theoretical piece, drawing on previous studies to suggest future directions for research, and one applied case study. Both chapters discuss the situations of Indigenous peoples and illuminate challenges of communicating climate justice across diverse communicational and geographical contexts. Roosvall and Tegelberg (Chapter 22) detail how attention to economic, cultural, and political justice must be combined with attention to geographical scope, suggesting that future research consider how geographical scales are combined or disconnected in climate change reporting for diverse types of media. In Chapter 23, Yagodin applies a pluralistic climate justice approach, which includes justice for nature, and zooms in on Russian climate change reporting. He examines how calls for climate justice were largely excluded from journalistic, but not NGO, framings of the 2016 anthrax outbreak on the Yamal peninsula. Together, these contributions highlight possibilities and challenges for justly communicating about climate justice.

"“Let’s Not Have the Perfect Be the Enemy of the Good”: Social Impact Bonds, Randomized Controlled Trials, and the Valuation of Social Programs",['James Williams'],"This article uses the case of “social impact bonds” (SIBs) to explore the role of social science methods in new markets in “social investment.” Pioneered in the UK in 2010, SIBs use private capital to fund social programs with governments paying returns for successful outcomes. Central to the SIB model is the question of evaluation and the method to be used in determining program outcomes and investor returns. In the United States, the randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been the dominant method. However, this has not been without controversy. Some SIB practitioners and investors have argued that, while this may be the perfect tool, the need to grow the SIB market demands a more pragmatic approach. Drawing from a three-year study of SIBs, and informed by Science and Technology Studies (STS)-inspired work on valuation and the social life of methods, the article explores RCTs as both a valuation technology central to SIB design and the object of a micropolitics of valuation which has impeded market growth. It is the relationship between, and the politics of, evaluation and valuation that is a key lesson of the SIB experiment and an important insight for future research on “social investment” and other settings where methods are constitutive of financial value.",Article,1.0," Science, Technology & Human Values",Oct 12,0,"

Formalizing Secularism as a Regime of Restrictions and Protections: The Case of Quebec (Canada) and Geneva (Switzerland),['Amelie Barras'],"In 2019, the province of Quebec and the canton of Geneva passed bills establishing their states as “secular.” While each law is, to a certain extent, context specific, both present noteworthy similarities. First, neutrality (the cornerstone of laïcité ) is articulated around two elements: (1) restrictions that affect the religious practices of public servants belonging to minority religions and (2) protections for Christian symbols constructed as “cultural.” The article questions the implications for inclusive citizenship of formalizing regulatory regimes that differentiate between “religion” and “culture.” Second, a comparative lens enables an analysis of how, through whom, and why similar regimes of regulation travel from one area of the world to another. The article argues for the importance of considering transnational influences when analyzing the regulation of religion to better (1) understand why particular models of secularism gain traction and (2) capture power dynamics structuring these processes of traction.",Article,1.0, Canadian journal of law and society = Revue canadienne de droit et société,Oct 9,0,"

Life after trafficking: reintegration experiences of human trafficking survivors in Nigeria,"['Uwafiokun Idemudia', 'Nnenna Okoli', 'Mary Goitom', 'Sylvia Bawa']","Purpose Reintegration programs have emerged as part of the regimes of care for survivors of human trafficking. However, empirical analysis of the reintegration outcomes for survivors remains limited in the African context. Hence, this paper aims to examine the challenges and opportunities of reintegration assistance programs for survivors of human trafficking in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on qualitative methods of data collection and analysis, this study conducted semi-structured interviews with repatriated women who have accessed reintegration assistance in Nigeria, and data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings The findings suggest that while the reintegration programs might address the procedural aspect of reintegration, the achievement of substantive reintegration remains incomplete. This is because of the structural conditions of the context within which reintegration is supposed to occur. Practical implications There is a need to take seriously the distinction between the reintegration of survivors into a new community or a former community in the design of a regime of care for survivors of human trafficking in Africa. Crucially, the focus on procedural reintegration should not also divert attention away from the structural conditions and reforms needed to ensure survivors achieve substantive reintegration. Originality/value This paper contributes to the limited literature on life after trafficking and demonstrates the strengths and limitations of reintegration programs as a regime of care for survivors of human trafficking. In addition, this study empirically grounded the theoretical distinction between different aspects of the process of reintegration.",Article,1.0," International Journal of Migration, Health and Social Care",Sep 15,0,"

This paper explores the shifting role of the state in CSR, and the way the features of a state affect CSR in the context of a developing country. The paper adopts a strategic-relational approach that recognises the variability in state capacities over time and space. Empirically, it draws upon secondary sources and interviews with stakeholder groups. Our findings reveal the complex nature of CSR and the dynamic, yet resilient, role of state actors in a context of strong state–business interdependence, institutional incompatibility, and fragmented powers across diverse state branches. While the state (re)claims control over CSR when its socio-economic goals are challenged, it tends to move from emphasising state control to co-ordinating complex modes of CSR governance.",Conference Paper,,,Aug 13,0,"

Contemporary slavery: The rhetoric of global human rights campaigns,"['Annie Bunting', 'J. Quirk']","This volume brings together a cast of leading experts to carefully explore how the history and iconography of slavery has been invoked to support a series of government interventions, activist projects, legal instruments, and rhetorical performances. However well-intentioned these interventions might be, they nonetheless remain subject to a host of limitations and complications. Recent efforts to combat contemporary slavery are too often sensationalist, self-serving, and superficial and, therefore, end up failing the crucial test of speaking truth to power. The widely held notion that antislavery is one of those rare issues that ""transcends"" politics or ideology is only sustainable because the underlying issues at stake have been constructed and demarcated in a way that minimizes direct challenges to dominant political and economic interests. This must change. By providing an original approach to the underlying issues at stake, Contemporary Slavery will help readers understand the political practices that have been concealed beneath the popular rhetoric and establishes new conversations between scholars of slavery and trafficking and scholars of human rights and social movements.",Book,,,Aug 2,0,"

Can “the oven bird” Migrate North of the border?,['Annie Bunting'],"In David Engel’s elegant 1984 piece “The Oven Bird’s Song: Insiders, Outsiders, and Personal Injuries in an American Community, he documents legal perceptions of residents of the pseudonymous Sander County, Illinois that were disconnected from the legal realities he measured, and concluded that these perceptions were reactions to social change that produced greater pluralism in the community. This gave rise to “symbolic efforts … to preserve a sense of meaning and coherence in the face of social changes that they found threatening and confusing. Residents sought to “recall and reaffirm an untainted world that existed nowhere but in their imaginations. These conclusions are fascinating and prescient, and have led many of us since then to probe legal perceptions in the face of growing normative pluralism. Much like the study of residents of Sander County in Engel’s “Oven Bird’s Song, Carole Greenhouse writes about perceptions of disputes and litigation in a small town she calls Hopewell in Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town (1986). In Greenhouse’s preface, she discusses her own assumptions going into her study. She writes: I went to Hopewell in September 1973 to study dispute settlement in an American community, and my assumption, or hope, was that the role of the court in the social fabric of a town would be thrown into relief if the community was in the process of change. The rest of the book should make it clear why such a legal study was not possible in this community and also how it is that one can begin a study of an American community by looking for conflict and end by considering a person’s relationship to God.

Humanitarian and Human Rights Surveillance: The Challenge to Border Surveillance and Invisibility?,['Ozgun Topak'],"The European border regime has traditionally rested on the hidden surveillance activities of border authorities, which have contributed to human rights violations (including “push-back” and “left-to-die” practices) and a rising migrant death toll. Recently a number of humanitarian and activist organizations, including Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Sea-Watch, and WatchTheMed, have organized to aid migrants in distress at sea using surveillance technologies, ranging from drones to GPS. By doing so, they presented a challenge to the European border surveillance regime. In dialogue with the concept of countersurveillance, this paper introduces the concepts of humanitarian surveillance and human rights surveillance and deploys them to examine and categorize the activities of MOAS, MSF, Sea-Watch, and WatchTheMed. Humanitarian surveillance narrowly focuses on aiding victims of surveillance without problematizing the logic and hierarchies of surveillance, while human rights surveillance operates as a form of countersurveillance; it aims to protect and advance the human rights of victims of surveillance and expose human rights violations committed by authorities through opposing the hierarchies of surveillance. The paper shows how civilian groups incorporate elements of humanitarian and human rights surveillance in their activities at varying levels and discusses the extent to which they challenge the European border surveillance regime.",Article,9.0, Surveillance & Society,Jul 15,0,"

"Migrant protest in times of crisis: politics, ethics and the sacred from below",['Ozgun Topak'],"This paper focuses on the 300 Migrant Hunger Strikers event in Greece to explore the material conditions of possibility for migrant politics in times of crisis. It identifies three elements that played determinant roles in the articulation of the event: the politics of equality enacted by migrants, the ethics of hospitality and witnessing enacted by the Greek activists and host populations and the sacredness of the event. Critically engaging with the theories of Rancière, Derrida, Agamben and Durkheim, this paper demonstrates how these elements encountered and how their encounter helped migrants to achieve rights, albeit limited and temporary. Moving beyond the particularity of the event, this paper also highlights the event’s importance for migrant politics in times of austerity, and increased surveillance and racism against migrants. Despite its limited and temporary success, the event demonstrates how a politics of equality, ethical openness and respect for human life can form the basis of true cosmopolitan universality. The event also demonstrates how cosmopolitan universality is constructed from below by the migrants, who despite their undocumented status, engaged in an act of citizenship to demand equality.",Article,6.0, Citizenship Studies,,0,"

The New Borders of the European Union: Digital Surveillance and Social Sorting,['Ozgun Topak'],"n this paper the emergence of the digital borders in the EU is analyzed. Alt- hough borders have always been the spaces where individuals are sorted from each other, the database technologies extend this process of sorting to every- where within the EU. The developments in the database and biometrics technology have made it possible to identify people automatically and to reach their records even long after they have entered the EU. Digitization and diffusion of the borders will affect the already disadvantaged segments of the population, such as undocumented migrants, asylum seekers and ordinary travellers, in a negative way. These categories are now put under continual surveillance as if they are potential criminals or terrorists. Yet, the diffusion of the borders with digital technologies should not mean that the localized controls at the external borders have lost their significance. In fact, with the EUROSUR, now the territorial controls have also intensified. The EUROSUR will survey the external EU borders with sophisticated surveillance systems, including manned and un- manned aerial vehicles and satellites, in order prevent irregular migrants from reaching the EU. This paper is divided into three main sections. In the discussion that follows, the paper draws on the surveillance and border studies literature to develop a con- ceptual framework for understanding the digital borders. Second, the paper ex- amines the new EU surveillance mechanisms in detail and their effects on dif- ferent groups. The final section concludes by summarizing the arguments of the paper and discussing the consequences of digital sorting on European citizenship.",Chapter,,,,0,"

This paper presents a systematic review of 79 scholarly papers on the topic of solar home system adoption, energy consumption, and social practices in South Asia. Using an intersectionality lens, the paper demonstrates that various categories of difference, such as gender, age, class, and ethnicity, intersect and shape the adoption of this technology in South Asia. Utilizing a social practice theory lens, the paper shows that solar home systems shape the spatial and temporal arrangements and practices of members of households that have adopted the technology, as well as their counterparts who have not. This technology has a practical but also symbolic function; the symbolic function and social meaning are derived from the economic and socio-cultural contexts. As this renewable energy technology is embedded in economic and socio-cultural contexts, people reconfigure it in creative ways to meet their everyday energy needs.

Heterogeneous Combustion of Porous Graphite Particles in Normal and Microgravity,"['Harsha Chelliah', 'Fletcher Miller', 'David Pantano', 'Aslan Kasimov']","Combustion of solid fuel particles has many important applications, including power generation and space propulsion systems. The current models available for describing the combustion process of these particles, especially porous solid particles, include various simplifying approximations. One of the most limiting approximations is the lumping of the physical properties of the porous fuel with the heterogeneous chemical reaction rate constants. The primary objective of the present work is to develop a rigorous model that could decouple such physical and chemical effects from the global heterogeneous reaction rates. For the purpose of validating this model, experiments with porous graphite particles of varying sizes and porosity are being performed at NASA Lewis Research Center.

I critically compare and assess the campaign against South African apartheid in the 1980s and the more recent efforts to oppose Israeli apartheid. Both campaigns are examples of grassroots international labor solidarity, where organizers sought to build international solidarity through member mobilization and a focus on the power of workers to engage in solidarity actions. I examine how these union activists organized within their unions, and how their organizational differences and the ideological and political contexts they organized within shaped their successes and limitations. Drawing from the work of Antonio Gramsci, I argue that these campaigns were sites of counter-hegemonic practice both because of the analysis and critiques they offered but also because of the nature of their organizing.",Article,4.0, WorkingUSA,,0,"

Of the 440 TB patients (62.5% men, 51% foreign born, 9.6% with HIV infection) 65% were initially hospitalized. The total treatment duration was 210 (+/-108) days on average. Only 75% of the patients who were treated by a total of 410 hospital and primary care physicians were treated with standard regimens according to guidelines. 3 patients were treatment failures; 13 relapsed (5.1% of the 257 patients reexamined in 1995). Possible causes for relapses were poor patient compliance due to alcoholism, homelessness, drug addiction, psychiatric disorders; prescription errors with inadequate treatment durations, concurrent AIDS disease, or use of a three-drug combination despite primary drug resistance. In 4 of the relapse patients and in all 3 treatment failures, secondary drug resistance developed under treatment. 5 of these 7 patients were treated initially only with a fixed three-drug regimen (Rifater). The relatively high INH resistance rate (8.6%) and relapse rate (5.1%) in the Canton of Zurich renders the use of a four-drug combination therapy necessary. In the outpatient maintenance phase, more effort must be devoted to ensuring patient compliance and adherence to a proper treatment duration. This should be documented by a standardized questionnaire at 6 or 12 months after initiation of therapy. In high risk patients in particular, home care visits by a TB nurse in addition to consultations by primary care physicians are ne

"Female entrepreneurship in Africa: A review, trends, and future research directions","['Nathanael Ojong', 'Amon Simba', 'Léo-Paul Dana']","There has been a significant increase in scholarly literature about female entrepreneurship in Africa. In order to take stock of the state of female entrepreneurship on that continent, this paper examines articles published in peer-reviewed journals over the period 1987 to 2019. Using a mixed embeddedness approach, the analysis of these articles shows how cultural, institutional, economic, political, and social contexts shape the resources and strategies used by female entrepreneurs, and in turn, the interactions between the contexts, resources, and strategies determine the outcomes of female entrepreneurship in Africa. We argue that the environments in which female entrepreneurs are embedded lead to the development of innovative strategies and ways of gaining access to diverse resources. More papers on female entrepreneurship in Africa were published between 2015 and 2019 than in the previous 27 years. A comprehensive analysis of the articles sampled for this systematic literature review has led to the development of new insights and opportunities for future research.",Article,1.0, Journal of Business Research,Apr 24,0,"

"The rise of solar home systems in sub-Saharan Africa: Examining gender, class, and sustainability",['Nathanael Ojong'],"Sub-Saharan Africa has been hailed as a rising star with respect to the adoption of renewable energy technologies, including solar home systems (SHSs). So, how do forms of social difference shape the adoption of SHSs in sub-Saharan Africa? To address this question, this study conducts a systematic review of the academic literature on SHSs in sub-Saharan Africa. Our findings indicate that gender intersects with age, geographical location, and other inequalities to shape the adoption of SHSs. The adoption of SHSs may reproduce the structures that determine power and resource allocation at the local level. Because of various factors, including decision-making power, control over resources, gendered division of labour, and gendered domestic space, the uptake of SHSs has implications for how and when women perform household chores. From a Weberian perspective, the adoption of SHSs in several communities in sub-Saharan Africa is also grounded in class-based and status-based explanations. SHSs are powerful forces for the reproduction of power relations as well as vehicles for the reconfiguration of social hierarchies. Culture is a double-edged sword that both fosters the adoption of SHSs and hinders that adoption. Based on our analysis, we suggest opportunities for future research.",Article,1.0, Energy Research & Social Science,Mar 21,0,"

The Ethics and Politics of Love and Freedom in J. M. Coetzee’s Age of Iron,['Farzad Shahinfard'],"Age of Iron is the only novel in J. M. Coetzee’s oeuvre that makes explicit references to the context of late-apartheid South Africa. Strictly speaking, the novel is about the challenges of overcoming the iron logic of the age, i.e. the very rationality of the apartheid regime. Thus, the novel has important implications not only for the context within which it is situated but also for the struggles that have since shaped South Africa. This paper attempts to provide a dialectical alternative to poststructuralist and Levinasian readings of the novel. It examines the ethics and politics of love and freedom in the novel and follows the itinerary of these concepts to the question of forgiveness. Specifically, I argue that Mrs. Curren, the narrator and heroine of the story, can be understood through the lens of the Hegelian Unhappy Consciousness, that is, as the “dual” consciousness of mastery and slavery. As such, she is obsessed with questions of freedom (mastery and slavery), forgiveness, love, evil, and salvation, among others. Through the mediation of its Unhappy Consciousness, in fact, the novel renders possible the transition from the nightmarish real of late-apartheid to a real figuration of a different future.",Article,1.0, Critique Studies in Contemporary Fiction,Mar 12,0,"

Governance and governability: indigenous small-scale fisheries and autonomy in coastal Nicaragua,['Miguel Gonzalez'],"This paper describes recent changes in the social and economic conditions of small-scale fisheries on the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua. It examines these conditions in relation to governance challenges faced by indigenous peoples, for whom access to fisheries and tenure rights to land and waters are critical components of their livelihoods. The titling of large swaths of land under a collective property regime, combined with uncontrolled immigration by non-indigenous, campesino settlers, and the weakening of traditional forms of authority have generated a scenario where conflicts are frequent, while negotiation—when it occurs—often expresses historical injustice and power imbalances between the state and indigenous peoples. What institutional impediments currently affect the governability of indigenous, small-scale fisheries along the Caribbean Coast, and how can they be addressed? In order to answer this question, the paper examines three factors that influence the structural position of indigenous peoples with regard to fisheries: changes in tenure regimes, tensions between hierarchical versus decentralized governance modes, and the consequences of legally fragmented, “mosaic” governance patterns. The paper draws theoretical insights from the literature on interactive governance and legal pluralism to propose that in a scenario of contested entitlements, actions for improving self-governance and mobilizing agency offer potential for improving governability and respect for indigenous human rights.",Article,8.0, Maritime Studies,,1,"

"The importance of the matters, geographies, and mediations of justice","['Anna Roosvall', 'Matthew Tegelberg']","This chapter draws upon existing research on media and climate justice to outline an agenda for future research on climate justice communication. By focusing on the challenges faced particularly by Indigenous and other frontline communities around the world, we demonstrate that this agenda must pay close heed to geographical scales and how these are (dis)connected in climate change reporting. Drawing on Fraser (2014), we outline how diverse matters of justice (economic, cultural, political) interact as conditions for climate justice. By detailing key areas, concepts and analytical distinctions, we offer a way forward in terms of communicating climate justice as well as for researching climate change communication through a lens of justice theory and analysis. The chapter ultimately illuminates how the intersection between matters of justice, geographical scales and diverse media (local, national, transnational) make communicating demands for climate justice such a challenging task; yet one filled with opportunities.

The Importance of Being Cultural: Nationalist Thought and Jagan's Colonial World,['Nalini Persram'],"Small Axe 8.1 (2004) 82-105 In 1986 Partha Chatterjee's influential work on anticolonial nationalist discourse presented a programmatic framework that viewed nationalism as having three distinct but related ideological moments in the historical emergence of the postcolonial state. The first was characterized by a cultural consciousness enabled by Enlightenment thought but articulated as ""Eastern"" culture; the second, nationalism's power in mobilizing the population, based on a notion of the nonpassive ""Oriental""; and the final, the hegemonic resolution of the non-Western nation with the liberal state and the postcolonial state's entry into Western modernity. Chatterjee claimed general relevance for his theoretical framework and this is what generates this analysis. The theme of this essay is a dual one: it is, one, an account of Jagan's nationalist discourse during the initial period of Guyana's trek from colonial territory to postcolonial state through, two, a critical adaptation of Chatterjee's framework. One of the most important aspects of the critique of Nationalist Thought and the Colonial World involves the ontology of culture, an element that is central to Chatterjee's argument. What I hope to produce is a way of reading the difference between the general framework of Nationalist Thought, which takes India as its case study, and the particular manifestation of Guyanese nationalist thought. That is, by way of metaphor, the difference between a title like Towards Freedom and Forbidden Freedom. One of the tasks of postcolonial theory is to locate agency on the part of the colonial subjects, to find a way for those figures to make visible their subjectivity. This objective is evident in the opening quotation above: alongside the recogni

The struggle of devout Turkish women for full citizenship,['Amelie Barras'],"The article examines the struggle of devout Turkish women for full citizenship. The activists demanded that all Turkish political parties include women wearing headscarves on their electoral lists. No fewer than 60 percent of Turkish women cover their heads in public, and the activists believed it was time these women had a place in formal politics. The first explanation that comes to mind for this state of affairs is the history of repression of conservative religious parties by the secular elites that traditionally occupied key posts in the military, judiciary and bureaucracy. In 1998, for instance, the Turkish Constitutional Court dissolved an AKP predecessor, the Welfare Party, and annulled its coalition government with a far-right party, on the grounds that Welfare threatened secularism. The party waited until February 2008, after taking 47 percent of the overall vote in July 2007 and securing the support of the ultra-right Nationalist Action Party in Parliament, to tackle bans on headscarves in universities.",Article,,,Jan 25,0,"

"Water, sanitation, hygiene and waste disposal practices as COVID-19 response strategy: insights from Bangladesh","['Didar Islam', 'Prantor kumar Mondal', 'Nathanael Ojong[...]', 'Mohammed A. Mamun']","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global emergence, and the absence of a proven vaccine or medicine has led to the implementation of measures to prevent and control the spread of the virus. Wearing protective equipment like mask and gloves, washing hands via soap, frequent use of antiseptic solution and maintaining social distance are being applied globally to reduce the transmission rate. Therefore, this study was intended to investigate water, sanitation and hygienic (WASH) behaviour, protective equipment use and their disposal practices among Bangladeshi residents amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the study aims, data were collected mainly via an online survey and analysed through a set of statistical tools including T test, one-way ANOVA and principal component analysis (PCA). This study found that almost 89.80% of the respondents reported to know about the COVID-19 and its preventive measures. WASH status of the respondents is found quite good, where 94.60% stated to have available potable water, 99% have improved toilet facilities, 95% wash their hands via soap, and 79.80% clean their house and toilets by antiseptic solutions properly. Moreover, nearly 94.50% and 54.80% people reported to use face mask and hand gloves, respectively, but the disposal practice of these protective equipment is inappropriate. More than 50% of people reported disposing of their used mask, gloves and tissue with other household wastes, which is alarming for public health and environmental perspective. Moreover, the WASH and waste disposal practices of the marginal people were found very poor and not at a satisfactory level.

From Smart Borders to Perimeter Security: The Expansion of Digital Surveillance at the Canadian Borders,"['Ozgun Topak', 'Ciara Bracken-Roche', 'Alana Saulnier', 'David Lyon']","Since 2001, border security policy between Canada and the US has morphed from “smart borders” to the present “beyond the border” (perimeter security) agreement resulting in the expansion of new techniques of border surveillance including pre-emptive profiling of travellers and biometric data sharing. In this paper,we argue that these border agreements have increasingly resulted in a changing experience of sovereign power for those crossing the border. This is demonstrated through a discussion of: the major border policies between Canada and the US since 11 September 2001, developed under the influence of US hegemony; how these policies perpetrate a generalised state of exception; and how these policies affect refugees,migrants, and citizens. Reading Agamben’s insights from a sociological perspective, we argue that the presumption of security-through-surveillance erodes border crossers’ human rights, and that some people – those from disadvantaged race/class backgrounds – aremore affected than others by the implementation of the evolving border regime. We also emphasise the contingencies and unintended consequences of the ongoing projects. The conclusion offers brief comments on the consequences of these developments on Canadian identity and points out the directions for future research in this domain.",Article,5.0, Geopolitics,,0,"

A comparative analysis of migration control strategies along the Western and Eastern Mediterranean routes: Sovereign interventions through militarization and deportation,"['Luna Vives', 'Ozgun Topak']","This paper is a historically informed comparative study of militarization and deportation efforts along the Western (Spain-Morocco) and Eastern (Greece-Turkey) Mediterranean migratory routes from 2005 to 2017. Based on extensive fieldwork on both sites, we argue that these two policy instruments go hand-in-hand in the construction of the European Union's anti-immigration border and examine the continu-ities in their implementation along the two extremes of the Mediterranean basin. Our findings indicate that the origins of current militarization and deportation efforts in the Eastern Mediterranean (such as the EUROSUR system and the 'Hot Spots' approach) can be traced back to the Western Mediterranean and that they have been gradually expanded eastwards. Finally, the paper also demonstrates how militarization and deportation initiatives were implemented jointly by sovereign entities (the EU and member states), and by doing so it addresses the recent debates on the status of sovereignty. We provide evidence to support the argument that, rather than disappearing , sovereignty is re-articulated through cooperation among sovereign entities , despite occasional disagreements among them.",Article,8.0, Migration Studies,"Dec 23, 2020",0,"

"What Family Circumstances, During COVID-19, Impact on Parental Mental Health in an Inner City Community in London?","['Lydia Whitaker', 'Claire Cameron', 'Hanan Hauari[...]', ""Margaret O'Brien""]","The introduction of lockdown due to a public health emergency in March 2020 marked the beginning of substantial changes to daily life for all families with young children. Here we report the experience of families from London Borough of Tower Hamlets with high rates of poverty and ethnic and linguistic diversity. This inner city community, like communities worldwide, has experienced a reduction or closure in access to education, support services, and in some cases, a change in or loss of income, job, and food security. Using quantitative survey items ( N = 992), we examined what differences in family circumstances, for mothers and fathers of young children aged 0–5 living in Tower Hamlets, during March 2020 to November 2020, were associated with their mental health status. We measure parental mental health using symptoms of depression (self-report: Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale: PHQ-8), symptoms of anxiety levels (self-report: General Anxiety Disorder: GAD-7), and perceptions of direct loneliness. We find parental mental health difficulties are associated with low material assets (financial security, food security, and children having access to outside space), familial assets (parents time for themselves and parent status: lone vs. cohabiting), and community assets (receiving support from friends and family outside the household). South Asian parents and fathers across ethnicities were significantly more likely to experience mental health difficulties, once all other predictors were accounted for. These contributing factors should be considered for future pandemics, where restrictions on people's lives are put in place, and speak to the importance of reducing financial insecurity and food ins

Forecasting the vaccine uptake rate: An infodemiological study in the US,"['Xingzuo Zhou', 'Yiang Li']","A year following the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China, many countries have approved emergency vaccines. Public-health practitioners and policymakers must understand the predicted populational willingness for vaccines and implement relevant stimulation measures. This study developed a framework for predicting vaccination uptake rate based on traditional clinical data-involving an autoregressive model with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)- and innovative web search queries-involving a linear regression with ordinary least squares/least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and machine-learning with boost and random forest. For accuracy, we implemented a stacking regression for the clinical data and web search queries. The stacked regression of ARIMA (1,0,8) for clinical data and boost with support vector machine for web data formed the best model for forecasting vaccination speed in the US. The stacked regression provided a more accurate forecast. These results can help governments and policymakers predict vaccine demand and finance relevant programs.",Preprint,,,5d ago,1,"

By examining 52 included studies, the review found that disadvantaged learners lacked reliable access to essential learning materials and resources. Families from disadvantaged socio-economic background and those with learning difficulties required extra support services during remote learning. Schools faced unique challenges in delivering inclusive teaching during PHEs.

Ethnic Inequalities in Healthcare Use and Care Quality among People with Multiple Long-Term Health Conditions Living in the United Kingdom: A Systematic Review and Narrative Synthesis,"['Brenda Adongo Hayanga', 'Mai Stafford', 'Laia Bécares']","Indicative evidence suggests that the prevalence of multiple long-term conditions (i.e., conditions that cannot be cured but can be managed with medication and other treatments) may be higher in people from minoritised ethnic groups when compared to people from the White majority population. Some studies also suggest that there are ethnic inequalities in healthcare use and care quality among people with multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs). The aims of this review are to (1) identify and describe the literature that reports on ethnicity and healthcare use and care quality among people with MLTCs in the UK and (2) examine how healthcare use and/or care quality for people with MLTCs compares across ethnic groups. We registered the protocol on PROSPERO (CRD42020220702). We searched the following databases up to December 2020: ASSIA, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science core collection. Reference lists of key articles were also hand-searched for relevant studies. The outcomes of interest were patterns of healthcare use and care quality among people with MLTCs for at least one minoritised ethnic group, compared to the White majority population in the UK. Two reviewers, L.B. and B.H., screened and extracted data from a random sample of studies (10%). B.H. independently screened and extracted data from the remaining studies. Of the 718 studies identified, 14 were eligible for inclusion. There was evidence indicating ethnic inequalities in disease management and emergency admissions among people with MLTCs in the five studies that counted more than two long-term conditions.

The relational navigator: a pedagogical reframing of widening educational participation for care-experienced young people,"['Penny Jane Burke', 'Claire Cameron', 'Emily Fuller', 'Katie Hollingworth']","Young people in state care not only lose support, usually at 18 years of age, but also experience unequal participation in post-secondary education. This has raised concern about the importance of widening participation (WP) for care-experienced young people (CEYP). However, CEYP are often institutionally stigmatised and this could be worsened by WP interventions that are framed by deficit discourses. Weaving together social pedagogies and social justice theories, the article aims to reframe WP away from deficit discourses through recognition of the systemic, structural and cultural inequalities that most CEYP must navigate to access formal education. We introduce the concept of the relational navigator , in which a pedagogical relationship enables the navigator to ‘pilot’ through complex systems and transitional processes in collaboration with, and through ‘walking alongside’, the CEYP with respect to their lived contexts and experiences. This article draws from the reflections of WP navigators situated in two small-scale WP projects, one in an English museum and the other in an Australian university. Our analysis of the reflections of the WP project navigators is offered as a preliminary exploration of the potential the relational navigator as a way to shift deficit discourses and work towards a reframing of WP through a social pedagogical perspective.",Article,1.0, International Journal of Social Pedagogy,Nov 27,0,"

Bone disease in CKD 5D,"['L. Patrier', 'A.-M. Dupuis', 'A. Granger Vallee[...]', 'R. Wilson']","INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Declining renal function is associated with a progressive increase in serum fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) levels. In patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT), high FGF-23 circulating levels have been associated with vascular calcifications and mortality, suggesting that FGF-23 could be a uremic toxin. In this perspective, reducing FGF-23 concentrations in this patient population appears an appealing approach. The purpose of our study was therefore to compare the clearance of FGF-23 between high flux haemodialysis (HD) and on-line haemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) procedures. METHODS: Two groups were defined according to their prevalent RRT modality. 53 patients (29 men, 24 women; median age 73 [range 41-91] years; mean dialysis vintage 4.4 [range 0.5-22.0] years) were included in the HD group while 32 patients (19 men, 13 women; median age 73 [range 40-89] years; mean dialysis vintage 3.5 [range 0.5-36.0] years) were included in the OL-HDF group. Serum pre- and post-dialysis FGF-23 levels were measured using a 2nd generation Human FGF-23 (C-Term) ELISA kit. Dialysis adequacy was assessed by serum urea and creatinine levels, urea single-pool Kt/V, and urea reduction rate. Bone and mineral disorders were evaluated by pre- and post-dialysis calcium and phosphate concentrations, calcium-phosphate product, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels. RESULTS: Median FGF-23 reduction rates were significantly higher with OL-HDF (55.7±25.2 %) versus HD (36.2±28.6 %) procedures (p=0.0331). Similarly, median calculated FGF-23 clearances (OL-HDF 55.0 vs. HD 41.8 ml/min, p = 0.015) and Kt/V (OL-HDF 1.00 vs. HD 0.72, p=0.0001) were significantly s

A New Perspective from Time Use Research on the Effects of Lockdown on COVID-19 Behavioral Infection Risk,"['Jonathan Gershuny', 'Oriel Sullivan', 'Almudena Sevilla[...]', 'Pierre Walthery']","We present findings from the first two waves of an innovative, population-representative, UK time-use diary survey conducted both pre- and mid-lockdown, using an online diary instrument that proved both reliable and quick-to-field. Combining diary information on activity, location, and co-presence to estimate infection risks associated with daily behavior, we show clear changes in such behavior related to infection risk between the pre- and mid-lockdown periods: a substantial reduction of time spent in those behaviors with the highest levels of risk, accompanied by an equivalent increase in low-risk behavior. Because, in general, a populations' time use changes relatively slowly, the behavioral changes revealed may be interpreted directly as a consequence of the UK COVID-19 'lockdown' regulations. Subsequent waves will reveal the behavioral consequences of future changes in regulation.",Article,0.0, SSRN Electronic Journal,Nov 20,0,"

Spectrometer was adopted to measure the emission spectrum of argon plasma jet at the ignitor exit, the boltzmann curve slope method was applied to calculate the jet electron temperature, and the ionization equilibrium equation was used to calculate jet temperature and to measure a law that length, electron temperature and jet temperature of ignitor exit jet length vary with arc current and flow rate. The experiment show that the arc current decreases as the inlet argon flow rate rises; the exit jet length increases first as the arc current rises and then decreases as the inlet argon flow rate rises; and the exit electron temperature and jet temperature increase with arc current and decrease with inlet argon flow rate rising. Moreover, whether the electron temperature could be used to replace jet temperature in aircraft plasma arc jet was discussed.",Article,0.0, Gaodianya Jishu/High Voltage Engineering,,0,"

"Income, ethnic diversity and family life in East London during the first wave of the pandemic: An assets approach","['Claire Cameron', ""Margaret O'Brien"", 'Lydia Whitaker[...]', 'Hanan Hauari']","Objective: This paper reports first results from a survey of 992 parents and parents to be living in an ethnically diverse and socio-economically unequal borough of East London during the coronavirus pandemic that reduced mobility, closed services and threatened public health. Background: Little is known about the place based impacts of the pandemic on families with young children. We describe the living circumstances of families with children under five or expecting a baby living in Tower Hamlets during the Coronavirus pandemic in 2020, and then examine the relative importance of household characteristics such as ethnicity and household income for adverse impacts on survey respondents, as seen in mental health outcomes. Method: a community survey sample recruited with support from the local council comprised 75% mothers/pregnant women, 25% fathers/partners of pregnant women. Reflecting the borough population, 35 percent were White British or Irish and 36 percent were Bangladeshi, and the remainder were from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. Adopting an assets based approach, we describe material, familial and community assets using three household income bands and seven ethnic groups. We then use regressions to identify which assets were most important in mitigating adversity. Results: We find that material assets (income, employment, food insecurity, housing quality) were often insecure and in decline but familial assets (home caring practices, couple relationships) were largely sustained. Community assets (informal support, service provision) were less available or means of access had changed. Our analyses find that while descriptively ethnicity structured adverse impacts of the pandemic related changes to family lif

Global stakeholder perspectives of home birth: a systematic scoping review,"['Ginny Brunton', 'Samira Wahab', 'Hassan Sheikh', 'Beth Murray-Davis']","Home birth is experienced by people very differently worldwide. These experiences likely differ by the type of stakeholder involved (women, their support persons, birth attendants, policy-makers), the experience itself (low-risk birth, transfer to hospital, previous deliveries), and by the health system within which home birth occurs (e.g., high-resource versus low- and middle-resource countries). Research evidence of stakeholders’ perspectives of home birth could usefully inform personal and policy decisions about choosing and providing home birth, but the current literature is fragmented and its breadth is not fully understood. We conducted a systematic scoping review to understand how the research literature on stakeholders’ perspectives of home birth is characterized in terms of populations, settings and identified issues, and what potential gaps exist in the research evidence. A range of electronic, web-based and key informant sources of evidence were searched. Located references were assessed, data extracted, and descriptively analyzed using robust methods. Our analysis included 460 full reports. Findings from 210 reports of studies in high-resource countries suggested that research with fathers and same-sex partners, midwives, and vulnerable populations and perspectives of freebirth and transfer to hospital could be synthesized. Gaps in primary research exist with respect to family members, policy makers, and those living in rural and remote locations. A further 250 reports of studies in low- and middle-resource countries suggested evidence for syntheses related to fathers and other family members, policy makers, and other health care providers and examination of issues related to emergency transfer t

Sexual Orientations and Identities Among Sexual Minority Emerging Adults: Marc E. D. Svensson and David M. FrostMarc E. D. Svensson and David M. Frost,"['Marc E. D. Svensson', 'David M Frost']","This chapter focuses on the development of sexual orientations and identities among sexual minority emerging adults, such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, pansexual, and other non-heterosexual sexual identities. The importance of sociohistorical context when examining sexual orientations and identity development is considered in explaining why emerging adults increasingly question binary constructs of both sexuality and gender, and more often adopt fluid and shifting identities, compared to older generations. New psychological frameworks accounting for these more diverse ways of approaching sexual identity and gender identity are reviewed. Nevertheless, health disparities among sexual minority emerging adults still prevail, and the minority stress framework is utilized to explain and understand the underlying reasons. The chapter concludes with suggestions on directions for future research on sexual orientations and identities in emerging adulthood.",Chapter,,,Nov 4,0,"

Ethnic and sexual identities: inequalities in adolescent health and wellbeing in a national population-based study,"['Amal Khanolkar', 'David M Frost', 'Victoria Redclift[...]', 'Evangeline Tabor']","Aims To examine inequalities related to dual sexual- and ethnic-identities in risk for health, wellbeing, and health-related behaviours in a nationally representative sample of adolescents. Methods 9,789 adolescents (51% female) aged 17 years from the UK-wide Millennium Cohort Study, with data on self-identified sexual- and ethnic-identities. Adolescents were grouped into White-Heterosexual, White sexual minority (White-SM), ethnic minority (EM)-heterosexual, and ethnic- and sexual minority (EM-SM). Mental health (e.g., self-reported psychological distress, doctor-diagnosed depression, attempted suicide, victimisation), general health (self-rated health, chronic illness, BMI) and a range of health-related behaviours (e.g., smoking, substance use) were assessed by questionnaires. Associations between dual identities and outcomes were analysed using logistic and linear regression (adjusted for sex and parental income). Results Sexual minorities (White:18% and ethnic minority:3%) had increased odds for mental ill-health and attempted suicide, with higher odds in White-SM than EM-SM. Compared to White-heterosexuals, White-SM and EM-SM had higher odds for psychological distress (OR 3.47/2.24 for White-SM/EM-SM respectively), and emotional problems (OR 3.17/1.65). White-SM and EM-SM had higher odds for attempted suicide (OR 2.78/2.02), self-harm (OR 3.06/1.52), and poor sleep quality (OR 1.88/1.67). In contrast, White-Heterosexual and White-SM groups had similarly high proportions reporting risky behaviours except for drug use (OR 1.34) and risky sex (OR 1.40) more common in White-SM individuals.

The complicated connection between closeness and the quality of romantic relationships,"['David M Frost', 'Allen J. LeBlanc']","Closeness is often considered synonymous with better quality romantic relationships. However, individual differences exist in the degree of closeness people desire in their relationships. This study examined the implications that discrepancies between actual and ideal closeness have for relationship quality in romantic couples. A questionnaire was administered to a sample of 103 cohabiting couples ( N = 206) in the United States, who were randomly selected from a nationally representative survey panel. Dyadic analysis using actor–partner interdependence models with latent outcomes revealed that internal discrepancies between actual and idealized closeness were associated with poorer relationship quality for both individuals and their partners. These associations persisted above and beyond the effects of actual closeness and dyad-level differences in actual and ideal closeness. The association between closeness and relationship quality may be more individual than dyadic in nature, warranting renewed attention to the idiographic experience of closeness and its association with relational well-being.",Article,1.0, Journal of Social and Personal Relationships,Nov 4,0,"

Well-being of children born after medically assisted reproductionKindeswohl nach medizinisch assistierter Reproduktion,"['Alice Goisis', 'Mikko Myrskylä']","Background The increasing number and proportion of children born after medically assisted reproduction (MAR) has raised concerns and motivated research about the impact of MAR on the well-being and development of children. Objective We summarize existing studies on the well-being and development of children conceived through MAR. Materials and methods Review of existing studies. Results Children conceived through MAR are at increased risk of adverse birth outcomes such as low birthweight and preterm delivery compared to naturally conceived children. The higher rates of multiple births amongst MAR-conceived children continue to represent an important driving factor behind these disparities. Reassuringly, elective single embryo transfer (eSET)—which is associated with more favourable pregnancy outcomes among MAR-conceived children—is becoming more common. Despite the early life health disadvantages, the evidence on later life outcomes such as physical, cognitive and psychosocial development is generally reassuring. On average, MAR-conceived children show similar or better outcomes than naturally conceived children. The selected and advantaged socioeconomic characteristics of parents who conceive through MAR are likely to play an important role in explaining why, on average, MAR-conceived children perform better than naturally conceived children—particularly in terms of cognitive outcomes. In contrast, there is some evidence pointing to potentially increased risks of mental health problems among MAR-conceived children. Conclusion There is need for continued monitoring and longer follow-up studies on the well-being of these children in order to better understand whether their outcomes ar

Sexual orientation and health behaviors among college students in Italy,"['Maria Sironi', 'Julie Fricke']","Studies regarding sexual orientation and health behaviors have largely neglected the Italian context. This research utilizes the second wave of the ‘Sexual and Emotional Life of Youths’ (SELFY) data set to compare the health behaviors of sexual minority (SM) and heterosexual college students in Italy. Results showed that bisexual women were more likely than heterosexual women to smoke both 1–7 and 8+ cigarettes per day, get drunk sometimes and often/very often, and use marijuana and/or ecstasy sometimes and often/very often. Homosexual women were more likely than heterosexual women to smoke 1–7 cigarettes per day, get drunk often/very often, and use marijuana and/or ecstasy often/very often. Homosexual men were more likely than heterosexual men to smoke 8+ cigarettes per day, but less likely to get drunk often/very often. Bisexual men were less likely than heterosexual men to participate in physical activity sometimes, often, and very often. Finally, bisexual men were less likely to exercise often than homosexual men. This work highlights that SM college students in Italy, particularly women, are more likely to engage in specific risky health behaviors compared to their heterosexual counterparts. More attention needs to be given to SMs in Italy to inform the Italian national health care system and to ensure that the appropriate care can be provided when required.",Article,1.0, Genus,Oct 21,1,"

Participatory research in and against time,['Rachel Rosen'],"The staccato rhythms of experiential time remain obscured in much of the literature on participatory research, where time is treated as a reassuring constant – a backdrop for human activity. This article addresses the discordances between lived temporalities and existing theorisations of participatory methodologies. It takes participatory research with lone child migrants as a particularly rich case to think with, given the proliferation of contradictory and often punitive applications of time these young people encounter in their interactions with migration and welfare regimes. The core argument developed is that unless temporality is given due theoretical and methodological attention, aims of contesting and unsettling inequities through participatory research will have limited success and can wind up reproducing exclusions and oppressions. In response to these critiques, the paper temporalizes participatory research through three reconstructions: working with and against time, de-centring shared time and collectivising the time of participatory research.",Article,1.0, Qualitative Research,Oct 18,0,"

Gender inequality in work-family balance,['Oriel Sullivan'],"Gender inequalities in work–family balance have wide-reaching ramifications: women shoulder the greatest burden of unpaid work and care, both decreasing their opportunities for employment and contributing significantly to the gender pay gap. Concerted measures at both the policy and ideological level are required to redress this problem. // Recent statistics show a gender pay gap of 16% in Europe1, and 18% in the USA2, despite half a century of women moving into paid employment. Gender inequality in pay is intricately linked to gender inequality in work–family balance, especially in the division of paid and unpaid work. Women shoulder the greatest burden of unpaid work and care, decreasing their opportunities for employment and career progression. The extent and cross-national scope of this inequality is a pressing matter on an international level, and it will require both innovative policy approaches and major shifts in attitudes to amend it.",Article,9.0, Nature Human Behaviour,Sep 30,0,"

Background: Few studies have investigated families headed by transgender individuals. Even less in contexts where there are no specific policies for family planning in this group, as is the case in Brazil. Methods: A hospital and web-based cross-sectional survey recruited transgender individuals from two Brazilian states, during July–October 2014 and January–March 2015. The survey was designed based on a cross-cultural adaptation of the TransPULSE project. Results: From 670 participants, 44 reported being parents, were older, stated more years of education and were more likely to be in a relationship, than the transgender adults who were not parents. Controlling for age, transgender parents reported suffering more discrimination than those who have no children. Among them, most became parents through biological means, 17.06% reported having lost or having the custody reduced for being transgender and 48.07% suspected or were told that their ability to see their children less was due to their gender identity. Implications: The findings of this study are relevant to guide the practice of individual, couple, and family therapists working with transgender clients.",Article,1.0, Family Relations,Sep 19,0,"

Using time-use diaries to track changing behavior across successive stages of COVID-19 social restrictions,"['Oriel Sullivan', 'Jonathan Gershuny', 'Almudena Sevilla[...]', 'Pierre Walthery']","How did people change their behavior over the different phases of the UK COVID-19 restrictions, and how did these changes affect their risk of being exposed to infection? Time-use diary surveys are unique in providing a complete chronicle of daily behavior: 24-h continuous records of the populations’ activities, their social context, and their location. We present results from four such surveys, collected in real time from representative UK samples, both before and at three points over the course of the current pandemic. Comparing across the four waves, we find evidence of substantial changes in the UK population’s behavior relating to activities, locations, and social context. We assign different levels of risk to combinations of activities, locations, and copresence to compare risk-related behavior across successive “lockdowns.” We find evidence that during the second lockdown (November 2020), there was an increase in high-risk behaviors relative to the first (starting March 2020). This increase is shown to be associated with more paid work time in the workplace. At a time when capacity is still limited both in respect of immunization and track–trace technology, governments must continue to rely on changes in people’s daily behaviors to contain the spread of COVID-19 and similar viruses. Time-use diary information of this type, collected in real time across the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, can provide policy makers with information to assess and quantify changes in daily behaviors and the impact they are likely to have on overall behavioral-associated risks.",Article,1.0, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,Aug 31,1,"

The effectiveness and suitability of interventions for social isolation and loneliness for older people from minoritised ethnic groups living in the UK,['Brenda Adongo Hayanga'],"This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and suitability of social isolation and loneliness interventions for older people from minoritised ethnic groups living in the UK. It employed an iterative mixed-methods approach, conducted in four phases. Using data from Understanding Society: the UK Household Longitudinal Study, Phase 1 explored ethnic variations in the friendship networks of older people using logistic regression analyses. Compared to older white people, older minoritised people’s friendship networks were found to be restricted in size and accessibility. These findings were explored further in Phase 2 using in-depth interviews with older people from minoritised ethnic groups. Community groups were identified as important for protecting against social isolation and loneliness. A mixed-methods systematic review was subsequently conducted to assess whether community-based group interventions reduced social isolation and loneliness in older people, and to uncover their underlying mechanisms. The evidence of effectiveness based on the meta-analyses was unclear, and qualitative comparative analysis was used to understand (non)effective interventions. The most effective interventions were found to adopt cognitive approaches to reducing loneliness, recruit participants with shared characteristics and provide participants with opportunities to connect. In Phase 4, the interviews conducted in Phase 2 were analysed using dialogic/performance analysis to gain an understanding of what older minoritised people consider their needs to be. The findings were used to assess the extent to which the interventions identified as most effective in Phase 3 matched what older people from minoritised ethnic g

Area-level and family-level socioeconomic position and body composition trajectories: longitudinal analysis of the UK Millennium Cohort Study,"['Charis Bridger Staatz', 'Yvonne Kelly', 'Rebecca E Lacey', 'Rebecca Hardy']","Background Inequalities in the trajectories of body composition in childhood and adolescence have been infrequently studied. Despite the importance of environmental factors in obesity development, little research has looked at area-level socioeconomic position, independent of family socioeconomic position. We aimed to assess how inequalities in body composition develop with age. Methods The Millennium Cohort Study is a longitudinal study of 19 243 families who had a child born between 2000 and 2002 in the UK. Multilevel growth curve models were applied to examine change in fat mass index (FMI), fat free mass index (FFMI; using the Benn index), and fat mass to fat free mass ratio (FM:FFM), measured using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis, from ages 7 years to 17 years by the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) and household income at baseline. Findings Inequalities in FMI and FM:FFM ratio are evident at age 7 years and widen with age. At age 17 years, adolescents in the most disadvantaged IMD group had FMI 0·57 kg/mB (B=Benn parameter; 95% CI 0·43 to 0·70) higher and FM:FFM ratio 0·037 (95% CI 0·026 to 0·047) higher compared with the most advantaged group. Disadvantaged socioeconomic position is associated with higher FFMI but is reversed in adolescence after adjustment for FMI. Inequalities were greater in girls at age 7 years (mean FMI 0·22 kg/mB; 95% CI 0·13 to 0·32) compared with boys of the same age (0·05 kg/mB; –0·04 to 0·15, p=0·3), but widen fastest in boys, especially for FMI, in which there was over an 11 times increase in the inequality from age 7 years of 0·05kg/mB (95% CI –0·04 to 0·15) to 0·62 kg/mB at 17 years (0·42 to 0·82).

Socioeconomic position and body composition in childhood in high- and middle-income countries: a systematic review and narrative synthesis,"['Charis Bridger Staatz', 'Yvonne Kelly', 'Rebecca E Lacey[...]', 'Rebecca Hardy']","Background The relation between socioeconomic position (SEP) and obesity measured by body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight for height, has been extensively reviewed in children, showing consistent associations between disadvantaged SEP and higher BMI in high-income countries (HICs) and lower BMI in middle-income countries (MICs). Fat mass (FM), a more accurate measure of adiposity, and fat-free mass (FFM) are not captured by BMI, but have been shown to track from childhood to adulthood, and be important for cardiovascular health and functional outcomes in later life. It is not clear whether body composition is associated with SEP. We systematically reviewed the association between SEP and body composition in childhood. Methods A systematic review was carried out following PRISMA guidelines. The protocol was pre-registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019119937). Original studies in the English language, which examined the association between SEP and body composition in childhood, were included. An electronic search of three databases was conducted. Two independent reviewers carried out screening, data extraction and quality assessment. Due to heterogeneity in results, a narrative synthesis was conducted. Heterogeneity in findings according to SEP, sex, body composition measure and country income level was investigated. Results 50 papers were included, the majority from HICs. No papers were from low-income countries. Disadvantage in childhood was associated with greater FM and lower FFM in HICs, but with lower FM and lower FFM in MICs.

Life course socioeconomic position and body composition in adulthood: a systematic review and narrative synthesis,"['Charis Bridger Staatz', 'Yvonne Kelly', 'Rebecca E Lacey[...]', 'Rebecca Hardy']","Multiple systematic reviews have investigated the relation between socioeconomic position (SEP) and body mass index (BMI) throughout the life course. However, BMI does not capture quantity and distribution of fat and muscle, which are better indicators of obesity than BMI, and have been independently linked to adverse health outcomes. Less is known about the relation between SEP and body composition, and the literature has not been reviewed. We therefore systematically reviewed the literature on the association between life course SEP and body composition in adulthood. A protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42019119937), and the review followed PRISMA guidelines. An electronic search of three databases (MEDLINE, Embase Classic + Embase and SPORTDiscus) was conducted. Original studies in the English language were included that examine the association between any recognised measure of SEP at any age and body composition (fat mass, fat-free mass, ratio and distribution) in adulthood, measured using a direct technique, i.e., not an anthropometric measure. A narrative synthesis was conducted. A total of 47 papers were included in the final review, none were from low-income countries (LICs). Greater advantage in childhood and adulthood was associated with lower fat levels in high-income countries (HICs). Associations in the opposite direction were found exclusively in middle-income countries (MICs). No studies in MICs reported associations for childhood SEP. For measures of lean mass, the majority of papers reported no association, or greater advantage in adulthood associated with higher lean mass, with little variation between HICs and MICs.

We analysed symptom duration and risk factor from 10 longitudinal study (LS) samples and electronic healthcare records (EHR). Methods Samples: 6907 adults self-reporting COVID-19 infection from 48,901 participants in the UK LS, and 3,327 adults with COVID-19, were assigned a long COVID code from 1,199,812 individuals in primary care EHR. Outcomes for LS included symptom duration lasting 4+ weeks (long COVID) and 12+ weeks. Association with of age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, smoking, general and mental health, overweight/obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and asthma was assessed. Results In LS, symptoms impacted normal functioning for 12+ weeks in 1.2% (mean age 20 years) to 4.8% (mean age 63 y) of COVID-19 cases. Between 7.8% (mean age 28 y) and 17% (mean age 58 y) reported any symptoms for 12+ weeks, and greater proportions for 4+ weeks. Age was associated with a linear increased risk in long COVID between 20 and 70 years. Being female (LS: OR=1.49; 95%CI:1.24-1.79; EHR: OR=1.51 [1.41-1.61]), having poor pre-pandemic mental health (LS: OR=1.46 [1.17-1.83]; EHR: OR=1.57 [1.47-1.68]) and poor general health (LS: OR=1.62 [1.25-2.09]; EHR: OR=1.26; [1.18-1.35]) were associated with higher risk of long COVID.

Mental Health Around the Transition to First Birth: Does Medically Assisted Reproduction Matter?,"['Marco Tosi', 'Alice Goisis']","Previous research has shown that childbearing is associated with short-term improvements in women's subjective well-being but that these effects depend on the timing and quantum of the birth as well as on the parents' education and socioeconomic status. These studies did not address whether and, if so, how this effect varies according to the mode of conception. This represents an important knowledge gap, given that conceptions through medically assisted reproduction (MAR) have been increasing rapidly in recent decades, exceeding 5% of live births in some European countries. Drawing on nine waves (2009/2010–2017/2018) of the UK Household Longitudinal Study, we use distributed fixed-effects linear regression models to examine changes in women's mental health before, during, and after natural and MAR conceptions. The results show that the mental health of women who conceived naturally improved around the time of conception and then gradually returned to baseline levels; comparatively, the mental health of women who conceived through MAR declined in the year before pregnancy and then gradually recovered. The findings also indicate that women's happiness decreased both two years and one year before an MAR conception and then increased above the baseline in the year of pregnancy. We further show that the deterioration in mental health and subjective well-being before an MAR conception affects both partners, which could be part of a longer process in which the partners potentially suffer from stress related not solely to the MAR treatments themselves but also to the experience of subfertility.",Article,1.0, Demography,May 31,0,"

Call for papers: LGBTI+ population and healthcare context,"['Paolo Valerio', 'Cristiano Scandurra', 'David M. Frost']","Although research on the health of LGBTI+ populations is expanding rapidly, including a focus on social and health policies, the experiences of LGBTI+ people within healthcare contexts needs to be explored in even more in detail. An increasing body of research has demonstrated that LGBTI+ people face health inequalities, which are due to the pernicious effects of social stigma. A more accurate understanding of the quality of care received and perceived by this population represents a fundamental social issue and a central focus for reducing health inequalities. Indeed, many LGBTI+ people still avoid healthcare contexts for fear of discrimination from healthcare providers. On the other hand, many healthcare providers still have little knowledge about the specific health needs of this population. A further issue concerns the structural/institutional stigma embedded within some health organizations due to the existence of laws and regulations that not guarantee full equality for LGBTI+ populations. The focus of this thematic issue is the experience of LGBTI+ people within healthcare contexts. We invite contributions from a plurality of theoretical and methodological perspectives, including but not limited to: clinical and social psychology, sociology, philosophy, jurisprudence, diversity management, organization and HR management. Qualitative, quantitative and/or mixed-method design are welcome, as well as reviews and critical reflections.

Precarious Care and (Dis)Connections: Adults Working With Separated Child Migrants in England and Their Understandings of Care,"['Sarah Crafter', 'Rachel Rosen', 'Veena Meetoo']","Adult stakeholders who work with separated child migrants (SCMs) face a substantial challenge to their capacity or remit to care amid increasingly hostile immigration environments. This paper explores a diverse range of adult stakeholders' understandings of the care of SCMs, filling an important gap in understanding how care is conceptualized by those working in often complex and contradictory positions. Drawing on the care literature, this study focuses on 15 qualitative semistructured interviews with state and nonstate adult stakeholders in England (e.g., social work, law, police, and NGO workers). We argue that stringent immigration practices, policies, and bureaucratic and structural challenges undoubtedly present personal tensions and professional constraints for those whose role is meant to foreground “care.” Importantly, when taking into account a range of different perspectives, roles, and responsibilities across professions and sectors, our respondents were constrained in varying ways or had varying room to maneuver within their institutional contexts. Our analysis suggests that amid a hostile immigration environment, care connections with and between SCMs are treated with mistrust and are unstable over space and time. We argue that how care is conceptualized and experienced is mutually constituted by hostile policies and procedures, adult stakeholders' roles within or out-with those systems, and their personal values and perspectives. It is within this space where constraints, enablers, and resistances play out. Care is subjectively experienced, and care relationships are open to potential (dis)connection across space and time.",Article,1.0, International Perspectives in Psychology Research Practice Consultation,May 2,0,"

"Rapid systematic review of systematic reviews: what befriending, social support and low intensity psychosocial interventions, delivered remotely, may reduce social isolation and loneliness among older adults and how?","['Elisabeth Boulton', 'Dylan Kneale', 'Claire Stansfield[...]', 'Chris James Todd']","Background : During the COVID-19 pandemic ‘social distancing’ has highlighted the need to minimise loneliness and isolation among older adults (aged 50+). We wanted to know what remotely delivered befriending, social support and low intensity psychosocial interventions may help to alleviate social isolation and loneliness and how they work. Methods : We followed a systematic ‘review of reviews’ approach. Searches of 11 databases from the fields of health, social care, psychology and social science were undertaken during April 2020. Reviews meeting our PICOS criteria were included if they focussed on the evaluation of remote interventions to reduce levels of social isolation or loneliness in adults aged 50+ and were critically appraised using AMSTAR2. Narrative synthesis was used at a review and study level to develop a typology of intervention types and their effectiveness. Intervention Component Analysis (ICA) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) were used at a study level to explore the characteristics of successful interventions. Results : We synthesised evidence from five systematic reviews and 18 primary studies. Remote befriending, social support and low intensity psychosocial interventions took the form of: (i) supported video-communication; (ii) online discussion groups and forums; (iii) telephone befriending; (iv) social networking sites; and (v) multi-tool interventions. The majority of studies utilised the first two approaches, and were generally regarded positively by older adults, although with mixed evidence around effectiveness. Focussing on processes and mechanisms, using ICA and QCA, we found that the interventions that were most successful in improving social support: (i) e

Governing Researchers through Public Involvement,"['Aris Komporozos-Athanasiou', 'JONATHAN PAYLOR', 'Christopher Mckevitt']","This paper focuses on recent developments in UK health research policy, which place new pressures on researchers to address issues of accountability and impact through the implementation of patient and public involvement (PPI). We draw on an in-depth interview study with 20 professional researchers, and we analyse their experiences of competing for research funding, focusing on PPI as a process of professional research governance. We unearth dominant professional narratives of scepticism and alternative identifications in their enactment of PPI policy. We argue that such narratives and identifications evidence a resistance to ways in which patient involvement has been institutionalised and to the resulting subject-positions researchers are summoned to take up. We show that the new subjectivities emerging in this landscape of research governance as increasingly disempowered, contradictory and fraught with unresolved tensions over the ethical dimensions of the researchers’ own professional identities.",Article,1.0, Journal of Social Policy,Apr 28,0,"

"“It’s being a part of a grand tradition, a grand counter-culture which involves communities”: A qualitative investigation of autistic community connectedness.","['Monique Botha', 'Bridget Dibb', 'David M Frost']","Autistic people report greater comfort socialising and easier communication with each other. Despite autism being stereotypically associated with lack of social motivation, an autistic community has been described briefly in the literature but is not well understood. Autistic community connectedness (ACC) may play a role in promoting wellbeing for autistic people. This qualitative study involved interviewing autistic individuals (N = 20) in-person, via a video-based platform, a text-based platform, or over email to investigate ACC. Critical grounded theory tools were used to collect and analyse the data. There were three elements of ACC: belongingness, social connectedness, and political connectedness. Belongingness referred to the sense of similarity that autistic people experienced with each other. Social connectedness referred to specific friendship participants formed with other autistic people. Political connectedness referred to a connectedness to the political or social equality goals of the autistic community. Participants described the benefits of ACC as being increased self-esteem, a sense of direction, and a sense of community not experienced elsewhere. Lack of connectedness involved ambivalence with an autism identity and/or feelings of internalised stigma. Experiences of ACC may have implications for autistic people’s wellbeing, as well as how they cope with minority stress.",Preprint,,,Apr 26,0,"

Previous studies report health care professionals’ (HCPs) assessment of various parent-related factors as barriers to referral. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of HCPs working in a paediatric tertiary care hospital in the United Kingdom, with an established paediatric palliative care team, to explore staff perceptions of barriers, knowledge and attitudes, with the aim of developing interventions to increase patient access to palliative care services. Survey respondents evidenced good knowledge of the principles of palliative care in closed questions, but their attitudes expressed in open-text questions and reported reasons to refer to a palliative care service demonstrated an association of palliative care with death and dying. We suggest that the association of palliative care with end of life may be a modifiable factor relevant to late and non-referral and deserving of further investigation and attention in education and training.",Article,,,,1,"

‘She has mellowed me into the idea of SPL’: unpacking relational resources in UK couples’ discussions of Shared Parental Leave take-up,['Katherine Twamley'],"This article undertakes an in-depth examination into how two couples negotiate the sharing of parental leave, to understand how ‘relational resources’ may be drawn on in transforming gendered practices. The couples are selected from a longitudinal study of 42 first-time parents taking various combinations of leave. Drawing on a ‘listening guide’ approach, I analyse the interactions observed in couple interviews with a couple that shares, and another couple that does not share leave. I show that in trying to convince their partners to take leave, both women draw on gendered scripts, either in how the interaction is managed, or by the discourses that are drawn on. Moreover, fathers’ work context strongly mediates negotiations, as all participants judge this to trump other considerations regarding leave, reinforcing men’s attachment to the workplace. More research is needed to understand how these process shape divisions of paid and unpaid work in the long term.",Article,0.0, Families Relationships and Societies,,0,"

Computational Simulation Is a Vital Resource for Navigating the COVID-19 Pandemic,"['Andrew Page', 'Saikou Y. Diallo', 'Wesley J. Wildman[...]', 'David Voas']","Introduction: COVID-19 has prompted the extensive use of computational models to understand the trajectory of the pandemic. This article surveys the kinds of dynamic simulation models that have been used as decision support tools and to forecast the potential impacts of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). We developed the Values in Viral Dispersion model, which emphasizes the role of human factors and social networks in viral spread and presents scenarios to guide policy responses. Methods: An agent-based model of COVID-19 was developed with individual agents able to move between 3 states (susceptible, infectious, or recovered), with each agent placed in 1 of 7 social network types and assigned a propensity to comply with NPIs (quarantine, contact tracing, and physical distancing). A series of policy questions were tested to illustrate the impact of social networks and NPI compliance on viral spread among (1) populations, (2) specific at-risk subgroups, and (3) individual trajectories. Results: Simulation outcomes showed large impacts of physical distancing policies on number of infections, with substantial modification by type of social network and level of compliance. In addition, outcomes on metrics that sought to maximize those never infected (or recovered) and minimize infections and deaths showed significantly different epidemic trajectories by social network type and among higher or lower at-risk age cohorts. Conclusions: Although dynamic simulation models have important limitations, which are discussed, these decision support tools should be a key resource for navigating the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and can help local and national decision makers determine where, when, and how to invest resources.",Article,1.0, Simulation in healthcare: journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare,Apr 7,0,"

Introduction: Reimagining Migrant Generations,"['Mette Berg', 'Susan Eckstein']","We live in an era of globalization involving large-scale international migration and increasing transnational connectedness that have contributed to the emergence and growth of diaspora communities. In this context, questions of how diaspora migrants adapt to host societies and engage with their homelands are becoming increasingly important economically, politically, socially, and culturally—to diasporic groups themselves, to their homelands, and to the countries where they settle. Yet little is known about internal diversity and stratification within individual diasporas. Our understanding of how pre-migration experiences shape migrants’ adaptation where they resettle and their homeland involvements, as well as their relations to other diaspora members settled elsewhere, remains especially inadequate. This Introduction and the special issue more generally advance the understanding of diasporas and their internal diversity, analytically and descriptively, through a historically grounded conceptual generational frame.",Article,5.0, Diaspora A Journal of Transnational Studies,Apr 2,0,"

Cubans in the United States and Spain: The Diaspora Generational Divide,"['Susan Eckstein', 'Mette Berg']","For decades the Miami-based Cuban diaspora successfully represented itself globally as a monolithic bloc and influenced US policy vis-a-vis Cuba. Yet the success glosses over the diversity of the Cuban diaspora, not only in Miami, but in the United States more widely, as well as internationally. The first wave of emigres, who are known as “exiles, “ have for decades campaigned for a watertight embargo against Cuba and have on principle refused to visit their homeland. By contrast, more recent Cuban emigres, who have left the island since the economic crisis of the 1990s and who are less affluent and have less political clout, have forged cross-border transnational links with kin and friends on the island. In this article, building on Mannheim’s thesis about the long-lasting impact that early-life experiences may have, we show that diasporic Cubans who left Cuba with shared experiences and then settled in the United States or Spain adapted similarly, and relate to Cuba in similar ways, and differently from Cubans who emigrated at other points in time with different pre-migration lived experiences. Specifically, we compare and contrast two historically grounded generations in the United States and in Spain in terms of labor market insertion, political incorporation, and linguistic and cultural acculturation in the two host countries. We thereby illustrate the explanatory power of our historically grounded thesis of diasporic generation formations that we elucidated in the Introduction. The article shows how historically grounded pre-migration experiences continue to shape and mold the ways in which immigrants relate to their homeland from abroad, in ways that neither the assimilationist nor the transnational framework can account for.

Early life mental health and problematic drinking in mid-adulthood: evidence from two British birth cohorts,"['Ke Ning', 'Praveetha Patalay', 'Jennifer L Maggs', 'George B. Ploubidis']","Purpose Accumulating evidence suggests that externalising problems are consistently associated with alcohol use behaviours, but findings are inconsistent regarding the role of internalising problems. We investigate whether externalising and internalising problems are associated with problematic drinking in mid-adulthood, and whether potential associations are modified by age, sex and cohort. Methods The National Child Development Study (NCDS58, n = 17,633) and 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70, n = 17,568) recruited new-borns in Great Britain in a single week in 1958 and 1970. Mental health was assessed with the Rutter Behaviour Questionnaire at ages 7, 11, and 16 in NCDS58 and ages 5, 10 and 16 in BCS70. Problematic drinking was measured with the CAGE questionnaire at age 33 in NCDS58 and age 34 in BCS70, and the AUDIT scale at age 44/45 in NCDS58 and age 46 in BCS70. Latent scores of externalising and internalising problems were added chronologically into lagged logistic regression models. Results Externalising and internalising problems were associated in opposite directions with problematic drinking in mid-adulthood. Externalising was a risk factor (OR [95% CI] ranging from 1.06 [1.03, 1.10] to 1.11 [1.07, 1.15] for different ages), and internalising was a protective factor (OR [95% CI] ranging from 0.95 [0.92, 0.99] to 0.90 [0.86, 0.94] for different ages). Associations between early life mental health and mid-adulthood problematic drinking did not differ by developmental timing but were stronger in males. Conclusion Our study provides new insights on links of externalising and internalising difficulties with alcohol use and has implications for public policy in the UK.",Article,1.0, Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology,Mar 28,1,"

Engaging Community: Undergraduate student involvement in research as participatory method,"['Kate Luxion', 'M Svensson', 'D Frost']","Within the context of low-resource projects, both limited on time and resources, it can be difficult to incorporate equitable research methods, such as community-based participatory research. For LBGTQ+ research, there are similar barriers, with the need for health research projects that support community-led projects and centre LGBTQ+ voices through their methods. This presentation frames research methods as a social justice issue, addressing the value of community members as academic researchers; it seeks to highlight additional ways in which community involvement increases trust in both research processes and outcomes. The included examples are sub-projects and methods that are part of two distinct LGBTQ+/community-led PhD projects using either a multi-study or mixed methods approach; as such the discussion is focused on their use of qualitative methods. Coming from a social psychology perspective, themes are related to plurisexual emerging adults’ parenthood desires and plans and a biomedical study on LGBTQ+ pregnancy and parenthood, with recommendations that are transferable to other health topics. Focusing on the primary example, the presentation discusses the benefits of engaging LGBTQ+ community members assist on data processing and meaning-making while building qualitative research skills. A case study based on this postgraduate-undergraduate mentoring scheme, proposes a purposeful approach to encouraging community-led research as part of capacity building efforts for undergraduates, within and beyond academia. Information to be covered, in addition to the case study, includes how participant trust was fostered through protocols, methods, and the analysis process - with further examples pending.",Conference Paper,1.0, BMJ Open,Mar 23,0,"

Global stakeholder perspectives of home birth: a systematic scoping review.,"['Ginny Brunton', 'Samira Wahab', 'Hassan Sheikh', 'Beth Murray-Davis']","Home birth is experienced by people very differently worldwide. These experiences likely differ by the type of stakeholder involved (women, their support persons, birth attendants, policy-makers), the experience itself (low-risk birth, transfer to hospital, previous deliveries), and by the health system within which home birth occurs (e.g. high-resource versus low- and middle-resource countries). Research evidence of stakeholders’ perspectives of home birth could usefully inform personal and policy decisions about choosing and providing home birth, but the current literature is fragmented and its breadth is not fully understood. We conducted a systematic scoping review to understand how the research literature on stakeholders’ perspectives of home birth is characterized in terms of populations, settings and identified issues, and what potential gaps exist in the research evidence. A range of electronic, web-based and key informant sources of evidence were searched. Located references were assessed, data extracted and analysed using robust methods. Our analysis included 387 full reports. Findings from 181 reports of studies in high-resource countries suggested that research with fathers, midwives and vulnerable populations and perspectives of freebirth and transfer to hospital could be synthesized, but gaps in primary research exist with respect to family members, policy makers, and those living in rural and remote locations. A further 206 reports of studies in low- and middle-resource countries suggested evidence for syntheses related to fathers and other family members, policy makers and other health care providers, and examination of issues related to emergency transfer to hospital, rural and remote home b

The cognitive development from childhood to adolescence of low birth weight children born after medical assisted reproduction – a UK longitudinal cohort study,"['Marco Cozzani', 'Siddartha Aradhya', 'Alice Goisis']","Background Previous research has documented that children conceived through medically assisted reproduction (MAR) are at increased risk of poor birth outcomes, such as low birthweight (LBW), which are risk factors for stunted longer-term cognitive development. However, parents who undergo MAR to conceive have, on average, advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds which could compensate for the negative effects of being born LBW. Previous studies have not analysed whether the negative effects of LBW are attenuated among MAR conceived children. Methods We draw on the UK Millennium Cohort Study (sweeps 1–6) which contains a sub-sample of (N = 396) MAR-conceived children. The dependent variable measures cognitive ability at around ages 3, 5, 7, 11 and 14. We examine the cognitive development of four groups of children: MAR-conceived low birthweight (MAR LBW); MAR-conceived non-low birthweight (MAR NLBW); naturally conceived low birthweight (NC LBW); naturally conceived non-low birthweight (NC NLBW). We estimate the two following linear regression models for each sweep: (i) a baseline model to examine the unadjusted association between cognitive development and low birthweight by mode of conception; and (ii) a model adjusted by socio-demographic family characteristics. Results In baseline models, MAR LBW children [age 3: β = 0.021, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.198, 0.241; age 5: β = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.009, 0.418; age 7: β = 0.163, 95% CI: -0.148, 0.474; age 11: β = 0.003, 95% CI: -0.318, 0.325; age 14: β = 0.156, 95% CI: -0.205, 0.517], on average perform similarly in cognitive ability relative to NC NLBW at all ages, and display higher cognitive scores than NC LBW children until a

Feasibility study of hospital antimicrobial stewardship analytics using electronic health records,"['P F Dutey-Magni', 'M J Gill', 'David McNulty[...]', 'Chris Fuller']","Background Hospital antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes are multidisciplinary initiatives to optimize antimicrobial use. Most hospitals depend on time-consuming manual audits to monitor clinicians’ prescribing. But much of the information needed could be sourced from electronic health records (EHRs). Objectives To develop an informatics methodology to analyse characteristics of hospital AMS practice using routine electronic prescribing and laboratory records. Methods Feasibility study using electronic prescribing, laboratory and clinical coding records from adult patients admitted to six specialities at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK (September 2017–August 2018). The study involved: (i) a review of AMS standards of care; (ii) their translation into concepts measurable from commonly available EHRs; and (iii) a pilot application in an EHR cohort study (n = 61679 admissions). Results We developed data modelling methods to characterize antimicrobial use (antimicrobial therapy episode linkage methods, therapy table, therapy changes). Prescriptions were linked into antimicrobial therapy episodes (mean 2.4 prescriptions/episode; mean length of therapy 5.8 days), enabling several actionable findings. For example, 22% of therapy episodes for low-severity community-acquired pneumonia were congruent with prescribing guidelines, with a tendency to use broader-spectrum antibiotics. Analysis of therapy changes revealed IV to oral therapy switching was delayed by an average 3.6 days (95% CI: 3.4–3.7).

Hammack[...]', 'Bianca D.M. Wilson']","During the past 50 years, there have been marked improvement in the social and legal environment of sexual minorities in the United States. Minority stress theory predicts that health of sexual minorities is predicated on the social environment. As the social environment improves, exposure to stress would decline and health outcomes would improve. We assessed how stress, identity, connectedness with the LGBT community, and psychological distress and suicide behavior varied across three distinct cohorts of sexual minority people in the United States. Using a national probability sample recruited in 2016 and 2017, we assessed three a priori defined cohorts of sexual minorities we labeled the pride (born 1956-1963), visibility (born 1974-1981), and equality (born 1990-1997) cohorts. We found significant and impressive cohort differences in coming out milestones, with members of the younger cohort coming out much earlier than members of the two older cohorts. But we found no signs that the improved social environment attenuated their exposure to minority stressors-both distal stressors, such as violence and discrimination, and proximal stressors, such as internalized homophobia and expectations of rejection. Psychological distress and suicide behavior also were not improved, and indeed were worse for the younger than the older cohorts. These findings suggest that changes in the social environment had limited impact on stress processes and mental health for sexual minority people. They speak to the endurance of cultural ideologies such as homophobia and heterosexism and accompanying rejection of and violence toward sexual minorities.",Article,1.0, PLoS ONE,Mar 6,1,"

"The Dawkins effect? Celebrity scientists, (non)religious publics and changed attitudes to evolution","['Amy Unsworth', 'David Voas']","The role of science popularization remains relatively under-explored in research on contemporary public acceptance of evolution. In this study, we analyse national survey data to interrogate the role Britain’s best-known celebrity scientists David Attenborough, Brian Cox, Richard Dawkins and Stephen Hawking may have played in changing public views of evolution, as well as the role of two creationists: Ken Ham and Harun Yahya. We investigate how well known these public figures are, what their views of religion are perceived to be and, drawing on social identity theory, whether they exert different effects on attitudinal change to evolution among different religious and non-religious publics. Binary logistic regression analysis shows that among Muslim and Pentecostal Christian publics, those familiar with Dawkins as both a scientist and as someone who holds negative views of religion are more likely to have become less accepting of evolution. Conversely, among non-religious publics, Dawkins was the only celebrity scientist associated with higher odds of becoming more accepting of evolution. We suggest that engaging certain religious audiences with the science of evolutionary biology may be more effective when their religious identities are not threatened.",Article,1.0, Public Understanding of Science,Feb 28,1,"

Evidence about the impact of air pollution on cognitive development of children has been growing but remains inconclusive. Objectives. To investigate the association of air pollution exposure and the cognitive development of children in the UK Millennium Cohort Study. Methods. Longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of 13,058-14,614 singleton births, 2000-2002, analysed at age 3, 5 and 7 years for associations between exposure from birth to selected air pollutants and cognitive scores for: School Readiness, Naming Vocabulary (age 3 and 5), Picture Similarity, Pattern Construction (age 5 and 7), Number Skills and Word Reading. Multivariable regression models took account of design stratum, clustering and sampling and attrition weights with adjustment for major risk factors, including age, gender, ethnicity, region, household income, parents' education, language, siblings and second-hand tobacco smoke. Results: In fully adjusted models, no associations were observed between pollutant exposures and cognitive scores at age 3. At age 5, particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) were associated with lower scores for Naming Vocabulary but no other outcome except for SO2 and Picture Similarity. At age 7, PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 were associated with lower scores for Pattern Construction, SO2 with lower Number Skills and SO2 and ozone with poorer Word Reading scores, but PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 were associated with higher Word Reading scores.

Sexual health promotion and contraceptive services in local authorities: a systematic review of economic evaluations 2010-2015,"['Ginny Brunton', 'Christine Michaels-Igbokwe', 'A Santos[...]', 'James Thomas']","Background Since 2013, health commissioners in England’s local authorities have been responsible for sexual health services, including contraception, HIV testing, STI testing and treatment, health education and specialist sexual health services. Effective commissioning requires information to indicate which interventions may, or may not, be cost-effective. However, current UK guidance and recent research on the cost-effectiveness of sexual health services provides patchy and fragmented evidence. This study aims systematically to review the evidence available on the cost-effectiveness of OECD-based interventions relevant to UK local authority-commissioned sexual health services. Methods Key informants, bibliographic database searches and reference lists of guidance documents and included studies were searched for potentially relevant research. Guided by key stakeholders, we sought economic evaluations of sexual health interventions within the responsibility of local authorities, and focused in the UK, on contraception and on health promotion, published between 2010 and 2015 in English. Eligible studies were full economic evaluations based in an OECD country. Studies were classified using a specifically developed tool and assessed for methodological risk of bias using one of three design-specific assessment tools. Descriptive frequencies of codes were analysed to provide a ‘map’ of research that informed stakeholder discussions to focus the subsequent synthesis.

Combining diary information on activity, location, and co-presence to estimate infection risks associated with daily behavior, we show clear changes in risk-associated behavior between the pre, full-lockdown and post full-lockdown periods. We document a shift from more to less risky daily behavior patterns (combinations of activity/location/co-presence categories) between the pre-pandemic pattern and full lockdown in May/June 2020, followed by a reversion (although not a complete reversal) of those patterns in August 2020 following the end of the first lockdown.

Following Sen’s definition of Development as Freedom (Sen 1999), economic empowerment is an essential capability to live the life one has reason to value and can therefore be seen as an outcome of development in its own right. Gender empowerment is also one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and four of the nine targets of this goal relate directly to women’s economic empowerment (UN 2015). As a mechanism for development, there is strong longitudinal evidence that increased inclusion and participation of women in the labour market supports economic growth and development (World Bank 2012; IGC 2015; Kabeer 2012). Full participation of women in labour forces for example is estimated to add multiple percentage points to most national economic growth rates, thus increasing aggregate socio-economic development (UN 2015). Similarly, the McKinsey Global Institute estimates that if all women were able to participate fully in the economy, it would contribute up to US$ 28 trillion or 26 percent of annual global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025 (McKinsey Global Institute 2015). The potential benefits of women’s participation in the labour market underlines that the economic empowerment of women is by no means a zero-sum game: society as a whole stands to gain from it. Investing in women’s economic empowerment is smart economics (Revenga & Shetty 2012). Increasing women’s income leads to greater household spending on education and health (World Bank 2012). It also increases women’s self-esteem, aspirations, and domestic bargaining powers while reducing do

Using time use diaries to track changing behavior across successive stages of COVID-19 social restrictions,"['Jonathan Gershuny', 'Oriel Sullivan', 'Almudena Sevilla[...]', 'Pierre Walthery']","We present analyses of 24-hour time use diary records of the UK population’s activities, their social context and their location, collected in real time from four successive waves of representative UK samples, both before, and during, the current COVID-19 pandemic. We show changes in behavioral response to social restrictions at three time-points during the pandemic, including across two nationwide lockdowns. Comparing samples across the four waves, we find evidence of substantial changes in the population’s activities, locations and social interactions, which may be interpreted as direct responses to changes in regulations. One of our main motivations was to compare risk-related behavior across the first and second lockdowns. We find suggestive evidence that the second lockdown (recorded late November 2020) was less strictly adhered to than the first (recorded May- June 2020). Holding constant gender, age and social grade, the population spent on average 32 more minutes per day in high risk activities in late November 2020 than in first lockdown. Disaggregating by gender and age group, the difference was found to be statistically significant for all groups, with the exception of those aged 55 and over. Significance statement What do people do during lockdown? This set of data is unique in providing time use diary information in real time on changing behavior in the UK in response to each major change in social restrictions. This enables us to directly compare 24-hour continuous and comprehensive information on the populations’ activities, their social context and their location, comparing risk- related behavior during different phases of social restrictions.

STRONG FOUNDATIONS AND EMERGING THEMES,"['Priscilla Alderson', 'Virginia Morrow']","For researchers engaged with ethical research involving children, Priscilla Alderson and Virginia Morrow need no introduction. Their Handbook has shaped so much of what we know about ethical research involving children. Priscilla and Virginia have just released the fourth version of the Handbook (Sage 2nd edition) and we are privileged to have the opportunity to discuss this with them for this month's Expert Blog. What do you think are the challenges for research ethics today? Priscilla: I wrote the first version of the Handbook in 1995, after I'd worked with medical ethics since 1981. Doctors were taking research ethics very seriously, but many social researchers ignored ethics, or at least ignored formal review systems. During the early 2000s, I was pleased to see social research ethics and formal reviews being taken far more seriously. They continue to keep up vital high standards. But after the 'rise' in ethical awareness, we think there has partly been a 'fall'. We have written in the 2020 Handbook about the dangers of over-bureaucratic review systems that can waste months of precious research time and funding. Bureaucracy seems to be taking over many areas of our lives, but I think national and international surveys are urgently needed to uncover the extent of delays and costs as well as the gains. We know of researchers who are grateful when ethics reviews committees are helpful, supportive and raise important new questions for researchers to address. Yet there needs to be more united work among reviewers and researchers to simplify the review systems. Are there any new features in the fourth version of the Handbook?

"Stigmatization of ‘gay‐sounding’ voices: The role of heterosexual, lesbian, and gay individuals’ essentialist beliefs","['Fabio Fasoli', 'Peter Hegarty', 'David M Frost']","Voice‐based sexual orientation (SO) judgements can prompt group‐based discrimination. However, the relationships between stigmatization and essentialist beliefs about vocal cues to SO have not been researched. Two studies examined heterosexuals’ and gay men’s and lesbian women’s essentialist beliefs about voice as a cue of SO to uncover essentialist beliefs’ role in the perpetration and experience of stigma. In Study 1 (N = 363), heterosexual participants believed voice was a better cue to SO for men than for women, and participants’ belief in the discreteness, immutability, and controllability of ‘gay‐sounding’ voices was correlated with higher avoidant discrimination towards gay‐sounding men. In Study 2 (N = 147), endorsement of essentialist beliefs about voice as a SO cue was associated with self‐perceptions of sounding gay amongst gay men and lesbians. Sexual minority participants, especially gay men, who believed that they sounded gay reported more anticipation of rejection and engaged in vigilance in response. Essentialist beliefs about vocal cues to SO are relevant to explaining both the perpetration of stigma by heterosexuals and the experience of stigma for lesbians and gay men.",Article,1.0, British Journal of Social Psychology,Jan 23,1,"

Family Belongingness Attenuates Entrapment and Buffers Its Association with Suicidal Ideation in a Sample of Dutch Sexual Minority Emerging Adults,"['Luis A. Parra', 'Diana D van Bergen', 'Eva Dumon[...]', 'David M Frost']","Sexual minority emerging adults are more likely to engage in suicidal ideation than their heterosexual counterparts. Experiences of homophobic violence are associated with suicidal ideation. Yet, the specific mechanisms linking homophobic violence to suicidal ideation remain unclear. Entrapment and social belongingness were tested to determine their relevance for understanding the link between homophobic violence and suicidal ideation. A sample of sexual minority Dutch emerging adults (N = 675; ages 18–29, M = 21.93 years, SD = 3.20) were recruited through online platforms and flyers. Homophobic violence was expected to be positively associated with suicidal ideation and entrapment. The association between homophobic violence and suicidal ideation was expected to be indirectly linked through entrapment. We explored whether various sources of social belongingness moderated the path between entrapment and suicidal ideation and whether those sources of social belongingness moderated the indirect effect of homophobic violence on suicidal ideation through entrapment. Results showed that homophobic violence and entrapment were positively associated with suicidal ideation and that family belongingness was negatively associated with suicidal ideation. Homophobic violence and suicidal ideation were not indirectly linked through entrapment. The interaction effect between entrapment and family belongingness was significant, suggesting that, on average, the effect of entrapment on suicidal ideation decreased when family belongingness was high. These results suggest that family belongingness may reduce the association between entrapment and suicidal ideation while adjusting for homophonic violence. Reducing entrapment and impr

‘Punishing those who do the wrong thing’: Enforcing destitution and debt through the UK’s family migration rules,"['Eve Dickson', 'Rachel Rosen']","In 2012, the ‘no recourse to public funds’ (NRPF) condition was extended to long-standing migrant families in the UK who had previously achieved rights to residence and welfare through human rights mechanisms. Through close examination of policy, political statements, and media coverage, we make the case that the NRPF extension was – and continues to be – intentionally subjugating and punitive, most aptly understood as a policy of enforced destitution and debt imposed on negatively-racialised post-colonial subjects. In drawing out the implications of our argument, we point to time, destitution, and debt as core technologies of the UK’s migration regime, alongside everyday bordering, detention, and deportability. Denying support through NRPF serves to exclude putatively included migrants while normalising conditional approaches to social support. Our article reveals why moral arguments against NRPF based on destitution fail and suggests that challenging welfare bordering requires a more systemic appraisal of policy frames, intentions and effects.",Article,0.0, Critical Social Policy,Jan 6,0,"

"Longitudinal trends in PrEP familiarity, attitudes, use and discontinuation among a national probability sample of gay and bisexual men, 2016–2018","['Ian W Holloway', 'Evan A. Krueger', 'Ilan H Meyer[...]', 'Phillip L. Hammack']","This study explored familiarity with, attitudes toward, uptake and discontinuation of PrEP (Pre-exposure prophylaxis) among a national probability sample of gay and bisexual men. PrEP is one of the most effective biomedical HIV prevention strategies; however, use among gay and bisexual men remains low within the United States. This study used a national probability sample of gay and bisexual men from three age cohorts of men (18–25, 34–41, and 52–59 years at wave 1) who completed three annual surveys between March 2016 and March 2018 (N at wave 1 = 624). Recruitment occurred through a Gallup dual-frame sampling procedure; results for this study came from eligible individuals who consented to be part of the self-administered online or mailed survey questionnaire. We used descriptive data with sampling weights to understand trends in PrEP familiarity, PrEP attitudes and PrEP use across all three time points. Next, PrEP uptake and discontinuation were assessed among men completing all three surveys and who remained eligible for PrEP at all three time points (N = 181). PrEP familiarity increased considerably between 2016 and 2018 among those eligible for PrEP (from 59.8% from wave 1 to 92.0% at wave 3). Favorable attitudes toward PrEP increased more modestly (from 68.3% at wave 1 to 72.7% at wave 3). While PrEP use increased by 90% between the two time points (from 4.1% in 2016 to 7.8% in 2018), this represented a small percentage of overall uptake among eligible participants across time (6.6%). Among respondents who reported PrEP use at wave 1 or wave 2, 33.3% subsequently discontinued PrEP use at a later wave.

This chapter analyses data from a unique sample of essays written by members of the National Child Development Study (NCDS), the 1958 British birth cohort study, when they were eleven years old in 1969, on the topic of ‘Imagine you are twenty-five…’. It explores girls’ accounts of their imagined future family lives, focusing in particular how they imagined combining paid and domestic work. It aims to highlight children’s writing as a resource for research, and demonstrates that however cursory the task children are asked to undertake, they are creative, constructive and innovative in their responses, and that what they create may tell us something about their current circumstances and social context, and about their capacity for keen, perceptive observation. However, the chapter also urges caution and suggests that we need to retain a critical stance towards the utility of asking children to predict their futures.",Chapter,,,Jan 1,0,"

The gendered politics of recognition and recognizability through political apology,['Emma Dolan'],"This article focuses on the performative recognition offered to victims through political apologies for conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV). It engages with understandings of political apology as an act of acknowledgment and moral visibility that has the capacity to further include marginalized accounts of violence or injustice within exclusive national histories/memberships. I introduce feminist understandings of visibility as ambivalent alongside a differential politics of “grievability” in order to suggest that political apologies must always recognize and make visible particular accounts of violence and subject positions; however, they simultaneously obscure others. I problematize the gendered and gendering effects of this process in relation to two cases of apology for CRSV: the Japanese imperial “comfort women” and the US Abu Ghraib torture scandal during the Global War on Terror (GWoT).",Article,1.0, Journal of Human Rights,Nov 11,0,"

Lone organizers: Opposition party-building in hostile places in Tanzania,['Dan Paget'],"I ask where African opposition parties organize. Party-building is communicative; it involves persuading people to become activists. The literature suggests that opposition parties organize where people are receptive to their messages and build outwards from there. I study Chadema’s opposition party-building through site-intensive fieldwork. Chadema organized primarily in such receptive areas, but also in four unreceptive constituencies. I use these deviant constituencies to refine the literature. Prior theory neglects the heterogeneity of party-building. I decompose party-building into three modes as follows: by touring leaders, branches and concentrating leaders. Concentrating leaders dedicate their organizing to single places. They employ small rallies which afford interactive, individualized and iterative communication. This personalized communication enables them to overcome initial unreceptiveness to their messages. I conclude that opposition parties can organize in unreceptive areas, but only through the personalized methods of these ‘lone organizers’. Altogether, I show how and through whom opposition parties organize in hostile environments.",Article,1.0, Party Politics,Oct 29,1,"

The central argument presented in the paper is that renewed impetus for national distinction and self-determination in Scotland is best understood as one facet of a much wider popular disenchantment and growing restiveness with the trajectory of contemporary UK politics, culture and society that has found an outlet via a resurgent nationalist discourse and institutional framework. Analysis here is approached via the application of an original biosocial theory with the aim of presenting further insights into the underlying processes driving contemporary political instability. Moreover, it is argued that this scenario can be understood, and may shed light upon, the wider rise in nationalist and populist sentiment that is contributing to increasing political turbulence across Europe and beyond.",Article,1.0, British Politics,Oct 2,0,"

Ferocious and Fragile: Egypt and the Myth of ‘Authoritarian Stability’,"['Gennaro Gervasio', 'Andrea Teti']","During the Arab Uprisings (or ‘Arab Spring’), the EU recognized that the populations in its ‘Southern Neighborhood’ had been marginalized politically and economically; that this produced instability in politics, economics, and security; and that EU policy needed to correct its previous mistake of equating authoritarian repression with stability. Unfortunately, the wrong lessons have been learned from the Uprisings: Europe’s Union and its most powerful states have returned to focusing ‘stability’ understood as a mere lack of change, and to believing that supporting violently authoritarian regimes is an acceptable ‘cost of doing business’ to keep migration in check and to counter terrorism in Europe’s ‘heartland’. After a brief review of the historical context within which Egypt’s current regime emerged, this contribution criticizes the orthodox analytical and policy narratives which represent Egypt as a ‘beacon of stability’ in a turbulent MENA Region, outlining an alternative view which highlights the structural causes of instability in regimes like Egypt’s. It then outlines this instability by noting Egypt’s own post-2013 track record on key domestic and regional issues. The chapter concludes by criticizing the way Western governments invoke the concept of ‘national interest’ to supporting al-Sisi’s (al-Sīsī) regime and those like it, noting that this approach reflects an inability to accept the evidence of the failure of authoritarian regimes to stabilize either internally or externally.",Chapter,,,Sep 22,0,"

Camelid Fleece and the Hidden Histories of Colors in the Andes,['Penelope Dransart'],"This article explores the significance of natural fleece colors that are often hidden by dyeing processes. The earliest domesticated alpacas and llamas probably resembled vicuñas and guanacos, their wild counterparts. By 3000 years ago, differences were beginning to emerge in the coats of alpacas and llamas. Dyers, spinners, and weavers learned to exploit these variations to complement and extend the range of possibilities offered through the use of dyed yarns. The evidence from the Siguas and Nasca cultural traditions considered here is both direct and indirect, taking into account textile remains and the depiction of camelids on ceramics. It indicates that all white camelids had emerged before c. AD 500. With Tiwanaku and Wari cultural expansion in the South-Central Andes and Central Andes, requirements for certain fleece types resulted in the production of greater quantities of white and black fleece. Tiwanaku tapestries typically have a dark ground against which reds, blues and blues resonate, with white and yellows providing accents. While some Wari textiles share this use of a dark ground, a considerable number of tapestries and tie-dyed textiles depended on the availability of white and beige to enable pinks, yellows, and other bright hues to shine. Flamingo pink, like millennial pink, became a Wari cultural signifier. To understand this phenomenon, the properties of fleece, including its undyed affordances, must be taken into account as well as the dyestuffs used to enhance the color range.",Article,,,Sep 3,0,"

Rediscovering the ‘Noble Savage’: The Rewilding Movement and the Re-Enchantment of the Scottish Highlands,['John Bone'],"This paper focuses on an exploration of an emerging and controversial trend in animal/environmental activism, the rewilding movement, and in particular issues arising from the identification of the Scottish Highlands as a suitable site for rewilding. The rewilding movement contrasts with traditional conservationism in asserting that environmental revitalisation is best achieved through returning designated rural areas to a state broadly approximating that which existed prior to large scale human intervention, as opposed to merely conserving existing plants and fauna. Moreover, a key aspect of this process involves the reintroduction of 'missing species', in the form of apex predators such as Lynx, Boar and Wolf, where the latter are suggested to play a critical role in restoring 'natural' environments, largely through predation to control the activities and numbers of ungulate species whose grazing inhibits the growth of woodland and, hence, the restoration of ecosystems. The paper addresses various political and socio-economic issues raised by proposals for rewilding in the Scottish Highlands, in terms of tensions with traditional conservationism and, not least, the challenges presented to policymakers and publics with respect to predatory species reintroduction, including perceptions of risk to livestock and, indeed, humans. With respect to the latter, more fundamental theoretical questions are also addressed, including the way in which discourses around rewilding have been constructed by both advocates and critics of this phenomenon.",Article,8.0, Scottish Affairs,Aug 20,0,"

The Nature of Structure: A Biosocial Approach,['John Bone'],"This paper considers how developments within the neurosciences might be applied to advance sociologists' (and other social scientists') understanding of social selves and social processes and, importantly, why this might be a fruitful pursuit despite some residual reservations within the discipline. With respect to the latter, the argument presented is firstly approached by briefly reflecting upon sociologists' lingering reticence with respect to engagement with biology, albeit that there has been some softening of this position over the last decade or so. This piece asserts that overcoming remaining sociological reservations regarding the biological offers considerable potential, in terms of enhancing our theoretical models and understanding of aspects of the social world, potentially offering fresh insights with respect to some perennial issues and concepts. Here, an example of this potential is offered through a neurosociological reframing of the foundations of social structure and the rationalization of conduct.",Article,6.0, Sociological Review,,0,"

"Neoliberal precarity and primalization : A biosocial perspective on the age of insecurity, injustice, and unreason",['John Bone'],"In light of the observed rise in social instability and populist politics that has emerged recently even in some of the world's oldest and presumed stable democracies, this paper reappraises the role of the neoliberal political and economic consensus in fermenting popular discontent. While this is very well trodden ground the paper approaches the issues from a wholly new direction, specifically addressing how exposure to the destabilizing conditions of the present can be seen to have negatively impacted on the neurological functioning of many of the disenchanted and distressed of the current era, generating chronic negative emotional arousal and an associated impact on the capacity for rational thought and conduct. This condition of mental and emotional fugue, it is argued, has also rendered growing numbers more susceptible to marginal and radicalizing discourses, largely extended and amplified via social media, and not least the emotionally charged overtures of populist politicians. Against a backdrop of increasing insecurity, transformative changes to work and living conditions precipitated by neoliberal policy and the digital revolution, together with the epochal crisis presented by the global pandemic, it is argued that the task of understanding the deep and fundamental causes of social and political fracture have rarely been more urgent.",Article,1.0, British Journal of Sociology,Aug 19,0,"

Doing waki in San Pablo de Lípez: Reciprocity between the living and the dead,['Maggie Bolton'],"This article has two distinct but related themes. The first is the relationship between the living and the dead in Andean communities, illustrated through the ritual waki. In San Pablo de Lípez, the dead are associated with fertility and with the coming of the rains, but also require help from the living in the form of offerings of liquids and food. The term waki derives from the Andean vocabulary of reciprocal exchange, which is the second theme of the article. On the basis of historical, linguistic, and ethnographic evidence, it is argued that exchanges are of two types, one involving long-term relationships with an expectation of return, and the other short-term transactions in which a payment completes the deal. These do not coincide with nonmonetary and monetary exchanges. It is also argued that the vocabulary deriving from symmetrical reciprocal exchanges can be employed ideologically to mask the nature of unequal exchange relationships.",Article,2.0, Anthropos: International Review of Anthropology and Linguistics,Aug 13,0,"

Election Campaigns and Political Mobilisation (in Africa),['Dan Paget'],"Politicians mobilise people to vote by devising messages and imparting them to voters. Many studies examine electioneering through a framework that distinguishes between programmatic, clientelist and charismatic appeals. Few politicians appeal to people by adopting particular policy positions, the strict sense of ‘programmatic appeals’. However, almost all solicit peoples’ support by stressing their sincere intentions and their abilities to pursue uncontroversial aspects of government, otherwise known as ‘valence appeals’. Parties’ historic records and their locations in government or opposition affect which issues they can claim to own and which they stress in their campaigns. While public policy is all but ubiquitous in African electoral politics, so too is clientelism. Many politicians give voters gifts, in the form of favourable distributions of public service delivery, in-kind goods, and cash. However, few of these gifts constitute contingent exchanges of goods for votes. Instead, political largesse is used to flatter, to impress and to convince voters of politicians’ virtue. In this respect, public policy and clientelism frequently appear in African elections side-by-side. Studies of appeals order studies of political messages, and shed light on how electoral politics affects public policy. However, it also obscures. A separate canon of work studies political discourses in sub-Saharan Africa. One of the most-studied subjects in this strain of the literature is populism. African populisms have been conceived of by some as discourses that unite disparate groups against an elite, and as an electoral strategy that draws together particular constituencies by others.

The Rally-Intensive Campaign: A Distinct Form of Electioneering in Sub-Saharan Africa and Beyond,['Dan Paget'],"I consider how to characterize and classify election campaigns in sub-Saharan Africa. I revisit the typology proposed by Pippa Norris, which distinguishes between premodern, modern, and postmodern campaigns. This typology, and others like it, homogenizes ground campaigns. Ground campaigns only feature by virtue of their centrality in premodern campaigns and their peripherality in modern and postmodern campaigns. I argue that the prominence of the rally varies across ground campaigns. By trivializing rallies, current typologies obscure this variation between African campaigns and between campaigns in sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world. To accommodate these differences, I propose a schema of campaign ecologies, adapted from Norris’ own, which incorporates a distinct ideal-type: the rally-intensive campaign. This revision internationalizes this hitherto Western-bound typology and may illuminate the features of campaigns in other middle- and low-income countries too. Equally, it throws into relief differences between historic premodern campaigns in Western countries. I contend that rally-intensiveness is a definitive feature of election campaigns from which other features stem. To illuminate such typical features, I study Tanzania, which has the most rally-intensive campaigns in Africa. I draw on ethnographic research and original survey data to identify the four following typical features of the rally-intensive campaign. Local as well as national leaders hold rallies frequently. Local rallies are better attended in aggregate than national ones, and accordingly, campaign contact is direct. Mass meetings dwarf the canvass as a means of campaign contact, and local party networks concentrate their efforts on “producing” rallies.",Article,9.0, The International Journal of Press/Politics,,1,"

The authoritarian origins of well-organized opposition parties: The rise of Chadema in Tanzania,['Dan Paget'],"This article concerns the organizational expansion undertaken by the opposition party, Chadema, in Tanzania between 2003 and 2015. It argues that Chadema’s extensive party-building enabled it to mobilize on the ground. These organizational developments, as much as elite action, underpinned recent changes in the party system and the opposition’s improved showing in recent elections. Chadema established branches even though many of the prerequisite circumstances typically recognized in the literature were absent. This makes Chadema a deviant case and this deviance has implications for the historical institutionalist literature on party-building. This article complicates Rachel Riedl’s account of state substitution. She links the incorporation or substitution of social actors to different paths of party system institutionalization. This article demonstrates that the character and consequences of state substitution depend upon the balance of power between state and social actors. It also builds on accounts by Adrienne LeBas and others that when social actors are strong, they can endow opposition parties with resources which make branch establishment possible, and when they are weak, they can only act as surrogate party branches. This article illustrates that when social actors are absent from partisan politics, parties have no way to organize except by founding green-site branches.",Article,9.0, African Affairs,Jul 30,0,"

"Again, making Tanzania great: Magufuli’s restorationist developmental nationalism",['Dan Paget'],"This article is about how ideologies legitimize authoritarianism. The literature argues that liberation nationalists discursively construct “liberation” as an ongoing struggle and justify their authoritarian rule until its completion. By recurrently postponing liberation, they extend this justification of authoritarianism. Nonetheless, their claim that the nation is part-way through liberation becomes less plausible over time. Liberation nationalism shares a discursive structure with a parallel class of developmental nationalisms. I analyse the ideology of President Magufuli and CCM in Tanzania. Instead of claiming that the nation is mid-transformation, they constructed the status quo as a corrupt deviation from a past order: “Nyerere’s Tanzania”. They conceived of this past order as a nation dedicated to industrial development which would lead to a transformed future. They advocated rupture with the present, the restoration of the past and the resumption of this transformative journey. Restorationism relieves liberation and developmental nationalisms of the rising rhetorical challenge of claiming that the nation has been on a transformative path since liberation.

"Book Review: Stereotypes and Prejudice in Conflict: Representations of Arabs in Israeli Jewish Society By Daniel Bar-Tal and Yona Teichman (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2005. 502 pages.)",['Luisa Gandolfo'],"During the last twenty years, a discernible increase in the analysis of stereotypes and the role they assume during conflicts has occurred, with significant interest emanating from the field of social psychology. For the authors of Stereotypes and Prejudice in Conflict: Representations of Arabs in Israeli Jewish Society, years of research have culminated in a publication that unflinchingly explores such diverse topics as delegitimization tactics and unity as well as the development of perceptions among pre-schoolers. Daniel Bar-Tal, a professor in Tel Aviv University’s Psychology Department, is the author of several notable works on the issue, including Social Psychology of Intergroup Conflict (Springer-Verlag: 1998) and How Children Understand War and Peace (Jossey Bass: 1999). Likewise, Yona Teichman, a clinical psychologist at Tel Aviv University, brings a level of expertise honed from extensive research on the development and application of an implicit, free-response measure of social representations based on the systematic analysis of human figure drawings. Through this dynamic, they strive to contribute to future peace endeavors by prompting the critical analysis of one’s own society and the processes that impede conflict resolution, while encouraging new perspectives that will end the violent cycles that sustain conflict. From a strong opening chapter, the authors negotiate through twelve chapters adeptly, the most notable of which include chapter 4, “Representation of Arabs in Public Discourse”; chapter 5, “Representation of Arabs in School Textbooks”; and chapter 10, “Studies with Schoolchildren, Adolescents, and Young Adults.” All of these chapters are supported by a plethora of tables comprising generali

"Book Review: Jordanian Jerusalem: Holy Places and National Spaces By Kimberly Katz (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2005. 214 pages.)",['Luisa Gandolfo'],"For centuries, Jerusalem has been revered as the holy site of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam; strategically coveted as a means to consolidate territorial gains; and conquered thirty-seven times between its foundation and the sequestering of its ancient hub by Israeli forces during the Six-Day War. As the region underwent significant change after World War II, the Holy City increasingly became contested. While the Palestinians nurtured concerns regarding land sales and the escalating influx of Jewish settlers, their apprehension became lost amidst the tussle for authority between Transjordan, which sought to affirm its role as custodian of the holy places, and the nascent state of Israel, which strove to strengthen its presence in the city. Charting the endeavors of KingAbdullah and KingHussein to assert Transjordan’s authority over Jerusalemdespite international and Israeli rivalry, Katz affords a unique insight into the multifarious means used to court its residents through events, banknotes, and stamps between 1948 and 1967. Over the course of seven chapters, the author imbues the text with illuminating figures and maps. Most notable is the 1946 “Palestinian Aid” stamp series initiated during the Bludan Conference in June 1946, during which Abdullah directed member states of the Arab League “to issue a Palestinian stamp whose revenue would be earmarked for Palestine” (p. 56). Yet Abdullah’s pro-active stance – the Jordanian Parliament implemented the Arab League resolution on 22 July 1946, followed by the “Additional Stamps Law” Temporary Law 20 of the same year – was ultimately marred by his series of surreptitious meetings with the JewishAgency. Despite this duplicity, the merit of stamps in preserving stable relations with the Palestinians is

"The sociology of conversion narratives: A conundrum, a theory, and an opportunity",['Andrew Mckinnon'],"Using Paul Ricoeur's theory of narrative to consider Lofland and Stark's classic 'Becoming a World-Saver', I address a fundamental conundrum in the sociology of conversion. If the conversion story is told in the new light of the new discourse-brought about by the conversion-how can the sociologist use it to explain the conversion and the factors that led to it? We consider the extent to which the sociology of religion has conflated the necessary elements of narrative structure for the stages of conversion. Taking into consideration more recent research, the paper makes a case for careful and comparative sociological study of conversion narratives-considered as narrative accounts. I argue that doing so further opens up avenues for research, particularly if we consider the audiences for whom the stories are told and the purposes the stories serve, and a ultimately constitutes a sound basis for considering the processes of conversion themselves.",Preprint,,,Jun 1,0,"

Transitional Justice in Sri Lanka: Exploration and Analysis,['Ross Donachie'],"The conflict in Sri Lanka left the country with an unresolved legacy of gross human rights abuses and a lack of justice for victims. Transitional justice provides a toolkit to facilitate change through truth seeking measures, reparations, memorialisation initiatives and institutional reform. Through an understanding of the nature and conclusion of the Sri Lankan civil war and the manner in which transitional justice mechanisms have been subsequently implemented it is possible to gain insight into the state of justice for victims of human rights abuses in the country. After examining the progress of transitional justice in Sri Lanka it is clear that there continues to be significant barriers to the implementation of transitional justice initiatives in Sri Lanka originating substantially from the reluctance of the Sinhala-Buddhist majoritarian state to affect institutional change or acknowledge its role in past abuses. Further political instability has the potential to produce additional barriers to transitional justice, and may even reverse the process.",Thesis,,,May 4,0,"

U.S. Efforts to Thwart North Korea’s Nuclear Proliferation - Scrutinising and Explaining Strategic Failure,['Ross Donachie'],"This dissertation discusses and analyses the various approaches taken by successive Presidential administrations of the United States in attempting to denuclearize the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and their respective failings. Each administration has had to deal with the problem of a nuclear North Korea, and yet despite the U.S.’s unparalleled resources and military might is has been unable to prevent the DPRK from developing nuclear weapons or subsequently bring about denuclearization. In its attempts the U.S has employed differing forms of diplomacy, offered economic inducements, pursued harsh sanctions and used conventional and nuclear posturing to influence the DPRK. None of the methods used have been successful. Domestic constraints, naiveite and geopolitical realities have all contributed to this failure. This dissertation adds value to the body of literature about US-DPRK nuclear diplomacy as it covers the entire period of the North Korean nuclear saga; from the first nuclear crisis in the early 1990s to the contemporary dealings between President Trump and Kim Jong-Un.",Thesis,,,,0,"

This comparison shows there is a mismatch between what citizens want and what the EU is offering. While citizens want a 'thicker', socially just democracy, the EU 'offers' a market democracy that prioritises a limited number of civil and political rights. Social and economic rights are discursively constructed as macroeconomic issues relevant to the stability and consolidation of democracy rather than human rights as integral to democracy as their civil-political counterparts.",Article,1.0, The Journal of North African Studies,May 1,1,"

"Book Review: Identity and Religion in Palestine: The Struggle between Islamism and Secularism in the Occupied Territories By Loren D. Lybarger (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 2007. 265 pages.)",['Luisa Gandolfo'],"In recent years a subtle but steady transformation has been taking place in the Arab-Israeli conflict. The prominence of Hamas and the process of Islamization in the West Bank and Gaza are having repercussions on both a local and a regional level, while politics, faith, and nationalism have created a mélange of ideologies.As secularist squares up to Islamist, andHamas and Islamic Jihad vie with the Palestinian Liberation Organization, the objective of the Palestinian struggle becomes trampled in the haste to draw support to either political group. In the midst of this turmoil, Palestinian secular-nationalists are defying their ideological background and turning to religion for support, hope, and survival. The Palestinian political identity is in a state of flux, and Islam’s dominant role in Palestinian society can no longer be ignored or dismissed. The emergence of Loren D. Lybarger’s Identity and Religion in Palestine is, then, a timely publication, as it provides a perceptive analysis of political identities in the Occupied Territories. Through his debut publication, Lybarger draws on interviews and experiences gathered during volunteer work with the Mennonite Central Committee in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. Conducted over a period of six years – three in the 1980s in theWest Bank, two in Gaza in the early 1990s, and one in the West Bank and Gaza from 1999 to 2000 – the author breathes life into accounts of the evolving Palestinian political identity by rendering his respondents’ dilemmas, vulnerabilities, hopes, and fears with startling clarity. By incorporating a plethora of political factions, religious communities, age groups, geographical locations, and socio-economic classes, he cogently assesses the Palestinian political and religious ident

"Book Review: Suicide in Palestine: Narratives of Despair By Nadia Taysir Dabbagh (Northampton, MA: Olive Branch Press, 2005. 265 pages.)",['Luisa Gandolfo'],"Within the context of Islamic thought, suicide has met both tolerance and resistance and has spawned two cultural categories: suicide and martyrdom. Nadia Taysir Dabbagh approaches the issue with a dexterity honed by medical experience, and her insightful analysis of the two concepts reveals that suicide is perceived as a private act condemned by society and religion, while martyrdom is a public act exalted for the greater good. The fusion of theories plucked from psychiatry, anthropology, and psychology and then coupled with compelling case studies conducted in Ramallah and Gaza creates a coverage that treads the line between objective analysis and morbid fascination, as her research contributes a reasoned account of a startling trend largely lost in a region immersed in its tumultuous past and present and uncertain future. This book is the product of an intercalated M.B.–Ph.D. program submitted to the Psychiatry Department at University College London. The introductory chapter incorporates an elucidated methodology that identifies biological, social, and psychological study approaches, with the primary system of analysis resting on the latter. This person-centred technique perceives suicide as an individual phenomenon linked to risk factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, and stressful life events) and associations. Likewise, the social approach favors a broader angle and associates suicide with such social conditions as unemployment, domestic violence, and sociopolitical protest. The biological approach draws a correlation between affective disorders, such as bipolar disorder, and suicide. Eminent suicidologists, such as Michael Kral, Silvia S. Canetto, and David Lester, who assert that suicidal behavior should be placed in it

"Book Review: A Concise History of the Middle East, 8th ed.: By Arthur Goldschmidt Jr. and Lawrence Davidson (Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, 2006. 559 pages.)",['Luisa Gandolfo'],"In a discipline rich in studies addressing the multifarious aspects of the Middle East, a publication exploring the region’s history fromthe pre-Islamic period to the present confronts a fervent contest in establishing itself as a notable work. As the authors of A Concise History of the Middle East indicate from the outset, the challenge of conveying the relevance of past events to contemporary affairs is both complex yet essential. For Arthur Goldschmidt Jr. and Lawrence Davidson, the course is well-worn, as their publication enters its eighth edition since 1979.With a plethora of maps depicting the transitory regional borders dating from the Byzantine period to the present day, alongside cogent depictions of the Hashemite lineage and the Ottoman sultans and a piquant narrative, Goldschmidt and Davidson provide an account that proves – although directed toward undergraduate students and neophytes to the Middle East – a satisfying meander through regional triumphs and despairs over the course of twenty-one chapters. Consigned as “a dreary bore, a dead subject suited only to cranks, antique-lovers, or perhaps a few students seeking bits of small talk with which to impress their peers” (p. 2), the authors grapple with the waning allure of history in contemporary society in their introduction. Aware of the limitations, the opening chapter strives to rouse the reader with a swift assessment of the Middle East’s global contributions to language, religion, philosophy, mathematics, and science.Avoiding the plaintive plea to comprehend the origins of the current conflicts, the authors combine drollness with facts to ensure that the narrative does not falter and reiterate poignant questions throughout the publication, such as: “AsAmericans, who may at times ...",Article,8.0, American Journal of Islam and Society,,0,"

Khoury, and Emily Welty (Washington, DC: United States Institute of Peace Press, 2007. 285 pages.)",['Luisa Gandolfo'],"The field of conflict resolution has rarely been tested so frequently as in the Middle East. Since 1948, internecine conflict has flared in Israel/Palestine, Lebanon, and Iraq, with neighboring states sustaining the consequences of the tensions.Applying interfaith dialogue (IFD) as ameans to promote peaceful relations is thus, by its very nature, fraught with controversy and uncertainty. Yet this unique approach draws on peace-building mechanisms that bear such religious nuances as reconciliation, mercy, and forgiveness. By eschewing secular concepts for religious resources, IFD provides a point from which individuals can transcend the religious divide in search of further understanding and peace.Accordingly, following the activities of IFD organizations in Israel/Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, and Lebanon is a complex undertaking for the authors of Unity in Diversity. Having previously addressed Nonviolence and Peacebuilding in Islam: Theory and Practice (University Press of Florida: 2003) and Dialogue, Conflict Resolution, and Change: Arab-Jewish Encounters in Israel (State University of New York Press: 1999), Abu-Nimer, an associate professor with the International Peace and Conflict Resolution Program, lends a revealing insight into faith-based resolution.

The essay revisits the terms revolutionary and revolution within the Tunisian context and reflects on the application of the label revolutionary , contending that the act of selective labeling bears implications for an objective understanding of the revolution and its actors.

"Transactions, space and Otherness: borders and boundaries in Palestine–Israel",['Luisa Gandolfo'],"In the context of conflict narratives, boundaries, borders and borderlanders serve as facilitators or inhibitors of peace. In Palestine–Israel, demarcation is enacted through the separation wall, the Green Line and the smart fence along the Gaza Strip. To the established boundaries, informal demarcations are added, running through the land and communities physically, in the case of Firing Zone 918, and ideologically through Othering and transactions in the zones of transition. This article considers Othering and the negotiation of space in the context of (un)official boundaries in the West Bank and deconstructs the intersection of culture, politics and place, as well as the boundary practices enacted by the state, community and the individual. First, the article distinguishes between the types of borders and boundaries in the West Bank, before considering the manner in which Otherness is practiced in the context of movement and the separation wall, as residents negotiate the transition through and around the barrier. From Othering in the transition zone, the study questions how far the experiences of Palestinians and Israelis correlate with the broader border/boundary discourse, the extent to which negative reciprocity is practiced at the checkpoints, and whether subliminal boundaries and (re)naming influences stability in the region.",Article,6.0, Journal of Cultural Geography,,1,"

Juxtaposing narratives and material mnemonics, this article assumes the villages of Deir Yassin, Suba, Kufr Bir’im and Iqrit as case studies to determine the extent to which memory infuses ruins with the ability to counter contemporary narratives. The article subsequently explores the use of debris in the sustenance of national memory, and questions how far “haunting” the land through commemorative tours and in situ story-telling renders the ruins noeuds de mémoire, as opposed to lieux de mémoire. Finally, the transition of the ruins from sites of history to sites of activism is charted through the use of theatre and technology that draw on the past and present as forms of cultural resistance.",Article,6.0, Social Semiotics,,1,"

Navigating Trust and Distrust in the Refugee Community of Malta,['Luisa Gandolfo'],"This article considers how trust is constructed in the refugee community of Malta, against the backdrop of ongoing and recurrent unrest in Libya. As social trust is re-evaluated, social spaces have become sites of tension where divisions re-emerge along political, ideological, and economic lines. By focusing on the Libyan diaspora, the article presents an insight into the ways that conflict trauma shapes trust-building, and considers the challenges faced by civil society organisations and government bodies in their efforts to facilitate support and community-building on the island. The article is based on 14 interviews conducted in 2015 with members of the Libyan diaspora, and Maltese civil society organisations and government bodies. The interviewees discussed the multifaceted aspects of trust-building, including the legacy of 42 years of political distrust during the regime of the former Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, regional affiliations and divisions, and the continuum of trauma that unfolds in the Maltese Open Centres and in the host community. The findings of the study indicate that there are additional structural impediments that extend beyond the ongoing conflict, including the Maltese detention process, the redrawing of political boundaries around social spaces in the towns, and the role of identity, which present determining factors in the building of social trust. Collectively, these aspects hold implications for integration into the diaspora community on the island, while in the long term, individual recovery from conflict trauma is dependent on the trust-networks that are constructed, or joined, by the refugees.",Article,1.0, Journal of International Migration and Integration / Revue de l integration et de la migration internationale,Apr 1,0,"

Specifically, it examines the centrality of the religious congruence fallacy in the narratives of nonreligious people. Based on 60 qualitative interviews with Polish nones, I chart the ways in which they make sense of the dominant model of Polish-Catholic religiosity, commonly referred to as the ""Polak-Katolik"". The findings demonstrate that nonreligious Poles equate Polish Catholicism with hypocrisy, conformity, and an implicit fear of ostracism. In conclusion, I suggest that it is vital that scholars of nonreligion flesh out the complexities of the relationship between the nones and the religiously homogenous cultures within which they exist.",Article,1.0, Social Compass,Mar 30,0,"

Reagan ran under the slogan ‘Let’s make America great again’, which was later revived by Donald Trump, albeit truncated into the shorter ‘MAGA’. As we are increasingly seeing, ‘they’ are still waiting for a greater future to be imported from the imagined past, and not only in America.

"Absence, Gender, and the Land(Scape) in Palestinian Art",['Luisa Gandolfo'],"Since the early twentieth century, the Palestinian landscape has passed through social, political, and economic changes that have brought displacement, the fall of old towns, and the rise of new ones. This chapter reflects on the extent to which the landscape provides a medium to address resistance, as well as commemoration, in the absence of the villages and their inhabitants. To do this, the chapter looks at how gendered representations of the land have shifted since 1948 to the present day with reference to the works of Sophie Halaby (1906–1998), Tamam Al-Akhal (1935–), Mona Hatoum (1952–), Emily Jacir (1970–), and Sama Alshaibi (1973–). In doing so, it traces the movement from the inferred gendering of the land through vistas devoid of people, to the recurrent image of Palestinian womanhood, and finally, the tangible female body as represented through photography and audio-visual pieces.",Chapter,,,,0,"

"Christians, Muslims and Traditional Worshippers in Nigeria: Estimating the Relative Proportions from Eleven Nationally Representative Social Surveys",['Andrew Mckinnon'],"Background The absence of census data on religious identification in Nigeria since 1963 leaves much uncertainty about the most basic religious composition of the country. It is generally accepted that identification with traditional worship declined over the middle of the twentieth century as identification with Islam and Christianity increased, leaving these the two dominant religious groups in the country. The current relative proportions of Christians and Muslims has often been the subject of conjecture, guesswork and assertion, as have trajectories of growth or decline. Purpose Where researchers have used sound data to address this question, they have often drawn on a single survey, or, if on multiple data sources, it is unclear how the different estimates the data provides are reconciled. This paper seeks to address these gaps to construct a better picture of the religious composition of Nigeria, and to consider the trajectory of change. Methods This study presents data from 11 nationally representative surveys of adults conducted between 1990 and 2018. Surveys include four waves of the World Values Survey, five waves of the Afrobarometer survey, The Pew Tolerance and Tension survey, and the Nigerian General Household Survey of 2010. Results The results show that identification with Christianity is likely to have been the majority among Nigerian adults through this period. Evidence suggests that identification with Christianity was still growing in the first half of the 1990s, to a high point of 69% of the adult population. This growth was associated with the tail of the decline of identification with traditional worship. Thereafter identification with Christianity has declined in proportional terms as identification with Isla

"When the Winds Run with the Earth: Cannibal Winds and Climate Disruption in Isluga, Northern Chile","['Penelope Dransart', 'Marietta Ortega']","This report uses a conceptual frame of “weather-worlding” to approach, in an atmospherically attuned manner, people’s knowledge concerning the formation and transformation of weather conditions. It explores observed patterning in winds and rains as a product of more than a single generation’s understanding. New ethnographic fieldwork findings from Isluga, northern Chile, are juxtaposed with information from notes made during previous periods of fieldwork the authors have conducted since the late 1970s and the 1980s. Comparisons with other anthropologists’ findings, seventeenth-century dictionary entries, and meteorological explanations are used to deepen the historical context for how people talk about winds, rain, and weather disruptions. While their observations of rainfall patterns concur with meteorologically collected data in important aspects, their accounts of disruptions to weather patterns provide a vivid portrayal of the winds’ unpredictable power to prevent precipitation from falling during the rainy season. People’s sensorial experiences of the winds emphasize the nonvisual, audible character of the elements, and our research participants personify bitterly cold westerlies as unruly, disruptive cannibal brothers. The text of this report coalesces round the themes of living in an arid land shaped by winds and what happens when the seasons are disrupted in a ceaselessly wind-blown atmosphere.",Article,1.0, Current Anthropology,Feb 17,0,"

The Refugee Crisis through the Lens of Biopolitics: Comparative Analysis of Refugees' Marginalization in the Greek Camp and their Political Empowerment in the Squatted Building,['Sofia Pesiou'],"Abstract My thesis examines the various levels of refugees’ political empowerment or exclusion from decision making processes in two distinct physical spaces; the refugee camp and the squatted house. In the light of Foucauldian and Agambeian biopolitical theory about diminishing of life to bare existence and under the influence of Judith Butler and Guy Standing about vulnerability and precariousness of modern mobile refugee and migrant, I examine three relocation camps in Northern Greece and three squats in the city centre of Thessaloniki as to the opportunities they offer to refugees for political participation and representation, the power dynamics with non-government and civil society organizations and the effect that anti-systemic groups may have on their future political presence. I necessarily engage in a discussion about the role of care regimes in cases of humanitarian crises and I observe the power dynamics among all the various bodies in a camp as well as the relationships of refugees, activists and anarchists in a squat. It is a qualitative research that employs elements from ethnography as well as Glasser and Strauss’ grounded theory. The drawn conclusion affirm a tendency for the refugee to be silenced, often excluded from negotiation table and being treated as a child or victim in bigger relocation camps while in smaller settlements they are largely guided by civil society movements. In contrast, life in a squat, engagement in social activities and interaction with local activists appears to empower refugees significantly more than life in camps in addition to orienting them to claim their rights of political participation and self-management. My thesis highlights the importance of taking biopolitical theory into seri

Latin America,"['Andrea Oelsner', 'Mervyn Bain']","This chapter examines the main features of the undemocratic regimes that were in power in Latin America from the late 1960s, along with the democratization processes that followed since the 1980s. The nature of the non-democratic governments varied throughout the region, and consequently the types of transition and the quality of the resulting democracy varied as well. The chapter focuses on four cases that reflect these differences: Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela. For each country, the chapter reviews a number of dimensions that have been relevant in the democratization processes: the historical and international contexts, the role of economic factors, political culture and society, political parties and social movements, and the institutional challenges that still lie ahead.",Chapter,,,Jan 4,0,"

"The Influence of Financial Knowledge, Financial Socialization, Financial Behaviour, and Financial Strain on Young Adults' Financial Well-Being","['Mohamad Fazli Sabri', 'Husniyah Abd.

It has become a crucial concern for individuals, households, societies, and countries in recent years, yet research on the subject is sparse and dispersed among fields. As a result, the current research assessed an empirical financial well-being model based on Malaysian young adults' financial knowledge, financial socialization, financial behavior and financial strain. A multi stage random sampling method was performed to draw a representative sample of Malaysian young adults, and 651 duly filled responses were received through the self-administered questionnaire. As stated by the multiple regression results, 16.1% of the total variance of financial well-being was clarified by the model. All four financial well-being determinants examined (financial knowledge, financial socialization, financial behavior, financial strain) were revealed significant, and only financial strain had a negative relationship with financial well-being. Therefore, current study has both the theoretical and practical contributions, and offers experts with actionable insights regarding the determinants of young adults' financial well-being when designing policies to uplift their financial well-being over time.",Article,,,Dec 14,0,"

"Influence of Financial Behavior, Financial Stress and Locus of Control on Financial Well-Being among B40 Households in Selangor During the Pandemic","['Amirah shazana Magli', 'Mohamad Fazli Sabri', 'Husniyah Abd.

This paper aims to analyse the effects of financial well-being on 428 respondents from B40 households in Selangor districts using non-probability sampling (purposive stratified sample). SPSS Version 26 was used to perform regression analyses to determine factors influencing financial behaviour, financial stress, and locus of control. The fitness of the financial well-being model indicated an R-square value of 0.386. The model explained 38.6 per cent of the variances in financial well-being. Financial well-being was explained by the model's factors comprising financial behaviour, financial stress, internal and external locus of control. Model indicated (F = 65.70; p = .000) were valid models based on the ANOVA output. Financial behaviour and internal locus of control were shown to positively impact financial well-being; whereby financial stress was negatively influencing financial well-being. Financial stress occurs when a person's financial resources are insufficient to meet basic financial needs. Henceforth, those under a lot of financial stress must engage in proper financial activities to be more financially independent. In conclusion, ensuring responsible practices, including excellent financial behaviour practices, strong financial stress management, and high internal locus of control strengthened would assist households in completing their financial management.",Article,,,,0,"

Review of The Factor Influencing and Measurements of Financial Well-Being,"['Amirah shazana Magli', 'Mohamad Fazli Sabri', 'Husniyah Abd. Rahim']","Various indicators have been used to analyse the financial well-being of households during the last few decades (i.e. household income, financial debt, economic, social, financial health, and psychology). Financial well-being, on the other hand, cannot be quantified just on the basis of these few characteristics. It encompasses a variety of factors that influence financial well-being. Thus, this study will examine both objective and subjective qualities, or both subjectively or objectively traits, that contribute to the definition of financial well-being in three selected developed, developing, and underdeveloped countries. The authors conduct a systematic review of the literature (SLR) to inform future research on financial well-being. Identifying prior conceptualisations and definitions of financial well-being was the primary goal of this systemic literature review. Next, the second goal was ascertaining factors that influence financial well-being in three distinct nations. These countries were divided into three categories: developed, developing, and underdeveloped countries. A systematic review enables a researcher to identify the most pertinent papers to address the study issue while minimising errors. As a result of the findings, a subjective method is recognised as a more inclusive technique than an objective approach for defining and measuring a complex and personal phenomenon such as financial well-being. This study is intended to stimulate scholars to continue developing knowledge to enable financial institutions to adopt proactive measures to improve financial well-being.",Article,,,Dec 10,0,"

Discernment from the Youth Standpoint upon Young Leaderships in Politics: A Case Study in Malaysia,"['Bryan Nathen', 'Nur Shuhamin Nazuri', 'Siti Shazwani Ahmad Suhaimi[...]', 'Saiful Nujaimi Abdul Rahman']","In the earlier days of politics, youths were apathetic in the field of politics as the culture of politics was more suited to the older generation. This is because the older generation had more opportunities to cast partisan votes and developed stronger affiliations to the party for which they voted. However, with the ability to access information and engage online for everyone, this heterogeneous culture has given Malaysian youths a new and tangible existence in the scene of politics. Therefore, the purposes of this study is to explore the issues faced by youths in politics, how can aspiring politicians communicate effectively with youths today and to understand how does political communication work in youth circles. The study interviewed fifteen respondents, which all of them were university students between the ages of 18 and 35. The data collection strategy was an in-depth interview followed by a semi-structured interview protocol. Through the thematic analysis, this study found that there are still barriers surrounding politics, which are age, experience, and general perception between old and new politicians, including education, which seems to be a recurring topic. Furthermore, this research also spotted out that females do not have a significant share of voice in politics. This has concluded that the youth political environment remains an undeveloped area in Malaysia.",Article,,,Dec 7,0,"

Applying the Nominal Group Technique for Specifying the Interacting Dimensions Affecting Adherence to Post–Sharps Injury Follow-Up Services,"['Abdullah Aliff Abdul Wahab', 'Rosnah Ismail', 'Asnarulkhadi Abu Samah[...]', 'Halim Ismail']","Scale of adherence to post–sharps injury follow-up services among healthcare workers is uncommon compared to medication adherence scale. To develop a novel and culturally adapted scale, stakeholders should be consulted to specify dimensions by deducing it from the existing framework. This study was to demonstrate how health stakeholders were consulted to specify the dimensions. This study employed two sessions of Nominal Group Technique. Each session consisted of 12 purposive-sampled mixed participants i.e., healthcare managers and providers. A four-step sequential protocol was used for collecting participants’ key ideas on what adherence factors in post–sharps injury follow-up services: silent idea generation, round-robin collection, idea clarification, and ranking. Similar ideas were clustered and coded with an appropriate group theme and categorized it into subdimensions. Results: A total of 116 key ideas, yielding 13 and 10 themes in session 1 and 2, respectively. Those themes were coded into 16 sub-dimensions affecting adherence. They were distributed under five emerged dimensions in decreasing order of relative importance: (a) healthcare team and system-related factors; (b) patient-related factors; (c) therapy-related factors; and (d) condition-related factors. These findings guide researchers in developing culturally adapted items for measuring the level of adherence to post–sharps injury follow-up services.",Article,1.0, Qualitative Report,Nov 26,0,"

Playing games is considered one of the ways to socialize and meet around and create bonding. However, study in South Korea and China revealed that 24% of children in the respective country are diagnosed with heavy internet addiction especially in gaming. Hence, the current study attempted to determine the effect of virtual mobile and computer gaming on physical and health among undergraduate students at the University of Suwon (USW), South Korea. Through a quantitative survey among University of Suwon students, this study confirmed high level of daily routine activity, sleeping disorder, and anxiety. On the other hand, they also have moderate levels of depression and low level of social dysfunction. This study concluded that in general, the undergraduate students in Suwon University have moderate health level and the students are still facing the consequences of the effects of addiction due to heavy usage on mobile and computer gaming.",Article,,,Oct 18,1,"

Promotion of behavioural change for health in a heterogeneous population,"['Robin Schimmelpfennig', 'Sonja Vogt', 'Sönke Ehret', 'Charles Efferson']","Public health policy often involves implementing cost-efficient, large-scale interventions. When mandating or forbidding a specific behaviour is not permissible, public health professionals may draw on behaviour change interventions to achieve socially beneficial policy objectives. Interventions can have two main effects: (i) a direct effect on people initially targeted by the intervention; and (ii) an indirect effect mediated by social influence and by the observation of other people's behaviour. However, people's attitudes and beliefs can differ markedly throughout the population, with the result that these two effects can interact to produce unexpected, unhelpful and counterintuitive consequences. Public health professionals need to understand this interaction better. This paper illustrates the key principles of this interaction by examining two important areas of public health policy: tobacco smoking and vaccination. The example of antismoking campaigns shows when and how public health professionals can amplify the effects of a behaviour change intervention by taking advantage of the indirect pathway. The example of vaccination campaigns illustrates how underlying incentive structures, particularly anticoordination incentives, can interfere with the indirect effect of an intervention and stall efforts to scale up its implementation. Recommendations are presented on how public health professionals can maximize the total effect of behaviour change interventions in heterogeneous populations based on these concepts and examples.",Article,1.0, Bulletin of the World Health Organisation,3d ago,1,"

Paradox of diversity in the collective brain,"['Robin Schimmelpfennig', 'Layla Razek', 'Eric Schnell', 'Michael Muthukrishna']","Human societies are collective brains. People within every society have cultural brains—brains that have evolved to selectively seek out adaptive knowledge and socially transmit solutions. Innovations emerge at a population level through the transmission of serendipitous mistakes, incremental improvements and novel recombinations. The rate of innovation through these mechanisms is a function of (1) a society's size and interconnectedness (sociality), which affects the number of models available for learning; (2) fidelity of information transmission, which affects how much information is lost during social learning; and (3) cultural trait diversity, which affects the range of possible solutions available for recombination. In general, and perhaps surprisingly, all three levers can increase and harm innovation by creating challenges around coordination, conformity and communication. Here, we focus on the ‘paradox of diversity’—that cultural trait diversity offers the largest potential for empowering innovation, but also poses difficult challenges at both an organizational and societal level. We introduce ‘cultural evolvability’ as a framework for tackling these challenges, with implications for entrepreneurship, polarization and a nuanced understanding of the effects of diversity. This framework can guide researchers and practitioners in how to reap the benefits of diversity by reducing costs.

The Size of the Stag Determines the Level of Cooperation,"['Eric Schnell', 'Robin Schimmelpfennig', 'Michael Muthukrishna']","In the last 12,000 years, human societies have scaled up from small bands to large states of millions and even billions. Many modern societies and even groups of societies cooperate on large-scale projects with relatively low levels of conflict, but the scale and intensity of cooperation varies dramatically between societies. Here we attempt to formalize dynamics that may be driving this rapid increase in cooperation and the differences we see between societies. Our model extends an N-person stag hunt to include population growth dynamics, ""stags"" with different sized payoffs, and competition for these stags. An increasing number of cooperators is required to access larger stags. The payoff from these stags in turn increases carrying capacity, which increases competition for the stag. As population size increases, new cooperative thresholds are attainable, and as population size shrinks, previously attainable thresholds fall out of reach. Among other predictions, we show that when a new threshold is accessible to a population, the level of cooperation will increase to reach this threshold. However, when the next threshold is out of reach, cooperation decreases as individuals refrain from costly cooperation, preferring a smaller stag. This model offers a framework for understanding the rapid increase in the scale of human cooperation and decline of violence, differences between societies, and challenges to future cooperation.",Preprint,,,Dec 7,1,"

Cockpit Voice Recorder transcript data: capturing safety voice and safety listening during historic aviation accidents,"['Mark Noort', 'Tom W. Reader', 'Alex Gillespie']","Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) transcripts capture audio data within cockpit environments. This aids the investigation of causal factors contributing to aviation accidents by revealing communication and other sounds prior to aviation accidents. This dataset contains 172 unique CVR transcripts (with 21,626 lines of transcript: averaging: 106.001 conversational turns; SD = 51.727, range: 1-641), and capturing approximately 15% of historic aviation fatalities in commercial and corporate aviation between 1962 and 2018. CVR transcripts involved airlines registered across 42 countries, with accidents occurring across 50 countries. The dataset was compiled by extracting CVR transcripts from three primary data sources and excluding duplicate and non-English entries. The data contains variables describing the i) raw data, ii) content and characteristics of the CVR transcripts, and iii) behaviours coded by research assistants in support of the associated research article. The data existed of conversational turns amongst flight crew (total = 19,393; within transcripts: m = 112.750; SD = 124.829) and other data (n = 2213; within transcripts: m = 12.866; SD = 14.452; e.g., background sounds, transcriber notes). Conversational turns were uttered by junior (39.00%) and senior (35.44%) flight crew, and others (25.56%). The dataset enables future research through providing the first integrated dataset on communication behaviours prior to historic aviation accidents. Moreover, the dataset may support safety management through enabling the identification of communication behaviours contributing to accidents and the design of novel interventions.

Discrete mode lasers for communication applications,"['Chloe Herbert', 'D. Jones', 'Aleksandra Kaszubowska[...]', ""J.

This device, called discrete mode (DM) laser, is basically a ridge waveguide Fabry-Perot (FP) laser, whose wavelength spectra has been modified to obtain a single mode operation. This is achieved by perturbing the effective refractive index of the guided mode along very small sections of the laser cavity, by etching features into the ridge waveguide. Suitable positioning of these interfaces allows the mirror loss spectrum of an FP laser to be manipulated in order to achieve single longitudinal mode emission. The waveguide structure requires only a single growth stage and uses optical lithography to realise the ridge. In addition, the fabrication process is re-growth free. Despite this simple and low cost fabrication process, the DM lasers portray many advantages over the distributed feedback and distributed Bragg reflector lasers, such as very high side mode suppression ratio, stable operation over a large temperature range, narrow linewidth and low sensitivity to optical feedback.",Article,9.0, IET Optoelectronics,,1,"

With competing funding trends requiring plans for public engagement in the funded research, a question arising is whether institutes capturing higher amounts of funding return the most value for public communication. Using international data from N = 1550 institutes in six countries, we first compare public communication activity among excellent and less-than-excellent institutes. We then investigate the relationship between competitive funding and public communication across levels of excellence. We find that the returns of funding are maximised in media interactions in excellent institutes when compared to the less excellent, but not in public events. This suggests that returns of research funding may not result in the expected outcomes for increased ‘public engagement in science’ if institutions are guided by instrumental goals.",Article,1.0, Humanities and Social Sciences Communications,Sep 22,1,"

"Science Cultures in a Diverse World: Knowing, Sharing, Caring","['Bernard Schiele', 'Xuan Liu', 'Martin W Bauer']","Science and technology culture is now more than ever at the very heart of the social project, and all countries, to varying degrees, participate in it: raising scientific literacy, improving the image of the sciences, involving the public in debates and encouraging the young to pursue careers in the sciences. Thus, the very destiny of any society is now entwined with its ability to develop a genuine science and technology culture, accessible for participation not only to the few who, by virtue of their training or trade, work in the science and technology fields, but to all, thereby creating occasions for society to debate and to foster a positive dialogue about the directions of change and future choices. This book organized on the theme of ‘knowing, sharing, caring: new insights for a diverse world’, which was derived from the observation that globalization rests upon diversity—diversity of contexts, publics, research, strategies and new innovating practices—and aims to stimulate exchanges, discussions and debates, to initiate a reflection conducive to decentring and to be an opportunity for enrichment by providing the reader with means to achieve the potentialities of that diversity through a comparison of the visions that underpin the attitudes of social actors, the challenges they perceive and the potential solutions they consider. Thus, this book aims first and foremost to raise questions in such a manner that readers so stimulated will feel compelled to contribute and will do so. In this spirit, however significant, the results presented and shared are less important than the questions they seek to answer: How are we to rethink the diffusion, the propagation and the sharing of scientific thought and knowledge in an ever more complex and diverse world?

Science Communication on Offer by Research Institutes in Eight Countries,['Marta Entradas'],"In this chapter, I offer some observations on the evolving communication functions of research universities in eight countries. I report on the MORE-PE: Mobilisation of Resources for Public Engagement with Science research project (2016–2020), which examined the public communication activity of institutes within research universities and large research institutions in Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy, the United States, Brazil and Japan. I call this the meso-level of the organizations, where the research action is located but for which we have little or no empirical data. I describe communications practices, target audiences and rationales for communication by research institutes with a focus on country comparisons and make use of the data to advance our understanding of how science communication is growing at the institute level across regions of the globe.",Chapter,,,Sep 15,0,"

"Attachment and politics are two functionally distinct systems, and both share genetics with interpersonal trust and altruism","['Thomas Haarklau Kleppestø', 'Nikolai Olavi Czajkowski', 'Olav Vassend[...]', 'Lotte Thomsen']","The evolved attachment system maintains proximity and care-giving behavior between parents and offspring, in a way that is argued to shape people’s mental models of how relationships work, resulting in secure, anxious or avoidant interpersonal styles. Several theorists have suggested that the attachment system is closely connected to orientations and behaviors in social and political domains, such that the latter are grounded in the same set of familial experiences as are the different attachment styles. We use a large sample of Norwegian twins (N = 1987) to assess the relationship between attachment styles and two key ideological orientations, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO), and the role of genetic and environmental influences therein. We also consider the relationship of both sets of traits with the interpersonal orientations of trust and altruism. Results indicate no shared environmental overlap between attachment and ideology, nor even between the two attachment styles or between the two ideological traits, challenging conventional wisdom in developmental, social, and political psychology. Rather, evidence supports two functionally distinct systems, one for navigating intimate relationships and one for navigating social hierarchies, with genetic overlap between traits within each system, and two distinct genetic linkages to trust and altruism. We argue for further genetically informed research in other settings to elucidate the etiology and dynamics of these core aspects of our social and political nature.",Preprint,,,Sep 4,0,"

Investigating public space exploration interest and support in the UK,"['Marta Entradas', 'Steven Miller']","Despite recent reports stressing that the UK should play a full role in robotic and human space exploration and that such involvement is crucial to engage society in the excitement of space discovery, the UK government keeps its longstanding opposition to participation in human space missions. Space agencies such as NASA and ESA have ambitious long-term programmes of science and discovery that mark the beginning of a new era in space exploration where humans will be sent to Mars; An era that requires public support and, therefore, more consideration for public opinion. This study shows that the British public who come to outreach and engagement activities consider the advancement of UK space activities nationally to be of interest. In 2008, over 700 Britons were surveyed at two space outreach events in the UK, the Royal Society Summer Exhibition in London and the National Space Centre in Leicester, to determine their attitudes to space exploration. When asked about means to explore space, the majority agreed that space should be explored both by mankind and machines, scoring ""generating new scientific knowledge and advance human culture"" as the most important reason for keeping exploring space. Although the greater number of supporters said that more money should be allocated to civil space activities, there were some concerns about risk and value. This paper will investigate the views and attitudes towards space exploration of this segment of the population and how it may relate to support for space exploration.",Article,,,Aug 20,0,"

The presence and potential impact of psychological safety in the healthcare setting: an evidence synthesis,"['Katherine Grailey', 'E. Murray', 'Tom W. Reader', 'S. J. Brett']","Introduction Psychological safety is the shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking. Its presence improves innovation and error prevention. This evidence synthesis had 3 objectives: explore the current literature regarding psychological safety, identify methods used in its assessment and investigate for evidence of consequences of a psychologically safe environment. Methods We searched multiple trial registries through December 2018. All studies addressing psychological safety within healthcare workers were included and reviewed for methodological limitations. A thematic analysis approach explored the presence of psychological safety. Content analysis was utilised to evaluate potential consequences. Results We included 62 papers from 19 countries. The thematic analysis demonstrated high and low levels of psychological safety both at the individual level in study participants and across the studies themselves. There was heterogeneity in responses across all studies, limiting generalisable conclusions about the overall presence of psychological safety. A wide range of methods were used. Twenty-five used qualitative methodology, predominantly semi-structured interviews. Thirty quantitative or mixed method studies used surveys. Ten studies inferred that low psychological safety negatively impacted patient safety. Nine demonstrated a significant relationship between psychological safety and team outcomes. The thematic analysis allowed the development of concepts beyond the content of the original studies. This analytical process provided a wealth of information regarding facilitators and barriers to psychological safety and the development of a

The sounds of safety silence: Interventions and temporal patterns unmute unique safety voice content in speech,"['Mark Noort', 'Tom W. Reader', 'Alex Gillespie']","Research shows that withholding safety concerns on encountering hazards-safety silence-is a critical contributor to accidents. Studies therefore aim to prevent accidental harm through interventions for reducing safety silence. Yet, the behaviour remains poorly understood, obstructing effective safety management: it is unclear to what extent safety silence involves muted safety voice (the partial withholding of safety concerns), and how muted safety voice can be recognised in speech, may be measured based on the degrees and types of safety voice (speaking up about safety), progresses over time, and may be optimally reduced. To improve safety management, this study proposes a conceptual model for the manifestation of safety silence and muted safety voice using a laboratory experiment (N = 404) to evaluate the implications for the effectiveness of three interventions (salient hazards, clear responsibilities, encouragements) across stages of a hazard. Results indicated that safety silence and muted safety voice are measurable in terms of the degree to which concerned people engage in five types of safety voice at different points in time, and we revealed this is important for safety management: interventions only unmute safety voice at unique hazard stages and for knowledge-based speech when people are concerned. This indicates that safety silence and muted safety voice are situated and can be recognised in nuanced speech, with interventions being most effective when timed appropriately and people have safety concerns to speak up about.",Article,1.0, Safety Science,Aug 1,1,"

Intensivists’ beliefs about rapid multiplex molecular diagnostic testing and its potential role in improving prescribing decisions and antimicrobial stewardship: a qualitative study,"['Alyssa M. Pandolfo', 'Robert Horne', 'Yogini Jani[...]', 'Suveer Singh']","Background Rapid molecular diagnostic tests to investigate the microbial aetiology of pneumonias may improve treatment and antimicrobial stewardship in intensive care units (ICUs). Clinicians’ endorsement and uptake of these tests is crucial to maximise engagement; however, adoption may be impeded if users harbour unaddressed concerns or if device usage is incompatible with local practice. Accordingly, we strove to identify ICU clinicians’ beliefs about molecular diagnostic tests for pneumonias before implementation at the point-of-care. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with 35 critical care doctors working in four ICUs in the United Kingdom. A clinical vignette depicting a fictitious patient with signs of pneumonia was used to explore clinicians’ beliefs about the importance of molecular diagnostics and their concerns. Data were analysed thematically. Results Clinicians’ beliefs about molecular tests could be grouped into two categories: perceived potential of molecular diagnostics to improve antibiotic prescribing (Molecular Diagnostic Necessity) and concerns about how the test results could be implemented into practice (Molecular Diagnostic Concerns). Molecular Diagnostic Necessity stemmed from beliefs that positive results would facilitate targeted antimicrobial therapy; that negative results would signal the absence of a pathogen, and consequently that having the molecular diagnostic results would bolster clinicians’ prescribing confidence. Molecular Diagnostic Concerns included unfamiliarity with the device’s capabilities, worry that it would detect non-pathogenic bacteria, uncertainty whether it would fail to detect pathogens, and discomfort with withholding antibiotics until receiving mo

Organising for disruptive innovation: everyday entrepreneuring efforts at an incumbent technology company,['Lisa Whitelaw'],"In an age of disruptions leading organisations need to embrace new ways of working to maintain their competitive advantage. Yet how to do so within the constraints of established business practices remains unclear. In a longitudinal ethnographic case study I investigated in real-time over a period of three years an incumbent organisation’s efforts to organise for disruptive innovation from an organisation-creation perspective. Using a processual, practice-based, engaged scholarship approach, I followed the situated development of six potentially disruptive innovation projects on-the-ground as they unfolded at Thales UK, a leading multinational technology company. As a full member of Thales UK Research, Technology and Innovation (RTI), I observed and contributed directly to the company’s efforts to organise for disruptive innovation from an insider account. I show how the company’s efforts to organise for disruptive innovation interrupted organisational members’ collectively held practical understandings of their work, illuminate how the established organisational arrangement is used in everyday performative efforts to organise for disruptive innovation, and illustrate how the entrepreneurial development of disruptive opportunities over time is both shaped by and impacts on the organisational context they develop within. In a confessional tale I share my experience of studying and contributing to the company’s efforts to organise for disruptive innovation in real-time as a toolkit for other researchers to engage in similar scholar-practitioner collaborative research arrangements. I draw together my findings in a process model of organising for disruptive innovation in an incumbent organisation. I contribute to the

Getting the whole story: Integrating patient complaints and staff reports of unsafe care,"['Jackie van Dael', 'Alex Gillespie', 'Tom W. Reader[...]', 'Erik Mayer']","Objective It is increasingly recognized that patient safety requires heterogeneous insights from a range of stakeholders, yet incident reporting systems in health care still primarily rely on staff perspectives. This paper examines the potential of combining insights from patient complaints and staff incident reports for a more comprehensive understanding of the causes and severity of harm. Methods Using five years of patient complaints and staff incident reporting data at a large multi-site hospital in London (in the United Kingdom), this study conducted retrospective patient-level data linkage to identify overlapping reports. Using a combination of quantitative coding and in-depth qualitative analysis, we then compared level of harm reported, identified descriptions of adjacent events missed by the other party and examined combined narratives of mutually identified events. Results Incidents where complaints and incident reports overlapped (n = 446, reported in 7.6%’ of all complaints and 0.6% of all incident reports) represented a small but critical area of investigation, with significantly higher rates of Serious Incidents and severe harm. Linked complaints described greater harm from safety incidents in 60% of cases, reported many surrounding safety events missed by staff (n = 582), and provided contesting stories of why problems occurred in 46% cases, and complementary accounts in 26% cases. Conclusions This study demonstrates the value of using patient complaints to supplement, test, and challenge staff reports, including to provide greater insight on the many potential factors that may give rise to unsafe care. Accordingly, we propose that a more holistic analysis of critical safety incidents can be achieved through combining heterogeneo

Safety voice and safety listening during aviation accidents: Cockpit voice recordings reveal that speaking-up to power is not enough,"['Mark Noort', 'Tom W. Reader', 'Alex Gillespie']","Safety voice is theorised as an important factor for mitigating accidents, but behavioural research during actual hazards has been scant. Research indicates power distance and poor listening to safety concerns (safety listening) suppresses safety voice. Yet, despite fruitful hypotheses and training programs, data is based on imagined and simulated scenarios and it remains unclear to what extent speaking-up poses a genuine problem for safety management, how negative responses shape the behaviour, or how this can be explained by power distance. Moreover, this means it remains unclear how the concept of safety voice is relevant for understanding accidents. To address this, 172 Cockpit Voice Recorder transcripts of historic aviation accidents were identified, integrated into a novel dataset (n = 14,128 conversational turns), coded in terms of safety voice and safety listening and triangulated with Hofstede’s power distance. Results revealed that flight crew spoke-up in all but two accidents, provided the first direct evidence that power distance and safety listening explain variation in safety voice during accidents, and indicated partial effectiveness of CRM training programs because safety voice and safety listening changed over the course of history, but only for low power distance environments. Thus, findings imply that accidents cannot be assumed to emerge from a lack of safety voice, or that the behaviour is sufficient for avoiding harm, and indicate a need for improving interventions across environments. Findings underscore that the literature should be grounded in real accidents and make safety voice more effective through improving ‘safety listening’.",Article,1.0, Safety Science,Jul 1,0,"

Understanding decisions about antibiotic prescribing in ICU: an application of the Necessity Concerns Framework,"['Alyssa M Pandolfo', 'Robert Horne', 'Yogini Jani[...]', 'Stephen J Brett']","Background Antibiotics are extensively prescribed in intensive care units (ICUs), yet little is known about how antibiotic-related decisions are made in this setting. We explored how beliefs, perceptions and contextual factors influenced ICU clinicians’ antibiotic prescribing. Methods We conducted 4 focus groups and 34 semistructured interviews with clinicians involved in antibiotic prescribing in four English ICUs. Focus groups explored factors influencing prescribing, whereas interviews examined decision-making processes using two clinical vignettes. Data were analysed using thematic analysis, applying the Necessity Concerns Framework. Results Clinicians’ antibiotic decisions were influenced by their judgement of the necessity for prescribing/not prescribing, relative to their concerns about potential adverse consequences. Antibiotic necessity perceptions were strongly influenced by beliefs that antibiotics would protect patients from deterioration and themselves from the ethical and legal consequences of undertreatment. Clinicians also reported concerns about prescribing antibiotics. These generally centred on antimicrobial resistance; however, protecting the individual patient was prioritised over these societal concerns. Few participants identified antibiotic toxicity concerns as a key influencer. Clinical uncertainty often complicated balancing antibiotic necessity against concerns. Decisions to start or continue antibiotics often represented ‘erring on the side of caution’ as a protective response in uncertainty. This approach was reinforced by previous experiences of negative consequences (‘being burnt’) which motivated prescribing ‘just in case’ of an infection. Prescribing decisions were also

Reader', 'Alex Gillespie']","Transcribed text from simulated hazards contains important content relevant for preventing harm. By capturing and analysing the content of speech when people raise (safety voice) or withhold safety concerns (safety silence), communication patterns may be identified for when individuals perceive risk, and safety management may be improved through identifying potential antecedents. This dataset contains transcribed speech from 404 participants (nstudents = 377; nfemale = 277, Age M(sd) = 22.897(5.386)) engaged in a simulated hazardous scenario (walking across an unsafe plank), capturing 18,078 English words (M(sd) = 46.117(37.559)). The data was collected through the Walking the plank paradigm (Noort et al, 2019), which provides a validated laboratory experiment designed for the direct observation of communication in response to hazardous scenarios that elicit safety concerns. Three manipulations were included in the design: hazard salience (salient vs not salient), responsibilities (clear vs diffuse) and encouragements (encouraged vs discouraged).

Transnational Labour Solidarity as Transformative Practice: Reframing the Role of Labour Transnationalism,['Katherine Nastovski'],"In the 1980s and 1990s, a significant number of rank-and-file trade union activists in Canada became actively engaged in various forms of international labour solidarity. This activity, the end of the Cold War and the increasing impacts of neo-liberal globalisation combined to spark hopes for greatly expanding practices of labour transnationalism. This vision of transnationalising trade union organisation has not materialised and, in fact, inside Canadian unions there has been declining faith in the possibilities of building transnational solidarity. Starting with an analysis of the dominant dichotomies underlying the literature on labour transnationalism, I suggest that stepping outside these dichotomies can provide a different way of assessing the role of transnational labour solidarity within broader struggles for workers’ justice. In this article, drawing upon the case of transnational political solidarities built by workers inside Canadian unions in the 1980s and 1990s, I argue that assessing transnational practices with a longer view to class formation and the goals of workers’ emancipation can help to expand conceptions of what constitutes successful transnational practice. Such a reassessment of the role of labour transnationalism is particularly timely in the current context of right-wing populism.",Article,1.0, Global Labour Journal,,0,"

We argue women exercise “tactic agency” in captivity in ways that are, taken together, “law‐making” in their contestations over the socio‐legal categories of marriage. Their contestations of marriage impact the norms within rebel groups as well as the development of new crimes against humanity in international criminal law.

"Place, power, difference: Multiscale research at the dawn of the twenty-first century","['L.L. Gezon', 'Sydney Paulson']","Innovations and debates within political ecology, as well as critiques of the approach as a whole, have motivated serious reflection about the methods, concepts, and studies that make up this relatively new field. As environmental issues become increasingly prominent in local struggles, national debates, and international policies, scholars are paying more attention to conventional politics and to more broadly defined relations of power and difference in interactions among human groups and their biophysical environments. This move has generated questions about the role of politics in environmental scholarship and practice as well as concerns that ardent attention to political phenomena may leave ecological detail in the shadows. In efforts to work more closely with political, economic, and ecological concerns and phenomena, political ecologists have pursued several promising paths: they have looked beyond the local community to explain natural resource use, explored power dynamics in everyday interactions and formal policy arenas, and paid increasing attention to the environmental interests, knowledge, and practices of social groups differentiated by race, ethnicity, gender, or other factors. © 2005 by Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.

Locating the Political in Political Ecology: An Introduction,"['Sydney Paulson', 'Lisa L.

In the introduction to this special issue, we briefly chart the intellectual genealogy of political ecology, identify vital challenges faced today, and present a new set of studies that respond to these concerns. We conceptualize power as a social relation built on the asymmetrical distribution of resources and risks and locate power in the interactions among, and the processes that constitute, people, places, and resources. Politics, then, are found in the practices and mechanisms through which such power is circulated. The focus here is on politics related to the environment, understood as biophysical phenomena, together with human knowledge and practice. To apply these concepts, we promote multiscale research models that articulate selected ecological phenomena and local social processes, together with regional and global forces and ideas. We also advocate methods for research and practice that are sensitive to relations of difference and power among and within social groups. Rather than dilute ecological dimensions of study, this approach aims to strengthen our ability to account for the dialectical processes through which humans appropriate, contest, and manipulate the world around them.",Article,3.0, Human Organization,,0,"

These samples were assessed for population genetic parameters that impact forensic statistical calculations. All population samples were highly polymorphic for the 16 Y STR markers with the marker DYS385 being the most polymorphic, because it is comprised of two loci. Most (2677 out of a total of 2806 distinct haplotypes) of the 16 marker haplotypes observed in the sample populations were represented only once in the data set. Haplotype diversities were greater than 99.57% for the Chinese, Malay, Thai, Japanese, and Indian sample populations. For the Y STR markers, population substructure correction was considered when calculating the rarity of a Y STR profile. An F(ST) value, rather than a R(ST) value, is more appropriate under a forensic model. Because the F(ST) values are very small within the Asian populations, the estimate of the rarity of a haplotype comprised of 10-16 markers does not need substructure correction. However haplotypes with fewer markers may require F(ST) corrections when calculating the rarity of the profile.",Article,8.0, Legal Medicine,Nov 17,0,"

The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and local institutions in Ghana’s mining communities: Challenges in understanding barriers to accountability,"['Hevina S.

Despite improvements in the subnational disclosure of royalty payments, a significant problem is the failure of these efforts to improve accountability and benefits to mining communities. Purpose The article asks how institutions of local governance affect national efforts to improve accountability to mining communities in Ghana on the use of mineral revenues for development. It contributes to the broader theoretical literature on EITI by clarifying what outcomes, if any, can be directly attributed to the disclosure of royalty payments. Methods and approach This qualitative study employs a case-study analysis of EITI adoption in Ghana, one of the first countries to join the initiative. The article contextualizes local governance institutions and dynamics in relation to the royalty disbursement process. It draws on original field research to analyse their role in impeding the expected benefits of royalty disbursements to mining-affected communities. Findings The research identifies deficiencies in local governance structures and processes as they relate to the use of mineral royalties, but also instances of variation in how officials react to EITI. The range of individual actors, institutions and complex processes on which the subnational disbursement of royalties depends, makes it problematic to attribute the absence of improvements directly to Ghana’s EITI. The findings demonstrate that EITI’s role in participating countries is best understood as facilitative and indirect when addressing development outcomes for mining commu

Introduction to climate justice communication (in Research Handbook on Communicating Climate Change),"['Anna Roosvall', 'Matthew Tegelberg']","Theme VIII.

Both chapters discuss the situations of Indigenous peoples and illuminate challenges of communicating climate justice across diverse communicational and geographical contexts. Roosvall and Tegelberg (Chapter 22) detail how attention to economic, cultural, and political justice must be combined with attention to geographical scope, suggesting that future research consider how geographical scales are combined or disconnected in climate change reporting for diverse types of media. In Chapter 23, Yagodin applies a pluralistic climate justice approach, which includes justice for nature, and zooms in on Russian climate change reporting. He examines how calls for climate justice were largely excluded from journalistic, but not NGO, framings of the 2016 anthrax outbreak on the Yamal peninsula. Together, these contributions highlight possibilities and challenges for justly communicating about climate justice.

"“Let’s Not Have the Perfect Be the Enemy of the Good”: Social Impact Bonds, Randomized Controlled Trials, and the Valuation of Social Programs",['James Williams'],"This article uses the case of “social impact bonds” (SIBs) to explore the role of social science methods in new markets in “social investment.” Pioneered in the UK in 2010, SIBs use private capital to fund social programs with governments paying returns for successful outcomes. Central to the SIB model is the question of evaluation and the method to be used in determining program outcomes and investor returns. In the United States, the randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been the dominant method. However, this has not been without controversy. Some SIB practitioners and investors have argued that, while this may be the perfect tool, the need to grow the SIB market demands a more pragmatic approach. Drawing from a three-year study of SIBs, and informed by Science and Technology Studies (STS)-inspired work on valuation and the social life of methods, the article explores RCTs as both a valuation technology central to SIB design and the object of a micropolitics of valuation which has impeded market growth. It is the relationship between, and the politics of, evaluation and valuation that is a key lesson of the SIB experiment and an important insight for future research on “social investment” and other settings where methods are constitutive of financial value.",Article,1.0," Science, Technology & Human Values",Oct 12,0,"

Formalizing Secularism as a Regime of Restrictions and Protections: The Case of Quebec (Canada) and Geneva (Switzerland),['Amelie Barras'],"In 2019, the province of Quebec and the canton of Geneva passed bills establishing their states as “secular.” While each law is, to a certain extent, context specific, both present noteworthy similarities. First, neutrality (the cornerstone of laïcité ) is articulated around two elements: (1) restrictions that affect the religious practices of public servants belonging to minority religions and (2) protections for Christian symbols constructed as “cultural.” The article questions the implications for inclusive citizenship of formalizing regulatory regimes that differentiate between “religion” and “culture.” Second, a comparative lens enables an analysis of how, through whom, and why similar regimes of regulation travel from one area of the world to another. The article argues for the importance of considering transnational influences when analyzing the regulation of religion to better (1) understand why particular models of secularism gain traction and (2) capture power dynamics structuring these processes of traction.",Article,1.0, Canadian journal of law and society = Revue canadienne de droit et société,Oct 9,0,"

Violencia política en los márgenes del Estado: Autonomía comunitaria afro-indígena en la Costa Atlántica de Nicaragua,"['Maria Dolores Figueroa Romero', 'Miguel Gonzalez']","RESUMEN Basado en una perspectiva descolonial de los márgenes del Estado y las geografías racializadas, este ensayo ofrece un análisis del proyecto revolucionario integracionista hacia la Costa Atlántica. El texto revela los efectos racistas y discriminatorios de la construcción de Nicaragua como una nación mestizo-hispano hablante, inscritos en las políticas civilizatorias sandinistas a lo largo de varios períodos históricos. Los ejes de análisis se enfocan en (1) la racialización de lo indígena y la violencia política en la guerra durante los años 1980s en la Costa, (2) la recomposición de lo comunitario y la autonomía de los pueblos versus la autonomía institucional regional instaurada durante los 1990s, y (3) la línea divisoria por géneros de la resistencia comunitaria y territorial a la violencia y el desplazamiento experimentado en la última década. De esta forma, el artículo descentra el discurso autonomista oficialista y el nacionalismo nicaragüense para hacer presente los bordes disruptivos desde donde se formulan imaginarios políticos y órdenes de legalidad y soberanía alternativos a los confines delineados por las formaciones estatales.",Article,1.0, Canadian journal of Latin American and Caribbean studies = Revue canadienne des études latino-américaines et caraïbes,Sep 29,0,"

Life after trafficking: reintegration experiences of human trafficking survivors in Nigeria,"['Uwafiokun Idemudia', 'Nnenna Okoli', 'Mary Goitom', 'Sylvia Bawa']","Purpose Reintegration programs have emerged as part of the regimes of care for survivors of human trafficking. However, empirical analysis of the reintegration outcomes for survivors remains limited in the African context. Hence, this paper aims to examine the challenges and opportunities of reintegration assistance programs for survivors of human trafficking in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on qualitative methods of data collection and analysis, this study conducted semi-structured interviews with repatriated women who have accessed reintegration assistance in Nigeria, and data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings The findings suggest that while the reintegration programs might address the procedural aspect of reintegration, the achievement of substantive reintegration remains incomplete. This is because of the structural conditions of the context within which reintegration is supposed to occur. Practical implications There is a need to take seriously the distinction between the reintegration of survivors into a new community or a former community in the design of a regime of care for survivors of human trafficking in Africa. Crucially, the focus on procedural reintegration should not also divert attention away from the structural conditions and reforms needed to ensure survivors achieve substantive reintegration. Originality/value This paper contributes to the limited literature on life after trafficking and demonstrates the strengths and limitations of reintegration programs as a regime of care for survivors of human trafficking. In addition, this study empirically grounded the theoretical distinction between different aspects of the process of reintegration.",Article,1.0," International Journal of Migration, Health and Social Care",Sep 15,0,"

The Role of the State in Corporate Social Responsibility: The Case of the Zambian Mining Sector,"['Elisavet Mantzari', 'Obby Phiri', 'Uwafiokun Idemudia']","Literature has not sufficiently explored the role of the state in corporate social responsibility (CSR), or has tended to focus on the state’s role as a regulator in the context of developed countries. This paper explores the shifting role of the state in CSR, and the way the features of a state affect CSR in the context of a developing country. The paper adopts a strategic-relational approach that recognises the variability in state capacities over time and space. Empirically, it draws upon secondary sources and interviews with stakeholder groups. Our findings reveal the complex nature of CSR and the dynamic, yet resilient, role of state actors in a context of strong state–business interdependence, institutional incompatibility, and fragmented powers across diverse state branches. While the state (re)claims control over CSR when its socio-economic goals are challenged, it tends to move from emphasising state control to co-ordinating complex modes of CSR governance.",Conference Paper,,,Aug 13,0,"

Contemporary slavery: The rhetoric of global human rights campaigns,"['Annie Bunting', 'J. Quirk']","This volume brings together a cast of leading experts to carefully explore how the history and iconography of slavery has been invoked to support a series of government interventions, activist projects, legal instruments, and rhetorical performances. However well-intentioned these interventions might be, they nonetheless remain subject to a host of limitations and complications. Recent efforts to combat contemporary slavery are too often sensationalist, self-serving, and superficial and, therefore, end up failing the crucial test of speaking truth to power. The widely held notion that antislavery is one of those rare issues that ""transcends"" politics or ideology is only sustainable because the underlying issues at stake have been constructed and demarcated in a way that minimizes direct challenges to dominant political and economic interests. This must change. By providing an original approach to the underlying issues at stake, Contemporary Slavery will help readers understand the political practices that have been concealed beneath the popular rhetoric and establishes new conversations between scholars of slavery and trafficking and scholars of human rights and social movements.",Book,,,Aug 2,0,"

Can “the oven bird” Migrate North of the border?,['Annie Bunting'],"In David Engel’s elegant 1984 piece “The Oven Bird’s Song: Insiders, Outsiders, and Personal Injuries in an American Community, he documents legal perceptions of residents of the pseudonymous Sander County, Illinois that were disconnected from the legal realities he measured, and concluded that these perceptions were reactions to social change that produced greater pluralism in the community. This gave rise to “symbolic efforts … to preserve a sense of meaning and coherence in the face of social changes that they found threatening and confusing. Residents sought to “recall and reaffirm an untainted world that existed nowhere but in their imaginations. These conclusions are fascinating and prescient, and have led many of us since then to probe legal perceptions in the face of growing normative pluralism. Much like the study of residents of Sander County in Engel’s “Oven Bird’s Song, Carole Greenhouse writes about perceptions of disputes and litigation in a small town she calls Hopewell in Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town (1986). In Greenhouse’s preface, she discusses her own assumptions going into her study. She writes: I went to Hopewell in September 1973 to study dispute settlement in an American community, and my assumption, or hope, was that the role of the court in the social fabric of a town would be thrown into relief if the community was in the process of change. The rest of the book should make it clear why such a legal study was not possible in this community and also how it is that one can begin a study of an American community by looking for conflict and end by considering a person’s relationship to God.

Humanitarian and Human Rights Surveillance: The Challenge to Border Surveillance and Invisibility?,['Ozgun Topak'],"The European border regime has traditionally rested on the hidden surveillance activities of border authorities, which have contributed to human rights violations (including “push-back” and “left-to-die” practices) and a rising migrant death toll. Recently a number of humanitarian and activist organizations, including Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Sea-Watch, and WatchTheMed, have organized to aid migrants in distress at sea using surveillance technologies, ranging from drones to GPS. By doing so, they presented a challenge to the European border surveillance regime. In dialogue with the concept of countersurveillance, this paper introduces the concepts of humanitarian surveillance and human rights surveillance and deploys them to examine and categorize the activities of MOAS, MSF, Sea-Watch, and WatchTheMed. Humanitarian surveillance narrowly focuses on aiding victims of surveillance without problematizing the logic and hierarchies of surveillance, while human rights surveillance operates as a form of countersurveillance; it aims to protect and advance the human rights of victims of surveillance and expose human rights violations committed by authorities through opposing the hierarchies of surveillance. The paper shows how civilian groups incorporate elements of humanitarian and human rights surveillance in their activities at varying levels and discusses the extent to which they challenge the European border surveillance regime.",Article,9.0, Surveillance & Society,Jul 15,0,"

"Migrant protest in times of crisis: politics, ethics and the sacred from below",['Ozgun Topak'],"This paper focuses on the 300 Migrant Hunger Strikers event in Greece to explore the material conditions of possibility for migrant politics in times of crisis. It identifies three elements that played determinant roles in the articulation of the event: the politics of equality enacted by migrants, the ethics of hospitality and witnessing enacted by the Greek activists and host populations and the sacredness of the event. Critically engaging with the theories of Rancière, Derrida, Agamben and Durkheim, this paper demonstrates how these elements encountered and how their encounter helped migrants to achieve rights, albeit limited and temporary. Moving beyond the particularity of the event, this paper also highlights the event’s importance for migrant politics in times of austerity, and increased surveillance and racism against migrants. Despite its limited and temporary success, the event demonstrates how a politics of equality, ethical openness and respect for human life can form the basis of true cosmopolitan universality. The event also demonstrates how cosmopolitan universality is constructed from below by the migrants, who despite their undocumented status, engaged in an act of citizenship to demand equality.",Article,6.0, Citizenship Studies,,0,"

The New Borders of the European Union: Digital Surveillance and Social Sorting,['Ozgun Topak'],"n this paper the emergence of the digital borders in the EU is analyzed. Alt- hough borders have always been the spaces where individuals are sorted from each other, the database technologies extend this process of sorting to every- where within the EU. The developments in the database and biometrics technology have made it possible to identify people automatically and to reach their records even long after they have entered the EU. Digitization and diffusion of the borders will affect the already disadvantaged segments of the population, such as undocumented migrants, asylum seekers and ordinary travellers, in a negative way. These categories are now put under continual surveillance as if they are potential criminals or terrorists. Yet, the diffusion of the borders with digital technologies should not mean that the localized controls at the external borders have lost their significance. In fact, with the EUROSUR, now the territorial controls have also intensified. The EUROSUR will survey the external EU borders with sophisticated surveillance systems, including manned and un- manned aerial vehicles and satellites, in order prevent irregular migrants from reaching the EU. This paper is divided into three main sections. In the discussion that follows, the paper draws on the surveillance and border studies literature to develop a con- ceptual framework for understanding the digital borders. Second, the paper ex- amines the new EU surveillance mechanisms in detail and their effects on dif- ferent groups. The final section concludes by summarizing the arguments of the paper and discussing the consequences of digital sorting on European citizenship.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Biopolitical Violence and Waiting: Hotspot as a Biopolitical Borderzone,['Ozgun Topak'],"This paper conceptualises Lesvos hotspot as a biopolitical borderzone where migrants experience concentrated violent practices of borders, including legal exclusion, presence of exclusionary surveillance and absence of surveillance for safety, degrading living conditions, and waiting. The paper also discusses the biopolitical consequences of these practices for migrants such as physical illnesses and injuries, and psychological disorders. The paper contributes to the scholarship on biopolitical borders in two main ways. First, through conceptualising hotspot as a form of biopolitical borderzone and demonstrating the specific biopolitical practices in the Lesvos hotspot and their effects on migrants. Second, through highlighting the key role of waiting in the operations of the biopolitical border. The paper demonstrates how waiting is entangled in a complex way with other biopolitical practices and how it both creates and amplifies biopolitical effects for migrants.",Article,0.0, Antipode,Jul 15,0,"

"Solar Home Systems in South Asia: Examining Adoption, Energy Consumption, and Social Practices",['Nathanael Ojong'],"Renewable electricity generation from solar energy has rapidly increased in South Asia. This paper presents a systematic review of 79 scholarly papers on the topic of solar home system adoption, energy consumption, and social practices in South Asia. Using an intersectionality lens, the paper demonstrates that various categories of difference, such as gender, age, class, and ethnicity, intersect and shape the adoption of this technology in South Asia. Utilizing a social practice theory lens, the paper shows that solar home systems shape the spatial and temporal arrangements and practices of members of households that have adopted the technology, as well as their counterparts who have not. This technology has a practical but also symbolic function; the symbolic function and social meaning are derived from the economic and socio-cultural contexts. As this renewable energy technology is embedded in economic and socio-cultural contexts, people reconfigure it in creative ways to meet their everyday energy needs.

Drawing from research on SIBs in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, the paper explores this effort to turn (re)offending into an investment, its challenges and how SIBs reveal a financial ‘style of reasoning’ that is re-shaping the ‘culture of crime control’ with critical implications for providers, programs and participants.",Article,1.0, British Journal of Criminology,Jul 6,0,"

Heterogeneous Combustion of Porous Graphite Particles in Normal and Microgravity,"['Harsha Chelliah', 'Fletcher Miller', 'David Pantano', 'Aslan Kasimov']","Combustion of solid fuel particles has many important applications, including power generation and space propulsion systems. The current models available for describing the combustion process of these particles, especially porous solid particles, include various simplifying approximations. One of the most limiting approximations is the lumping of the physical properties of the porous fuel with the heterogeneous chemical reaction rate constants. The primary objective of the present work is to develop a rigorous model that could decouple such physical and chemical effects from the global heterogeneous reaction rates. For the purpose of validating this model, experiments with porous graphite particles of varying sizes and porosity are being performed at NASA Lewis Research Center. The details of the experimental and theoretical model development effort are described.",Article,,,Jul 5,0,"

I critically compare and assess the campaign against South African apartheid in the 1980s and the more recent efforts to oppose Israeli apartheid. Both campaigns are examples of grassroots international labor solidarity, where organizers sought to build international solidarity through member mobilization and a focus on the power of workers to engage in solidarity actions. I examine how these union activists organized within their unions, and how their organizational differences and the ideological and political contexts they organized within shaped their successes and limitations. Drawing from the work of Antonio Gramsci, I argue that these campaigns were sites of counter-hegemonic practice both because of the analysis and critiques they offered but also because of the nature of their organizing.",Article,4.0, WorkingUSA,,0,"

Towards a framework for ethical innovation in children’s social care,"['Martha Hampson', 'Carlie Goldsmith', 'Michelle Lefevre']","Purpose Substantial government investment has accelerated innovation activity in children’s social care in England over the past decade. Ethical concerns emerge when innovation seems to be propelled by a drive for efficiency and over-reliance on process output indicators, as well as, or even instead of, improving the lives of children, families and societies. No ethical framework exists at present to act as a check on such drivers. This paper reviews the literature with the aim of considering how best to address this gap. Design/methodology/approach This paper draws on a review of innovation in children’s social care, conducted as part of an Economic and Social Research Council-funded project exploring innovation in services for young people exposed to extra-familial risk and harm. Findings This study proposes a new conception of “trustworthy innovation” for the sector that holds innovation in children’s social care to the standards and principles of the code of ethics for social work. This study offers an ethical framework, informed by the interdisciplinary school of organisational ethics, to operationalise this extended definition; the analytic framework guides policymakers and the practice sector to question at every stage of the innovation process whether a particular model is ethically appropriate, as well as practically feasible within a specific context. Implications for local decision-making and national policy are set out, alongside questions raised for future research.

Considerations in the use of local and national data for evaluating innovation in children’s social care,"['Oli Preston', 'Rebecca Godar', 'Michelle Lefevre[...]', 'Carlene Firmin']","Purpose This paper aims to explore the possibilities in using such national, statutory data sets for evaluating change and the challenges of understanding service patterns and outcomes in complex cases when only a limited view can be gained using existing data. The discussion also explores how methodologies can adapt to an evaluation in these circumstances. Design/methodology/approach This paper examines the use of data routinely collected by local authorities (LAs) as part of the evaluation of innovation. Issues entailed are discussed and illustrated through two case studies of evaluations conducted by the research team within the context of children’s social care in England. Findings The quantitative analysis of LA data can play an important role in evaluating innovation but researchers will need to address challenges related to: selection of a suitable methodology; identifying appropriate comparator data; accessing data and assessing its quality; and sustaining and increasing the value of analytic work beyond the end of the research. Examples are provided of how the two case studies experienced and addressed these challenges. Research limitations/implications • Quasi-experimental methods can be beneficial tools for understanding the impact of innovation in children’s services, but researchers should also consider the complexity of children’s social care and the use of mixed and appropriate methods. • Those funding innovative practice should consider the additional burden on those working with data and the related data infrastructure if wishing to document and analyse innovation in a robust way. • Data,

#socialwork: An International Study Examining Social Workers’ Use of Information and Communication Technology,"['Faye Mishna', 'Jane Elizabeth Sanders', 'Joanne Daciuk[...]', 'Michelle Lefevre']","Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) permeated social work practice before coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition to ICT-based formal services (e.g. e-counselling), social workers used ICTs informally as an adjunct to face-to-face practice. Building on our previous research, our cross-sectional online survey examined social workers’ informal use of ICTs in four countries: Canada, the USA, Israel and the UK. The survey was administered through Qualtrics software among social workers across Canada (n = 2,609), the USA (n = 1,225), Israel (n = 386) and the UK (n = 134), and analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 26. The findings substantiate the ubiquitous use of informal ICTs in social work practice, as an adjunct to face-to-face treatment, across the four countries. Given the current, unprecedented context of COVID-19, we discuss the meaning of our findings related to access, ethical considerations (e.g. professional boundaries) and supervision in the context of restricted face-to-face practice. We discuss the implications for social work practice, education and research, and conclude that in the COVID-19 context, there is an even greater need for research, clinical discussion, supervision and policy on informal ICT use in social work practice.",Article,1.0, British Journal of Social Work,,0,"

Securing lands in peri-urban zones: Land guards and insecurity in the Awutu Traditional Area of Ghana,"['Kaderi Noagah Bukari', 'Shaibu Bukari']","The quest for land in Ghana has resulted in multiple claims to land, led to violent land conflicts and intensified chieftaincy conflicts. It has also led to private land owners and developers employing the services of land guards as means of securing and protecting their lands. These land guards, who are often armed, attack rival groups thereby endangering the lives of residents. This study is about how rival chieftaincy groups, in their quest to own and control land, use land guards to lay claims to land. We collected data through interviews, focus group discussion and media reports. The content analysis method was used to examine data for the complexities involved in how the contest for chieftaincy and the control over land fuel the activities of land guards and therefore creates insecurity in the Awutu Traditional Area. The study involved police officers, claimants to the Awutu stool, elders of the area, land guards and community residents. The study found that the activities of land guards in the Awutu Traditional Area have intensified following rival claims to chieftaincy in some parts of the Awutu Traditional Area. Various claimants to stools are using the services of land guards as a way of controlling land because one’s ascendancy to the stool is a guarantee to controlling land. Also, increase in value of land for commercial and residential purposes in the area has intensified claims to the stool. We further found that the engagement of the services of land guards by rival claimants to the stool has escalated violence and resulted in the acquisition of sophisticated arms by various land guards to fight and defend their grasp over the land.

Towards sustainable peace in Ghana: Essays in Memory of Francis Kojo Azuimah,"['Kaderi Noagah Bukari', 'S. B. Kendie', 'Patrick osei-kufuor', 'Shaibu Bukari']","This book was conceived as a testament to the life and times of Mr. Francis Kojo Azuimah – the first Executive Secretary of the National Peace Council (NPC) of Ghana. The late Executive Secretary worked tirelessly not only to pre-empt and manage conflicts, but also drew attention of policy makers to the underlying causes of conflict. Consequently, in all the peacebuilding efforts that the NPC engaged in during his tenure, the fundamental issues of poverty, inequality and justice were driving concerns. The chapters in this book were written mainly by academics with several years and decades of research and practice in the fields of Peace Studies, Conflict Management and Development Studies. The authors draw attention to local, regional and national attempts at managing conflicts and peacebuilding and underline the essential roles of justice and stakeholder participation as ingredients to achieve sustainable peace.

"Canadian Journal of African Studies / Revue canadienne des études africaines ISSN: (Print) ( Market women's informal peacebuilding efforts in Ekumfi-Narkwa, Ghana","['Shaibu Bukari', 'Kaderi Noagah Bukari', 'Richard Ametefe']","This study examines market women’s participation in peacebuilding in the Ekumfi-Narkwa community in the Central Region of Ghana. In peacebuilding, women are often considered victims and passive targets for aid, rather than contributors to the process. Many studies and peacebuilders have neglected the critical role played by women in the informal sector in peacebuilding, especially at the local level. This study examines how local women help build everyday peace in their community through informal means. Twenty women and four men were purposively selected and interviewed. The results show that women in the informal sector draw on bonding and bridging social capital to improve peacebuilding processes in their community. Although the women studied were not well organised and did not have much formal education, they were able to contribute to peace in their community by creating and using informal social networks/bonds. We argue that women’s societal positions are aspects of social capital that make women agents of “everyday peace” who mobilise to aid informal peacebuilding efforts in the community. However, their efforts are not being recognised and supported in organising peacebuilding activities, especially during conflict.",Article,1.0, Canadian Journal of African Studies,Aug 16,1,"

Chieftaincy Conflicts in Northern Ghana: A Constellation of Actors and Politics,"['Kaderi Noagah Bukari', 'Patrick osei-kufuor', 'Shaibu Bukari']","Chieftaincy conflicts in Ghana are often presented as disputes involving rival groups over succession to traditional political power. However, chieftaincy conflicts are complex and often shaped by constellation of different actors, national and local level politics and elite maneuvering. This paper argues that chieftaincy conflicts go beyond the structural interpretations of competition and contestation for traditional power, but rather processual, encompassing constellations of diverse actors, elite politics and manipulation. In Northern Ghana, the combination of structural and processual factors drive chieftaincy conflicts. Party politics in chieftaincy conflicts have rendered chieftaincy institutions, that are supposed to be apolitical in nature, political.",Article,1.0, African Security,Jun 26,0,"

Starting with the archive: principles for prospective collaborative research,"['Rachel Thomson', 'Liam Berriman']","What are participants and researchers agreeing to when they consent to having data archived and what do they imagine the future life of their data to be? In this paper, we reflect on a project that deliberately started rather than ended with the archive. The Everyday Childhoods project invited children and their families to take part in the creation of an open access public archive documenting everyday childhoods using a range of multimedia data. Families and researchers were invited into the archive, encouraged to imagine different kinds of secondary use and to speak directly to future user of their data through short films and postcards. This paper raises questions concerning the place of the archive in different disciplinary traditions; the roles of researcher and archivist in safekeeping, gatekeeping and caring for data collections; and the place of qualitative longitudinal research as a site of innovation within a new data landscape.",Article,1.0, Qualitative Research,Jun 20,1,"

"Women’s self-help groups and asset accumulation in peri-urban Wa, Ghana","['Ibrahim Abdulai', 'Shaibu Bukari', 'Moses Naiim Fuseini']","Women’s self-help groups (SHGs) play an essential role in the fight against poverty. Despite this, studies on the impact of SHGs on women’s asset accumulation and incomes tend to focus on rural and urban areas, with peri-urban areas receiving little attention. Consequently, to help fill this gap, using the after-only study design, this study investigates the contribution of SHGs to asset accumulation in Wa’s peri-urban areas. A questionnaire and an observation guide were used to collect data from 199 SHG members. Thematic analysis was used to analyze qualitative data, while descriptive statistics, parametric and non-parametric methods were used to analyze quantitative data. Members were given loans, according to the study, but the repayment schedule was unfavourable. After joining SHGs, both productive and non-productive assets were acquired. Furthermore, those who took out loans and invested in income-generating ventures saw an increase in their earnings. In general, SHGs contributed to asset acquisition and income. SHG members should invest in productive assets to increase their incomes, according to the policy recommendation of this study. This study is unique because it focuses on SHGs in peri-urban areas, deviating from the norm by arguing that SHGs contribute to asset accumulation in those areas, thereby empowering members.",Article,1.0, African Journal of Science Technology Innovation and Development,May 22,0,"

Encounters with liminality: - transformative practices in the building of an adoptive family,['Louise Sims'],"In England the macro context of adoption practice is characterised by radical change across administrative, political and organisational systems. The adoption regionalisation programme is underpinned by a policy commitment to speed up ‘matching’ processes. The Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 states that adoptions should ‘proceed swiftly’ and some agencies are pioneering online and virtual introductions between children and prospective adopters. This paper offers a timely contribution to practice debates and scholarship in this area. Drawing on a collaborative doctoral study, ‘everyday’ practices are considered through an emergent theoretical framework, the ‘liminal hotspot’. The analysis hones in on the transformative practices generated in the early matching stages and the role of the social worker in their mediation and management. This paper supports findings from other studies that suggest that when matches are rushed necessary processing of complex dynamics is by-passed,creating unnecessary vulnerabilities in the fabric of new families.",Article,0.0, Journal of Social Work Practice,Mar 19,0,"

Surgical site infections: would stricter adherence to published clinical guidelines result in significant reduction in rates?,"['Sophie McDonald', 'Alasdair Bott']","Surgical site infections remain a prominent cause of hospital-acquired infection and are responsible for increased morbidity and mortality and considerable cost. Recommendations for strategies to reduce the rate of surgical site infections have been made by many over the years. In 2016, the World Health Organization published a robust set of guidelines with the same intention. Unfortunately, the rate of surgical site infection has not reduced as would be hoped with compilation of a large body of evidence. This article will examine those recommendations and consider if implementation of universal guidelines can successfully reduce rates of surgical site infection. Barriers to implementation of guidelines will also be contemplated, as if these factors are not addressed any future interventions will also likely by futile.",Article,0.0, Surgery (Oxford),Mar 2,0,"

We would like to begin by thanking the outgoing editorial team, comprising Janet Boddy, Sara Bragg, Wendy Sims-Schouten and Rachael Stryker, for their highly skilled leadership in growing and developing the journal and its audience over the last 4 years. We particularly note their willingness to push the boundaries of theoretical developments in Childhood Studies in their themed section on The Future of Childhood Studies and Children & Society (Stryker et al., 2019). They have left us with big boots to fill. Our arrival on the journal comes during highly challenging times globally, with the Covid-19 pandemic , the climate crisis and widening socioeconomic inequalities. A global reckoning with sexual misconduct and racial injustice as witnessed in the #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter movements has both challenged and inspired research and activism in raising awareness of the pernicious effects of inequalities. This raises important questions about the relationship between significant events in society and children's lives: what do these movements teach us about childhood and what does the study of childhood teach us about these movements? Now, more than ever, there is a pressing need to ensure that the voices and lives of children are well represented across research, policy and practice. During these times, we will endeavour to continue the mission of making Children & Society a key resource for practitioners, policy-makers and scholars seeking an understanding o

Unaccompanied Young Females and Social Workers: Meaning-Making in the Practice Space,"['Rachel Larkin', 'Michelle Lefevre']","This article considers the role and importance of the intersubjective practice space created between social workers and unaccompanied young females (UYFs)—girls and young women under eighteen years of age, who arrive in a country, not in the care of a parent or guardian, and claim asylum in their own right. The voices of UYFs are under-represented in the literature and there is very little research which considers social work with this marginalised group. Through a study of how UYFs and practitioners in England experienced and constructed each other during their everyday practice encounters, we discuss the potential of the practice space for creating mutual understandings and enabling positive changes. Analysis revealed that their subjective and affective experience of their encounters and of each other, both as individual humans and as representations of particular categories (asylum-seeker/looked-after child and professional helper/agent of the state), influenced how they engaged, communicated, co-constructed understandings of each other and viewed the process and outcomes of the social work contact. We argue for the importance of practice encounter spaces, their distinctiveness from what is written in policy and law and their potential as a site for creativity and change.",Article,0.0, British Journal of Social Work,Jan 13,0,"

COVID-19 and frontline health workers in West Africa: a scoping review,"['Kingsley Pereko', 'Edward Kwabena Ameyaw', 'Shaibu Bukari[...]', 'Alfred Dickson Dai-Kosi']","Introduction The novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has become a severe global health threat since its emergence. Overcoming the virus is partly dependent on the holistic wellbeing of frontline health workers. Implications of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa could be substantial given the limited resources and logistics. This scoping review maps available literature on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa. Materials and methods Literature on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa were searched in six databases namely Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Africa Journals Online (AJOL) and CINAHL. Further search was done across websites of the ministries of health of West African countries and notable organisations. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the findings taking cognisance of the overarching purpose of the study and the research question. Results Of the 67 studies identified, 19 were included in the final synthesis. Three main themes emerged and these are impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers, drivers of susceptibility to COVID-19 and government/donor support. A greater number of the studies originated from Nigeria. Each study reported at least one impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa. The impacts included death, fear, unwillingness to attend to COVID-19 patients and stigmatisation. Some health workers were not adhering to the safety protocols coupled with periodic shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and thereby had an increased susceptibility.

What matters to people with multiple long-term conditions and their carers?,"['Gemma Spiers', 'Elisabeth Boulton', 'Lynne Corner[...]', 'Barbara Hanratty']","Background The number of people living with multiple long-term conditions is increasing worldwide. This presents challenges for health and care systems, which must adapt to meet the needs of this population. This study drew on existing data to understand what matters to people living with multiple long-term conditions and identify priorities for future research. Methods Two studies were conducted. (1) A secondary thematic analysis of interview, survey and workshop data collected from the 2017 James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership for Older People with Multiple Conditions, and patient and public involvement workshops; (2) a review of ongoing research and published research priorities, relating to older people (80+) living with multiple long-term conditions. Findings Older people with multiple long-term conditions identified a number of key concerns: access to care, support for both the patient and their carer, physical and mental health and well-being and identifying opportunities for early prevention. The review identified no published research priorities or ongoing research focusing specifically on populations aged over 80 years with multiple long-term conditions. Conclusion Older people living with multiple long-term conditions experience care that is inadequate for their needs. A holistic approach to care that extends beyond treating single conditions will ensure wide-ranging needs are met. As multimorbidity rises worldwide, this is a critical message for practitioners across health and care settings. We also recommend key areas that should be given greater focus in future research and policy to inform effective and meaningful forms of support for people living with multiple long-term conditions.",Article,1.0, Postgraduate Medical Journal,3d ago,0,"

Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a structured social coaching intervention for people with psychosis (SCENE): protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"['Domenico Giacco', 'Agnes Chevalier', 'Megan Patterson[...]', 'Stefan Priebe']","Introduction People with psychosis tend to have smaller social networks than both people in the general population and other people with long-term health conditions. Small social networks are associated with poor quality of life. Preliminary evidence suggests that coaching patients to increase their social contacts may be effective. In this study, we assessed whether structured social coaching improves the quality of life of patients with psychosis (primary outcome) compared with an active control group, receiving information on local social activities. Methods and analysis A structured social coaching intervention was developed based on the literature and refined through stakeholder involvement. It draws on principles from motivational interviewing, solution focused therapy and structured information giving. It is provided over a 6-month period and can be delivered by a range of different mental health professionals. Its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness are assessed in a randomised controlled trial, compared with an active control group, in which participants are given an information booklet on local social activities. Participants are aged 18 or over, have a primary diagnosis of a psychotic disorder (International Classification of Disease: F20–29) and capacity to provide informed consent. Participants are assessed at baseline and at 6, 12 and 18 months after individual randomisation. The primary outcome is quality of life at 6 months (Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life). We hypothesise that the effects on quality of life are mediated by an increase in social contacts. Secondary outcomes are symptoms, social situation and time spent in social activities.

Neighbourhood characteristics and social isolation of people with psychosis: a multi-site cross-sectional study,"['Domenico Giacco', 'James B. Kirkbride', 'Anna Ermakova[...]', 'Stefan Priebe']","Purpose People with psychosis are vulnerable to social isolation, which is associated with worse clinical outcomes. In general populations, people living in areas with higher population density have more social contacts, while those living in more socially deprived and fragmented areas are less satisfied with their relationships. We assessed whether and how neighbourhood factors are associated with social contacts and satisfaction with friendships for people with psychosis. Methods We carried out a cross-sectional study including people with psychosis aged 18–65 years in urban and rural sites in England. Population density and social deprivation and fragmentation indexes were described within Lower Level Super Output Areas (LSOA). Their associations with participants’ social contacts and satisfaction with friendships were tested with negative binomial and ordinal regression models, respectively. Results We surveyed 511 participants with psychotic disorders. They had a median of two social contacts in the previous week (interquartile range [IQR] = 1–4), and rated satisfaction with friendships as 5 out of 7 (Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life; IQR = 4–6). Higher population density was associated with fewer social contacts (Z-standardised relative risk [RR] = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.79–0.99, p = 0.03), but not with satisfaction with friendships (RR = 1.08; 95% CI = 0.93–1.26, p = 0.31). No associations were found for social contacts or satisfaction with friendships with social deprivation or fragmentation indexes. Conclusions Clinicians in urban areas should be aware that their patients with psychosis are more socially isolated when more people live around them, and this could impact their clinical outcomes.

The mixed methods research finds that there is a relationship between not being able to heat the home and not being able to eat well. However, it appears that households struggle to do either, and there is considerable nuance in household decisions around energy use. Qualitative data analysis indicates the importance of energy billing periods, household composition and social and familial networks in terms of shaping household experiences and responses.

Energy poverty and social relations: A capabilities approach,"['Lucie Middlemiss', 'Pepa Ambrosio-Albalá', 'Nick Emmel[...]', 'Angela Tod']","Energy poverty is widely understood to be a complex and multi-faceted problem, with a range of drivers, and associated with household vulnerability. In this paper we draw on secondary qualitative data on energy poverty from the UK, as well as conceptual thinking informed by the capabilities approach, to explore a previously understudied facet of energy poverty: households’ social relations. We focus particularly on how relationships with family, friends, agencies and distant others impact on households’ ability to cope with energy poverty. We find that the connection between social relations and energy poverty is recursive: good social relations can both enable access to energy services, and be a product of such access. This connection is also mediated by more structural factors, such as access to resources, membership of particular collectivities, the need to perform particular social roles, and the common reasons attributed to poverty and energy use. Our work suggests that attempts to address vulnerability to energy poverty need to take into account the quality of households’ social relations, as well as the potential impact of policy and practice on social relations, given that people rely on their friends and families for information support and advice, on key agency workers for access to resources, and are also constrained by discourses of poverty.",Article,9.0, Energy Research & Social Science,,0,"

"Social Policies, Risks and Vulnerabilities: A Gender Perspective for Mauritius","['Zoë Irving', 'Verena Tandrayen-Ragoobur', 'Deepa Gokulsing']","This article investigates into how gender-neutral social policies affect gender dynamics of labour market participation, family life and livelihood. Taylor-Gooby’s [“New risks and social change”, pp. 1–28, 2004] new social risks concept and Holmes and Jones’ [Rethinking Social Protection from a Gender Lens. ODI Briefing Paper, 2010] framework are used to probe into the deepening of existing gender inequalities in the Mauritian multicultural society. The article argues that the prevailing social interventions in Mauritius overlook new social risks that have stemmed from the island’s economic transformation from a monocrop to an innovation based economy. This structural change has caused women, in particular, to face new risks and vulnerabilities. To advance the argument, the article examines gender norms, lack of appropriate gender-sensitive labour market policies and gender-neutral social protection measures. A mixed methodology is used with both secondary and primary data collected via interviews with key stakeholders from public and non-governmental organisations. The findings reveal the need to connect gender-sensitive welfare policies to risks and vulnerabilities to promote greater gender inclusiveness.",Article,1.0, Journal of International and Comparative Social Policy,Nov 12,0,"

WATER POVERTY IN ENGLAND AND WALES : EVIDENCE TO THE CONSUMER COUNCIL FOR WATER (CCW) REVIEW OF WATER POVERTY IN ENGLAND AND WALES,"['Jonathan Bradshaw', 'Antonia Keung']","Water poverty is conventionally defined as households spending more than 3% and 5% of their net income after housing costs on water. Water bills have risen faster than general prices and faster than earnings since privatisation. In 2018/19 21% of households paying for water in England and Wales were spending more than 3% of their income on water and sewerage and 10.0% were spending more than 5% of their income. If income is equivalised the water poverty rates remain the similar but the composition of water-poor households changes. The paper explores variation in water poverty and prospects for the future.

The Association Between the Material Well-Being and the Subjective Well-Being of Children in 35 Countries,"['Daphna Gross-Manos', 'Jonathan Bradshaw']","It is well established that child poverty has a profound, costly, and long-term impact on physical and mental health, educational attainment, and outcomes in adulthood. However, to date, while among adults a correlation between income and subjective well-being has been found, findings of such an association during childhood are mixed. This may be because the indicators available for both child poverty and subjective well-being have been limited – mainly to household incomes reported by adults and single measures of life satisfaction. This article explores the opportunities presented by the data collected in the third wave of Children’s Worlds, the school-based survey of children in 35 countries. The study employed a wider range of measures of material well-being, as well as subjective well-being, in terms of living standards in a larger range of countries. We have found that at both country comparative level, and within the country level, there is an association between material deprivation and some measures of subjective well-being, but the strength of the association varied between the country level and individual-level analyses, and across countries at the individual-level. At the macro-country level, the Family Affluence Scale was not significantly associated with most subjective well-being measures, while the deprivation scale, and a multi-dimensional measure that was developed in this paper, showed high correlations with overall life satisfaction and feelings of sadness. At the individual-level, the correlations were generally weak and varied between countries. We conclude with a discussion regarding possible explanations for these findings and their possible implications.",Article,1.0, Child Indicators Research,Oct 4,1,"

Transitions and non-transitions from neoliberalism in Latin America and Southern Europe,"['Juan Pablo Ferrero', 'Ramón I. Centeno', 'Antonios Roumpakis']","We seek to disentangle the process through which some democratic polities ‘escape’ from neoliberal rule while others do not. We understand neoliberalism as the resulting equilibrium provoked by the restoration of class power that undermined the pro-labour policies of the post-war period. Why do some democracies enter a route of political experimentation that challenges the status quo while others remain ‘trapped’ in an orthodox neoliberal settlement? Our argument is that for a democratic polity to initiate a transition from neoliberal rule, there needs to be a crisis of neoliberal rule, a compelling alternative willing to contend for state power in national elections, and a reliable democratic settlement that allows the victory of the challenger – that is, the alternative – over the neoliberal rulers. This model will be discussed by examining the following three cases: Argentina, Greece, and Mexico.",Article,1.0, Politics,Oct 3,1,"

Thomas']","BSTRACT Children ‘in care’ have, on average, lower educational attainment than their peers. This article tests the hypothesis that many of these children can ‘catch-up’, if in stable placements and secondary schools ‘apparently effective’ with other children with ‘similar’ difficulties. In a cohort of 542,998 16-year-old English children in mainstream schools, those in care for at least a year were on average 148,465 ranks behind their peers on measured attainment at age 7. At age 16, 21% of this group had ‘caught up’ improving their ranking by at least this amount. Allowing for covariates, we found that schools were differentially effective for disadvantaged pupil groups defined by eligibility for free school meals at age 7, in the bottom 3 deciles of attainment at entry to secondary school, or deemed ‘in need’ or as having behavioural, emotional or social difficulties. As predicted, the conditions for children in care catching up related to placement stability and measures of their school’s apparent impact on these disadvantaged groups. In the ‘worst’ conditions 4% caught up as against 52% in the ‘best’. The results support the hypotheses that best practice can reduce the educational gaps between children in care, other low attaining groups and their peers.",Article,1.0, Oxford Review of Education,Sep 30,1,"

Hearing dogs for people with severe and profound hearing loss: a wait-list design randomised controlled trial investigating their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness,"['Lucy Stuttard', 'Philip Boyle', 'Caroline Marie Fairhurst[...]', 'Bryony Anne Beresford']","Background Hearing loss increases the risk of poor outcomes across a range of life domains. Where hearing loss is severe or profound, audiological interventions and rehabilitation have limited impact. Hearing dogs offer an alternative, or additional, intervention. They live permanently with recipients, providing sound support and companionship. Methods A single-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the impacts of a hearing dog on mental well-being, anxiety, depression, problems associated with hearing loss (responding to sounds, fearfulness/social isolation), and perceived dependency on others. Participants were applicants to the UK charity ‘Hearing Dogs for Deaf People’. Eligibility criteria were as follows: first-time applicant; applying for a hearing dog (as opposed to other support provided by the charity). Participants were randomised 1:1 to the following: receive a hearing dog sooner than usual [HD], or within the usual application timeframe (wait-list [WL] comparator). The primary outcome was mental well-being (Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale) 6 months (T1) after HD received a hearing dog. The cost-effectiveness analysis took a health and social care perspective. Results In total, 165 participants were randomised (HD n = 83, WL n = 82). A total of 112 (67.9%) were included in the primary analysis (HD n = 55, WL n = 57). At T1, mental well-being was significantly higher in the HD arm (adjusted mean difference 2.53, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.79, p < 0.001).

"Scoping the literature on Patient travel abroad for cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment","['Neil Lunt', 'Ka‐wo Fung']","The incidence of cancer is on the rise globally. Under particular circumstances, patients are willing to travel abroad for healthcare treatments. We know relatively little however about patients travelling overseas for cancer‐related screening, diagnosis and treatment. Where do patients go, for what treatments, what are their motivations, decision‐making processes and treatment experiences? What do we know about patient safety and risk, and outcomes? More broadly, what are the ethical and legal implications? This review presents the first published assessment of what we term ‘transnational oncology treatment’, defined as patients travelling overseas or across borders for cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment. The review undertakes detailed search and retrieval of the literature, using an accepted scoping review method. We present a narrative review of existing knowledge and themes, identifying coverage and gaps. There is a five‐fold agenda for future investigation: trajectories and itineraries; in depth focus on treatment decisions, experiences and outcomes; locating patient travel within wider health system analysis; exploration of professional perspectives and coordination; and situating travel within the context of health trade. Such an agenda is multidisciplinary and wide‐ranging, encompassing epidemiology, health economics, health policy ethics, health politics, health management, and health policy.",Literature Review,1.0, International Journal of Health Planning and Management,Sep 17,0,"

Identifying older adults with frailty approaching end-of-life: A systematic review,"['Alex Hall', 'Elisabeth Boulton', 'Patience Kunonga[...]', 'Barbara Hanratty']","Background People with frailty may have specific needs for end-of-life care, but there is no consensus on how to identify these people in a timely way, or whether they will benefit from intervention. Aim To synthesise evidence on identification of older people with frailty approaching end-of-life, and whether associated intervention improves outcomes. Design Systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42020462624). Data sources Six databases were searched, with no date restrictions, for articles reporting prognostic or intervention studies. Key inclusion criteria were adults aged 65 and over, identified as frail via an established measure. End-of-life was defined as the final 12 months. Key exclusion criteria were proxy definitions of frailty, or studies involving people with cancer, even if also frail. Results Three articles met the inclusion criteria. Strongest evidence came from one study in English primary care, which showed distinct trajectories in electronic Frailty Index scores in the last 12 months of life, associated with increased risk of death. We found no studies evaluating established clinical tools (e.g. Gold Standards Framework) with existing frail populations. We found no intervention studies; the literature on advance care planning with people with frailty has relied on proxy definitions of frailty. Conclusion Clear implications for policy and practice are hindered by the lack of studies using an established approach to assessing frailty. Future end-of-life research needs to use explicit approaches to the measurement and reporting of frailty, and address the evidence gap on interventions. A focus on models of care that incorporate a palliative approach is essential.",Article,1.0, Palliative Medicine,Sep 16,1,"

Asset-based and strengths-based community initiatives in the UK,['Neil Lunt'],"There is growing interest in the contribution of asset- and strengths-based activities within social and community development. Asset-based approaches focus on people’s and communities’ assets (their capacities, resources and networks) as well as their needs. At an individual level, it entails assessments and conversations emphasising personal and community strengths rather than deficits.1 The aim of this brief article is to overview a number of initiatives across the UK and discuss the challenges in embedding them within local settings. The discussion proceeds as follows. First, an overview of the prevailing policy context within which community development and associated initiatives have emerged. Second, a discussion of the values and aspirations framing such initiatives. Third, the paper review a range of initiatives.

"Feasibility, acceptability and sustainability of postpartum contraceptive implant provision by midwives in NSW public hospitals","['Jessica R Botfield', 'Melanie Tulloch', 'Hannah Contziu[...]', 'Kirsten Black']","Background Repeat pregnancy in the first year after a birth is common. Many of these conceptions are unintended and may be prevented by providing access to contraception in the immediate postpartum period. Midwives in the hospital setting could potentially play a greater role in improving postnatal contraception information and provision. Aim We sought to implement and examine the success of a program training hospital-based midwives in immediate postpartum implant insertion. Methods This mixed methods study in two hospitals in New South Wales sought to explore the feasibility, acceptability and sustainability of a program that provided competency-based implant insertion training for midwives. The study documented training completion, implant insertion numbers and experience, and conducted end of study interviews with midwives and stakeholders. Findings Twenty-seven midwives undertook training and inserted 265 implants during the study period. Interviews with 13 midwives and 11 stakeholders concluded the program to be feasible and acceptable with midwives reporting high satisfaction from their involvement. All interviewees felt that midwives were well placed to insert implants, and reported that challenges around workload and opportunities for practice were generally manageable. It was recognised that sustainability of the program would require supportive policy and regular insertion opportunities. Conclusions Midwives successfully upskilled in implant insertions and there was widespread support for the program with expectations it would be sustained. Provision of contraceptive information and implant insertion by midwives in the immediate postpartum period is likely to incr

Philanthropy and the Feminist Ethics of Care: Prospects and Problems,"['Annie Herro', 'Franklin Obeng-Odoom']","Surging philanthropic enterprises across the globe have raised questions about different approaches to giving and their associated moral theories. Much attention has been devoted to 'effective altruism', an outgrowth of the broader paradigm of 'effective' philanthropy which is aimed at addressing social problems using a businesslike , data-driven, outcome-oriented approach. Hierarchical in its decision-making structures and patterned after patriarchal social relations, effective altruism marginalises the weaker parties in the deliberations surrounding funding. The feminist ethics of care constitutes a formidable alternative because it emphasises contextuality, relationality and gender-equitable structures of care in philanthropy. Yet, apart from taking insufficient account of multiple identities, such as sexualities and race, class and caste, this paradigm overlooks hierarchical geographical and socio-spatial relations across the world and elevates household relations over community relations. More fundamentally, as a paradigm, care ethics portrays the existence and persistence of global inequalities and stratification as fortuitous, amenable to the care of the privileged. We highlight the importance of evolving care-based philanthropy to strengthen alternatives to effective altruism.",Preprint,,,,0,"

Taking the Research Journey Together: The Insider and Outsider Experiences of Aboriginal and Non-Aboriginal Researchers.,"['Angela Dew', 'Elizabeth Mcentyre', 'Priya Vaughan']","Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of Australia are among the most researched in the world. Indigenous research methodologies reframe a historical colonial-centric and often exploitative research paradigm, to instead privilege the voices and perspectives of Indigenous peoples within a social justice framework. In this article, we describe the lessons learnt in a research partnership between an Aboriginal and two Anglo-Australian researchers conducting an arts-based action research project in collaboration with five Aboriginal communities in New South Wales, Australia. We identify the importance of reflexivity to shed light on the impact of insider and outsider status in order to design and conduct culturally and ethically informed research with Aboriginal communities. Reflexivity, and a collaborative, adaptive approach to research processes also operates to ensure cultural and professional integrity are embedded into such research projects.",Article,9.0, Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung,,0,"

A Novel Approach to First-Rib Resection in Neurogenic Thoracic Outlet Syndrome,"['Yueying Li', 'Yanxi Liu', 'Zhan Zhang[...]', 'Shusen Cui']","Objectives: The treatment for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (NTOS) conventionally involves first-rib resection (FRR) surgery, which is quite challenging to perform, especially for novices, and is often associated with postoperative complications. Herein, we report a new segmental resection approach through piezo surgery that involves using a bone cutter, which can uniquely provide a soft tissue protective effect. Methods: This retrospective study involved the examination of 26 NTOS patients who underwent piezo surgery and another group of 30 patients who underwent FRR using the conventional technique. In the patient group that underwent piezo surgery, the rib was first resected into two pieces using a piezoelectric device and subsequently removed. In the patient group that underwent conventional surgery, the first rib was removed as one piece using a rib cutter and rongeurs. Results: The piezo surgery group had significantly shorter operative time (96.85 ± 14.66 vs. 143.33 ± 25.64 min, P < 0.001) and FRR duration (8.73 ± 2.11 vs. 22.23 ± 6.27 min, P < 0.001) than the conventional group. The posterior stump length of the residual rib was shorter in the piezo surgery group than in the conventional group (0.54 ± 0.19 vs. 0.65 ± 0.15 cm, P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in postoperative complications and scores of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, the Cervical Brachial Symptom Questionnaire (CBSQ), and the visual analog scale (VAS). Even the TOS index (NTOS Index = [DASH + (0.83 × CBSQ) + (10 × VAS)]/3) and patient self-assessments of both the groups showed no significant differences.

Explaining divergent National Responses to Covid-19: An Enhanced State Capacity Framework,"['Linda Weiss', 'Elizabeth Thurbon']","We develop a state capacity framework to account for different national responses to Covid-19. Our starting point is the influential idea that neoliberalism has a major role to play in state failure to control the pandemic. By implementing neoliberal reforms, states have ostensibly rendered themselves incapable of preventing or mitigating the viral outbreak. A focus on the British experience lends weight to this perspective. But when viewed in a comparative light, the picture is less straightforward. By comparing the British and Australian cases, we see a similar embrace of neoliberal reforms across the whole of government, yet with strikingly divergent outcomes. How can we account for this dramatic difference? To answer this question, we offer an enhanced state capacity framework to improve our understanding of diverse national responses to Covid-19. Our larger objective is to enrich the existing state capacity literature in two ways. First, we extend the existing state capacity framework by introducing a new category – salutary capacity – to encapsulate a state's ability to correct and counteract the course of a national health emergency. Second, we introduce the idea of political choice to emphasise the importance of agency in offsetting the institutional weaknesses associated with neoliberal reform.",Article,1.0, New Political Economy,,1,"

Relationship-Based Practice in Therapeutic Residential Care: A Double-Edged Sword,"['Kenny Kor', 'Elizabeth Fernandez', 'Jo Spangaro']","This article draws on the lived experiences and perspectives of young people and practitioners in therapeutic residential care to examine what constitutes relationship-based practice. Eight young people and twenty-six practitioners across three residential care services in Australia participated in this qualitative study. Framework analysis identifies that personalised engagement, a delicate balance between care and control, and perseverance through turbulent times are conducive to relationship-based practice in therapeutic residential care. Relationship-based practice is also found to be employed in a unique historical and relational context that demands mindful navigation through three specific professional boundary issues including self-disclosure, over-identification and physical contact. Against this context, relationship-based practice in therapeutic residential care is considered a ‘double-edged sword’, offering practitioners copious opportunities to build connections with young people in informal environments whilst needing to mitigate multiple ethical ambiguities. Implications for practice include the need to safeguard the ‘do no harm’ priority whilst resisting defensive or detached practice. Contextualising relationship-based practice within an ethical practice framework to embed ethics work in day-to-day practice becomes paramount.",Article,1.0, British Journal of Social Work,,0,"

Male dominated workplaces and the power of masculine privilege: a comparison of the Australian Political and Construction sectors,"['Natalie Galea', 'Louise Chappell']","Increasing women's representation in male dominated work sectors remains a persistent problem. This paper reorientates the focus from women's underrepresentation to male overrepresentation and privilege, to identify and compare the causal mechanisms between the overrepresentation of men in two traditionally male dominated work places in Australia: politics and construction. By applying feminist institutionalism, masculinities and privilege, it argues the overrepresentation of men is linked to gendered rules that uphold hegemonic masculinities which produce masculine privilege and supports a gender hierarchy. Masculine privilege occurs via three mechanisms: 1. a culture of denial; 2. perceptions that rules are neutral, legitimate and applied objectively; 3. through backlash and resistance to keep the gender status quo in place. We argue the effects of privilege combine to act as a barrier to the attraction, retention and progression of women to both sectors and conclude that the masculine privilege provides a valuable lens to explore how male dominance operates within work sectors.

Corrigendum to: Cost–benefit analysis of enhancing the uptake of long-acting reversible contraception in Australia,"['Kristine Concepcion', 'Sarina Lacey', 'Kevin McGeechan[...]', 'Jessica R Botfield']","Objective Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) is the most effective form of reversible contraception, but its use in Australia is low compared with other countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the economic effect of an increase in LARC uptake to international rates.Methods An economic model was designed to assess two scenarios, namely increasing the current rate of LARC uptake of 12.5% to the international benchmark of 14.8% among: (1) women currently using the oral contraceptive pill (OCP); and (2) women at risk of pregnancy and not using contraception. Model inputs included cost of contraceptive methods, discontinuation rates and abortion and miscarriage costs associated with unintended pregnancies.ResultsWomen who switch from an OCP to LARC would save A$114–157 per year. Those not currently using any contraception who adopt LARC would incur costs of A$36–194 per year, but would reap savings from the reduction in unintended pregnancies. Over 5 years there would be a net saving of A$74.4 million for Scenario 1 and A$2.4 million for Scenario 2.Conclusion Greater use of LARC would result in a net gain in economic benefits to Australia. These benefits are largely driven by women switching from an OCP to LARC who have reduced costs, as well as women wishing to avoid pregnancy who choose to use LARC rather than no method. This evidence will support women making an informed contraceptive choice and policy makers in increasing the accessibility of LARC.What is known about the topic?LARC is the most effective form of reversible contraception, but uptake in Australia is relatively low.What does this paper add?There are economic benefits to society for women w

Overcoming incumbent resistance to the clean energy shift: How local governments act as change agents in coal power station closures in China,"['Hao Tan', 'Elizabeth Thurbon', 'Sung-Young Kim', 'John A. Mathews']","Phasing out the use of coal for power generation is an important concern for energy policy in the context of green transition. Despite the efforts of other nations, the role of China in the global phase-out of coal power remains crucial. Our study with a sub-national focus sheds important new light on the drivers and decision-making dynamics of exiting of coal power use in China. Based on a case study of closures of coal power plants in China's Guangdong province, we find that under certain circumstances, governments - especially those in the provincial and city levels - can and do act as change agents when it comes to retirement of coal fired power stations. Our study reveals a number of push and pull mechanisms that governments have utilized to overcome the resistance of incumbent power generation companies, primarily based on developmental considerations. By identifying the drivers and enabling mechanisms of phasing out the use of coal power in a significant sub-national region in China, our study contributes to both of the sustainability transition literature and the energy policy literature.",Article,1.0, Energy Policy,Jan 14,0,"

Urban water security under a changing climate: Is Nepal's water policy on the right track?,"['Hemant Raj Ojha', 'Kamal Devkota', 'Chandra Pandey[...]', 'Anthony Zwi']","en Nepal's urban regions are facing increasing levels of water insecurity under a changing climate. The country has a long history of water policy development while climate-related policies are also emerging at different levels of the new federal republic. It is unclear whether public policy is on the right track to ensure urban water security in the face of growing demand and increasingly variable supply. In this paper, we assess how Nepal's water policy is shaping urban adaptation. We focus on how policies have defined institutional arrangements for water supply and management, allocation of water rights, and the conservation of water source catchments. Policy attention to these issues is crucial for the adaptation of water systems to climate change. Drawing on the review of policy texts and the status of policy implementation in two towns (Dharan and Dhulikhel), we conclude that current policy frameworks and strategies neglect opportunities to facilitate urban water adaptation to climate change. The neglect is seen in escalating conflicts among institutions, an unclear framework for water rights, and inadequate incentives for catchment conservation. We highlight the need for a more coherent and risk sensitive approach to water policy, underpinned by deliberative, research-informed, and learning-based strategies. 摘要 zh 气候变化背景下, 尼泊尔的城市地区正面临越来越严重的水不安全。该国拥有悠久的水政策发展史, 同时, 与气候相关的政策也正出现于该国的不同层面。尚不清晰的是, 面临水需求上涨和日益变化的水供给时, 公共政策是否在确保城市水安全的正轨上。本文中, 我们评估了尼泊尔水政策如何影响城市适应(urban adaptation)。我们聚焦于政府如何定义水供应和管理方面的制度安排、水权分配以及水源流域的保护。对这些问题给予政策关注, 对气候变化下的水系统适应而言是关键的。基于对政策文本的分析和两城市(Dharan 和Dhulikhel)的政策落实状态, 我们的结论认为, 现有政策框架和策略忽视了一系列能促进气候变化下城市水适应的机遇。这种忽视体现在机构间冲突的加剧、水权框架的不清晰、以及用于流域保护的激励措施不足。我们强调需要一个更一致的、对风险保持敏感的水政策措施, 辅以商议性的、基于研究和学习的策略。 Resumen es Las regiones urbanas de Nepal se enfrentan a niveles crecientes de inseguridad hídrica en un clima cambiante. El país tiene una larga historia de desarrollo de políticas de agua, mientras que las políticas relacionadas con el clima también están surgiendo en diferentes niveles de la nueva república federal. No está claro si las políticas públicas están en el camino correcto para garantizar la seguridad hídrica urbana frente a la creciente demanda y la oferta cada vez más variable. En este documento, evaluamos cómo la política hídrica de Nepal está dando forma a la adaptación urbana. Nos enfocamos en cómo las políticas han definido los arreglos institucionales para el suministro y la gestión del agua, la asignación de derechos de agua y la conservación de las cuencas de captación de fuentes de agua. La atención política a estos temas es crucial para la adaptación de los sistemas de agua al cambio climático. Basándonos en la revisión de los textos de políticas y el estado de implementación de políticas en dos ciudades (Dharan y Dhulikhel), llegamos a la conclusión de que los marcos de políticas y las estrategias actuales ignoran las oportunidades para facilitar la adaptación del agua urbana al cambio climático. La negligencia se ve en la escalada de conflictos entre instituciones, un marco poco claro para los derechos de agua e incentivos inadecuados para la conservación de las cuencas hidrográficas. Destacamos la necesidad de un enfoque de la política del agua más coherente y sensible al riesgo, respaldado por estrategias deliberativas, informadas por la investigación y basadas en el aprendizaje.",Article,1.0, World Water Policy,Nov 18,0,"

“Our ways to planning”: Preparing to plan with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with disability,"['Angela Dew', 'Elizabeth Mcentyre', 'Leanne Dowse', 'Priya Vaughan']","This paper reports on the development of the Our Ways to Planning framework. The framework is intended as a guide for Australian organisations to work in safe and culturally appropriate ways to assist and enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with disability to make plans about their physical and mental health, wellbeing and future. The Our Ways to Planning framework is based on data collected via community-led research undertaken with Aboriginal people with disability and their family members and workers from five communities in New South Wales. Community mapping, an arts-based research method, was used to learn about the experiences of Aboriginal people with disability and their families regarding planning and access to services. Using iterative, thematic analysis, the research team identified core themes and concepts around which to structure the framework. The framework identifies three 'bridges' to organisational readiness for planning: knowledge, understanding and choice. It focuses on the importance of non-Aboriginal-led organisations learning from, and collaborating with, community-based Aboriginal-led organisations in order to build capacity in both types of organisations. The framework advocates for open and respectful organisational engagement with the needs of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people with disability. It also acknowledges the importance of developing an awareness of Aboriginal cultures, histories and points of view, given their influence on planning processes. The Our Ways to Planning framework provides a model for organisational capacity-building for effective planning that responds directly to the experiences and needs of Aboriginal people with disability, family membe

Practitioners’ experience of implementing therapeutic residential care: A multi-perspective study,"['Kenny Kor', 'Elizabeth Fernandez', 'Jo Spangaro']","Repeated inquiries into residential care for children and young people in out-of-home care have documented persistent service inadequacies. Calls for reforming residential care into therapeutic care have received growing attention in recent years. However, limited research data exists to inform how therapeutic care can be optimally implemented in residential care settings. This research draws on the first-hand experience of residential care practitioners to examine the barriers they experienced when implementing therapeutic care. Twenty-six practitioners across five different service strata (senior managers, therapeutic specialists, caseworkers, team leaders and direct care workers) from three Australian residential care organizations participated in semi-structured interviews. Framework analysis of the interview data indicated, whilst there was a strong consensus that therapeutic residential care should be underpinned by trauma-informed knowledge, its implementation is constrained by six barriers: (1) inconsistent understandings of how therapeutic care should be operationalized; (2) crisis-driven referrals and assessments; (3) problematic placement configuration and client mix; (4) inadequate workforce development; (5) the emotional cost of care; and (6) atrophied clinical support. These barriers call into question the extent to which therapeutic residential care is implemented as intended. Findings indicate that, to actualize the full potential of therapeutic residential care, substantial work is needed to provide a more translatable practice framework, strengthen referral and assessment processes, revitalize the workforce and elevate implementation efforts to a systemic level, bringing closer alignment between different se

"Exploring the relationship between functional limitations of the older adults and the health-related quality of life of their spouse in Shaanxi Province, China","['Wanyue Dong', 'Anthony Zwi', 'Chi Shen[...]', 'Jianmin Gao']","Background With trends towards longer life expectancy, lifetime with disability has also been prolonged. It is increasingly recognized that not only the person with disability but also those around them are affected. The relationship between functional limitation (FL) of the older adults and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of their spouse is of interest. So too is the determination of the factors aside from FL that influence HRQoL. Methods The sample was derived from the 2013 National Health Service Survey conducted in Shaanxi Province in China. Married couples aged ≥ 60 years were selected (n = 3463). The European quality of life five dimensions (EQ-5D) and visual analogue scale were used to measure HRQoL. Results Both wife and husband reported lower HRQoL if either the male or female partner had some or serious FLs ( P < 0.001). Other factors associated with lower HRQoL of the spouse included age, lower educational level, presence of chronic disease, and lower household economic status. Family size was associated with wife's HRQoL only when the male had no FL and lived with another 1–2 persons, or when the male had some FLs and lived in a larger family (n ≥ 5). Residential status did not relate to the HRQoL of spouses regardless of FL status. Conclusions Older adults in Shaanxi province who have partners with FLs tend to report poorer EQ-5D, suggesting that couples amongst whom one has FL may be particularly vulnerable to lower HRQoL.",Article,1.0, Health and Quality of Life Outcomes,Sep 1,1,"

Implementing a crèche-based community drowning programme in rural Bangladesh: A process evaluation,"['Medhavi Gupta', 'Aminur Rahman', 'Notan C Dutta[...]', 'Jagnoor Jagnoor']","Background Living and environmental conditions in rural Bangladesh expose children to drowning. The Anchal programme protects children through crèche-based supervision in an enclosed space run by locally recruited carers. It is unclear under what conditions the programme best operates to maximise protection. We conducted a process evaluation of Anchal to determine enabling factors and challenges to implementation. Methods Quantitative programme data were analysed to calculate metrics including child participation and fidelity of implementation to defined processes. Qualitative data collection with programme participants and implementers provided insights into barriers and enablers of implementation. Analysis was guided by the UK Medical Research Council’s process evaluation framework. Results Anchal operated 400 centres with an average of 22.2 children enrolled, as per target. However, daily attendance averaged lower than the 80% target. Children aged 1–2 years old, who are most at risk of drowning, were least likely to enrol and attend regularly due to low engagement with activities and parental concerns for safety. Greater distances and lower educational attainment in some regions reduced attendance and increased carer attrition. Conclusions The Anchal programme met most programme delivery targets. However, programme success could be improved through increasing supervision, providing communication training for implementing staff, designing programmes for children aged 1–2 years old, encouraging community ownership and providing child pick-up services. These contextual solutions can be adapted to similar programmes operating through grassroots-level engagement and recruitment of com

"‘They Are Here Without Chains, but With Invisible Chains’: Understandings of Modern Slavery Within the New South Wales Settlement Sector","['Keren David', 'Michael Salter']","Modern slavery is a complex and clandestine social phenomenon that is poorly understood in the Australian context. The settlement sector is integral to Australia’s counter-slavery efforts, and yet, no Australian study has explicitly sought to explore how this group identifies and navigates modern slavery. This paper draws on surveys and interviews with workers in the New South Wales settlement sector, and offers new insights into how certain forms of modern slavery are understood and addressed by professionals working with newly arrived migrants. The findings of the study uncover some of the profound challenges staff encounter in detecting and responding to different exploitative practices. Furthermore, they underscore the significant disjunctions between existing legislative provisions that aim to address modern slavery, and the experiences and understandings of workers at the frontline of the issue. The study demonstrates the need for education and greater investment into modern slavery responses within the settlement sector, and multi-sectoral collaboration to proactively address the systemic issues engendering exploitation at a community level.",Article,1.0, Social & Legal Studies,Feb 15,1,"

Digital media and domestic violence in Australia: essential contexts,"['Molly Dragiewicz', 'Bridget Harris', 'Delanie Woodlock', 'Michael Salter']","Domestic violence is a pervasive social problem in Australia. Digital media are increasingly integral to its dynamics. Technology-facilitated coercive control (TFCC) is a form of gender-based violence. This article examines domestic violence survivors’ experiences with TFCC, drawing on interviews with 20 Australian women. Study results enhance understanding of how abusers use digital media. We highlight four key contexts for understanding the role of technology in domestic violence: the coercive and controlling relationship, separation abuse, co-parenting and survivors’ safety work. These contexts provide insight into the dynamics of TFCC and illuminate key differences between this and other forms of online abuse. Key messages Technology is integral to coercive control. Separation and co-parenting are key sites of technology-facilitated coercive control. Survivors manage technology-facilitated abuse in the absence of adequate responses and support. </ul",Article,1.0, Journal of Gender-Based Violence,Jan 1,0,"

"Gender, health and ageing in Fiji: a mixed methods analysis","['Rebecca Dodd', 'Janani Shanthosh', 'Thomas Lung[...]', 'Anna Palagyi']","Background Women are disadvantaged by ageing: older women are more likely than older men to suffer from ill-health, have less access to health care and suffer discrimination within the health care system. Globally, there is a dearth of health research on gender and ageing with substantial knowledge gaps in low and middle-income country contexts. Part of a wider investigation on health and ageing in Fiji, our objective was to identify and describe gendered differences in healthy ageing in this Pacific Island context which we believe to be the first such study in the Pacific region. Methods Applying a health systems lens, we used a mixed-methods approach, encompassing analysis of cause of death data; focus group discussion to gather community and family attitudes to health services; and policy analysis, and then used data triangulation techniques to draw out key themes and insights. Results We found that gender affects health outcomes among older persons, attitudes towards and experience of healthy ageing, and an older person’s access to and use of health services. We also found that while Fiji’s policy response to ageing has recognised the importance of gender, to-date there has been limited action to address gender differences. Gender (as oppose to sex differences) has direct and indirect implications for the health of older Fijians, while gendered inequalities and patriarchal norms appear to affect both men and women’s experience of ageing and the health system response. Further, gender and age discrimination may be intersecting, intensifying their separate effects. Conclusion This study demonstrates the feasibility and importance of applying a gender lens to the study of healthy ageing. Our findings from Fiji are like

Production and distribution of child sexual abuse material by parental figures,"['Michael Salter', 'Tim Wong']","Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is widely available online. Existing research indicates that the parents and parental figures of victims are notably represented in offender populations. However, there is limited research in this area. Drawing on Australian media and legal databases, this study created a database of 82 cases of CSAM production and distribution perpetrated by parents and/or parental figures from 2009 to 2019. The study found that perpetrators are most often the male parental figures of the victims, and victims are predominately girls under nine years of age. The findings reveal distinct patterns and scenarios of parental CSAM offending that may inform prevention, early intervention and improved responses to victims. The study documented the significant impact of parental CSAM offending on victims and the need for specialist victim support.",Book,,,Nov 4,1,"

Relevance in a state of flux: Civil society and environmental protection in Kazakhstan,['Fengshi Wu'],"This chapter explores the key mechanisms at work that have enabled the civil society actors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to not only sustain themselves but also continue to be relevant in environmental protection and social justice building in the unsettling political environment of Kazakhstan. Focusing on nature conservation, this research has found that NGOs have been able to retain their organizational autonomy and policy impact by both working with the existing institutional opportunities and mobilizing resistance outside the state system. Moreover, a decent level of autonomy and self-capacity of local NGOs and civil society group is the prerequisite, not the outcome, of having effective support from international organizations, particularly United Nations agencies and well-established global environmental NGOs, in the authoritarian context.",Preprint,,,,0,"

Facilitating access to scene photographs and CCTV footage for relatives bereaved after violent death,"['Jane Mowll', 'Gillian Adams', 'Juliet Darling']","Family members bereaved after a violent death may be prevented from seeing visual images such as photographs of the body or closed circuit television footage of the person at the scene of death taken as part of the investigation. However, there is little information on the helpfulness or otherwise of supported exposure to such, often graphic, visual evidentiary material contained in police reports. We draw on a case study approach to explore the lived experience of two bereaved family members and the practice experience of the social work authors to understand the meanings of seeing these visual images. These lived-practice experiences suggest that seeing such visual images, in the context of support, may provide a deeper understanding of the death event and facilitate a sense of peace for bereaved relatives. This paper contributes an insight into the meanings and benefits as well as the practice challenges of viewing such material which, it is argued, are differently experienced from seeing the body itself. Recommendations for practice are discussed, alongside suggestions for future research in representative samples.",Article,7.0, Bereavement Care,Sep 14,0,"

Sexuality education for primary school students with disability in Fiji,"['Jessica R Botfield', 'Sera Ratu', 'Esiteri Turagabeci[...]', 'Yan Cheng']","Background People with disability have the same sexual and reproductive health needs and rights as people without disability, yet experience considerable barriers in accessing information and services. The Reproductive and Family Health Association of Fiji, Family Planning Australia, and disability stakeholders implemented a comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) disability inclusion project to increase access for students with disability to age-appropriate sexuality education. Method A train the trainer model was utilised, whereby staff and disability stakeholders undertook competency-based training on delivering sexuality education to teachers and people with disability, then trained and supported teachers working in special disability schools to provide sexuality education to students. An evaluation explored the acceptability and effectiveness of the project, utilising baseline and endline surveys and interviews. Findings From 2016 to 2018, the CSE disability project reached teachers and students in nine special disability schools in Fiji. At project completion, teachers reported increased confidence overall in teaching about sexuality and relationships, and students demonstrated increased knowledge regarding puberty and body changes. Interview findings suggested the project contributed to overcoming silence and stigma for people with disability and promoting safety for young people. Conclusion Age- and developmentally appropriate sexuality education for people with disability is essential for equipping them with necessary knowledge and skills.

"The significance of technology as both a resource in enhancing safety, and a means of perpetrating violence: the implications for policy and practice","['Sandra Gendera', 'kylie valentine', 'Jan Breckenridge']","There is evidence that technological devices such as personal safety alarms and security cameras can be effective in contributing to an increased sense of safety for victims of domestic and family violence, when they are provided as part of a broader programme of support. This article reports on findings from a mixed methods evaluation of a programme trialled in Queensland, Australia. The programme was funded by the Commonwealth Department of Social Services as part of the Keeping Women Safe in Their Home initiative. The trial was comprised of two components: the provision of personal safety alarms and security cameras to victims, and the resourcing of service providers to identify and respond to technology-facilitated abuse experienced by their clients. The findings from the evaluation of the trial contribute to an emerging evidence base on technology as a means to support and increase the safety of victims of violence. The findings also contribute to evidence on the capacity of the sector to respond to the use of technology to harass, monitor and stalk victims.There are benefits to clients and service providers from the innovative use of technology as part of a holistic and flexible domestic and family violence service response to meet the needs of victims, including those who wish to remain in their home. However, service providers in the trial felt less confident in supporting victims of technology-facilitated abuse. The limited uptake of strategies provided to assess and monitor technology-facilitated abuse indicates that support workers in the domestic violence sector would benefit from capacity building in this area.

'For my safety' Experiences of technology-facilitated abuse among women with intellectual disability or cognitive disability,"['Bridget Harris', 'Delanie Woodlock']","This research explores experiences of technology-facilitated abuse among women living with intellectual or cognitive disability. The findings are based on interviews with women with intellectual or cognitive disability and frontline workers who provide support services. This research was commissioned to address major gaps in the evidence about technology-facilitated abuse against women with intellectual or cognitive disability. The report reveals that the tactics used for technology-facilitated abuse of women with intellectual or cognitive disability are like those faced by all women, but there are some unique differences. Summary of key findings: Women's experiences Technology featured in the women’s lives in important ways. They used a variety of digital devices and platforms to connect with friends, family and partners as well as access information and services. In some instances, perpetrators could remove technology from these women, which could impact their autonomy, wellbeing and safety. The women had experienced a range of abuses, from general harassment to misuse of their online accounts, being monitored using spyware and tracking devices, and having their intimate images or videos shared without their consent. While most commonly the perpetrator was a partner or ex-partner, they included family members, carers and strangers. Barriers to support: Fear was a primary barrier for the women in seeking help for technology-facilitated abuse, including fear of having digital devices, apps and internet access removed, or of not being believed. In some instances, a woman’s situation was further complicated because her partner was also her carer. Women could feel trapped by needing to maintain access to their children

"Балансы сил, угроз и интересов: логика стратегического сближения Китая и России в постбиполярный период [Balances of Power, Threat, and Interests: The Logic behind China-Russia Strategic Alignment in the Post-Cold War Period]",['Alexander Korolev'],"Со времени распада СССР отношения между Китаем и Россией демонстрируют устойчивую позитивную динамику, по многим параметрам приближаясь к стратегическому союзу. При этом большинство попыток выявления причин этого сближения, как правило, ограничиваются указанием на продолжающееся ухудшение отношений этих стран с Западом, прежде всего США. Однако такой подход представляется недостаточным, поскольку не позволяет в полной мере выявить детерминанты российско-китайского сближения и оценить устойчивость данной тенденции. В представленной статье на основе современных наработок в теории формирования стратегических межгосударственных союзов предпринята попытка дать комплексную оценку причин формирования и эволюции отношений Российской Федерации и КНР, связав их с общей логикой развития системы международных отношений в постбиполярный период. Для этого автор предлагает опереться на эпистемологический потенциал трех основных подходов к объяснению причин формирования стратегических союзов, представленных концепциями «баланса сил», «баланса угроз» и «баланса интересов». При этом предлагается проанализировать российско-китайское взаимодействие не только с точки зрения изменений внутри каждого из этих балансов по отдельности, но и с позиции их взаимного переплетения и взаимного влияния.

What’s on offer: how do parties appeal to women voters in election manifestos?,"['Anna Sanders', 'Francesca Gains', 'Claire Annesley']","Existing research has tended to examine party manifesto appeals to women voters as a homogenous group however we know relatively little about how parties appeal to different groups of women voters. Yet there are strong incentives for parties to respond to and reflect diversity in women’s voting behaviour. Through a gendered analysis of party manifestos at the 2015, 2017 and 2019 British general elections, we investigate the spread and reach of parties’ policy appeals to women voters. We find that, while the principal state-wide parties are increasingly recognizing women’s diversity in their policy pledges, some groups of women remain marginalized from parties’ electoral agendas. Our findings extend the empirical and analytical understanding of how political parties make gendered appeals during election times and to whom. We argue the way parties seek to appeal to the diversity of women is important for the analysis of both issue ownership and interparty competition for women’s votes. Additionally, we make a normative case for parties to recognize diversity and intersectionality in their manifesto policy promises.",Article,1.0, Journal of Elections Public Opinion and Parties,Sep 16,0,"

"COVID‐19 lockdowns, intimate partner violence and coercive control","['Ciara Smyth', 'Patricia Cullen', 'Jan Breckenridge[...]', 'kylie valentine']","2020 was a year like no other, with the COVID‐19 virus upending life as we know it. When governments around the world imposed lockdown measures to curb the spread of COVID‐19, advocates in the domestic and family violence (DFV) sector recognised that these measures were likely to result in increases in violence against women, particularly intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV can take many forms, including physical, emotional, psychological, financial, coercive controlling behaviours, surveillance and isolation tactics. Lockdown conditions provide fertile ground for the exercise of coercive control by encouraging people to stay at home, limiting social interactions to household members, reducing mobility and enabling perpetrators to closely monitor their partner's movements. However, media reports and awareness of IPV are generally dominated by a focus on physical violence and lethality, which are easily defined and measured. By contrast, coercive control as a concept is difficult to operationalise, measure and action in law, policy and frontline interventions. This paper discusses the challenges inherent in measuring coercive control and engages with current debates around the criminalisation of coercive control in NSW. Such reflection is timely as the conditions of COVID‐19 lockdowns are likely to lead to an increase in coercive controlling behaviours.",Article,1.0, The Australian journal of social issues,Apr 30,0,"

-3 - SUPPORT FOR THE SALIVATION-EGESTION HYPOTHESIS FOR XYLELLA FASTIDIOSA INOCULATION: BACTERIAL CELLS CAN PENETRATE VECTOR SALIVA IN XYLEM Principal Investigator: Researcher,"['Elaine Backus', 'Kim Andrews']","Research is underway to develop varieties of grape that are resistant to Pierce's disease (PD) caused by Xylella fastidiosa (Xf). PD has become economically important since introduction of an exotic vector, glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS). However, achieving resistance to vector acquisition and inoculation is hampered by lack of knowledge of the Xf inoculation mechanism, despite nearly 70 years of research on this topic. Recent work suggests that bacterial cells spread from the cibarium (the retention reservoir) into the precibarium, from which inoculation occurs. Backus's recently published salivation-egestion hypothesis for inoculation proposes that saliva is brought up into the precibarium, where it is mechanically swept across taste organs by the precibarial valve. This mechanical action, combined with the enzymatic action of the saliva, dislodges bacteria in the precibarium, which are then forcefully egested (expelled) out of the stylets in a mixture of plant fluid and saliva that enters a xylem cell. The present preliminary study tested whether Xf bacteria can penetrate existing, hardened GWSS salivary sheaths. GWSS were allowed to feed for 24 hours on a grape stem, depositing salivary sheaths. After the insects were removed, the stem was needle-inoculated with Xf in the feeding area, then immunoprobed for Xf and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results showed Xf-lined needle punctures into xylem cells. Xf bacteria were drawn into xylem vessels and traveled varying distances from the punctures. Bacteria encountered and penetrated into undamaged, existing sheath saliva in xylem cells. The apparent ability of bacteria to penetrate into hardened sheaths suggests that Xf should be able to migrate out of newly-secreted

Enabling Pathways for Students from Refugee and Asylum-Seeker Backgrounds in Higher Education: Aspirations About Progression to Postgraduate Studies,"['Catherine Clark', 'Caroline Lenette']","University students from refugee and asylum-seeker backgrounds (SRABs) have unique resettlement experiences related to disrupted education, family expectations, financial pressures, and visa uncertainty. These arduous experiences often translate into a strong determination to access education and persevere with tertiary studies. Supportive educational trajectories are crucial to increase social cohesion and help redress the personal and social disadvantages SRABs face. Yet, there is virtually no attention paid to aspirations about progression to postgraduate studies despite the diverse aspirations and talents of many. This article reports on a qualitative study that explored the perspectives of six SRABs and two academics at an Australian university on aspirations to postgraduate studies. Participants identified several obstacles and opportunities at personal, institutional, community, and policy levels. Many existing recommendations in the enabling pathways literature focus on what universities could do differently, but we argue for a whole-of-person approach that considers institutional as well as personal issues, to increase prospects of SRABs progressing to postgraduate studies. Universities can assist with better institutional support structures, mentoring, raising staff awareness about SRABs, and financial aid. While institutions might not be able to directly address financial, visa, and personal concerns, universities can implement simple strategies to minimise their impact.",Article,0.0, Refugee Survey Quarterly,,1,"

The logic of industrial capitalism versus the logic of Inuit thinking – denied interconnectedness and how it inhibits broad-based action in the human rights and environmental spaces,['Joseph Alizzi'],"This article is a preliminary examination on the experience of relation with physical and conceptual objects in space and how this relation generally affects broad-based action in regard to human rights violations or environmental exploitation. The article suggests that a felt awareness arising from an understanding of interconnectedness is often inhibited or obscured due to an inscribed logic emanating from industrial capitalism. This logic broadly dominates the individual and commonly shared spaces, and creates a distance that inhibits a felt relation with the life-sustaining aspects of objects from developing. The article explores how humans construct value and a commensurate morality towards objects, and how the neoliberal logic suppressing notions of interconnectedness is inhibiting the capacity of the institutional human rights and environmental domains to engender broad-based action. The article critiques this logic by drawing on logic emanating from indigenous spaces, where certain indigenous ways of object- imagining and relation more clearly reveal social and environmental interconnectedness, providing instructive lessons on the connection between a felt relation and responsiveness.

However, use of this method in Australia is low. To better understand women’s views and experiences of the female condom, we conducted an interventional cross-sectional study. Methods Cisgender women ≥16 years, heterosexually active and living in New South Wales were recruited through social media advertisements and email invitations to clients of a family planning service. Eligible participants were provided with three female condoms and invited to complete a follow-up survey. Survey responses for women who attempted to use at least one female condom were summarised using counts and proportions. Results We recruited 556 women; few (30/556) had used the female condom before the study. There were 284 women who used, or attempted to use, a female condom during the study and completed the follow-up survey. Fifty-one percent (104/205) reported experiencing some difficulty in insertion, although only 46% (130/284) had seen an instructional demonstration. Approximately half (105/204) of women rated the sensation and comfort of the female condom as the same or better than the male condom, and 66% (137/204) reported that it provided the same or better lubrication. Approximately half of women said they would consider using the female condom again for STI prevention (51% (133/260)) or contraception (40% (103/260)), or would recommend to others (43% (112/260)). Conclusion Findings highlight the need for increased health promotion and education regarding use of the female condom. To increase access it will be important to address method cost and availability in Australia.

Stranded at Sea: Photographic Representations of the Rohingya in the 2015 Bay of Bengal Crisis,"['Jenny Yeung', 'Caroline Lenette']","Visual representations can contribute to shaping how the general public perceives and engages with issues of forced migration. In 2015, thousands of Rohingya became stranded in the Bay of Bengal when smugglers abandoned them on unseaworthy boats and regional governments refused their disembarkation. Their ordeal made headlines across the globe and photographs documenting the crisis were widely disseminated. This paper applies visual-social semiotics to four of these photographs from an Agence France-Presse public exhibition. Our analysis suggests that the features in the photographs transcend the conventional “threat versus victim” dualism that typically characterizes such representations, to capture both the suffering and agency of the people at the centre of the crisis. This occurs in two ways: first, the Rohingya are depicted as proactive and enacting agency, and not just as powerless people in need of rescue. Second, the juxtaposition of mundane aspects with more dramatic frames offers a tangible pathway for viewers to connect with the circumstances of the people depicted. These visual representations were effective in triggering international concern and policy responses in 2015. However, such photographs’ longer-term potential for shifting public perceptions of displacement and forced migration—and by extension, effective policy measures—remains largely indeterminate.",Article,8.0, Qualitative Report,,0,"

The Latent Digital Divides and Its Drivers in E-Learning: Among Bangladeshi Student During COVID-19 Pandemic,"['Md Badiuzzaman', 'Md. Rafiquzzaman', 'Md Insiat Islam Rabby', 'Mohammad Mustaneer Rahman']","The devastating COVID-19 pandemic forced academia to go virtual. Educational institutions around the world have stressed online learning programs in the aftermath of the pandemic. However, because of insufficient access to ICT, a substantial number of students failed to harness the opportunity of online learning. This study explores the latent digital divide exhibited during the COVID-19 pandemic while online learning activities are emphasized among Bangladeshi students. It also investigates the digital divide exposure and the significant underlying drivers of the divide. A cross-sectional survey was employed to collect quantitative data mixed with open-ended questions to collect qualitative information from the student community. The findings revealed that despite the majority of students have physical access to ICT but only 32.5% of students could attend online classes seamlessly, 34.1% of the students reported the data prices as the critical barrier, and 39.8% of students identified the poor network infrastructure is the significant barrier for them to participate in online learning activities. Although most students possess physical access to the device and the Internet, they face the first-level digital divide due to the quality of access and maintaining subscriptions. Consequently, they fail to take advantage of physical access, resulting in the third-level digital divide (Utility Gap) and submerging them into a digital divide cycle. This paper aimed to explore the underlying issues of the digital divide among Bangladeshi students to assist relevant stakeholders (e.g., the Bangladesh government, Educational Institutions, Researchers) in providing the necessary insights and theoretical understanding to arrange adequate su

On being Ignored,['Joyce Wu'],"Racism in universities to be best described as “being ignored”. This means not having complaints heard, or having your existence and identities overlooked. Being ignored is a powerful tool used by racist institutions to suppress experiences of race and gender inequality. Being ignored is also an effective way to undermine your sense of self and the validity of your experience.

Environmental Movements in Asia,['Fengshi Wu'],"The central inquiry of this chapter is the relationship between political liberalization and the rise and development of environmental movement. The selection of the eight cases (China, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Japan, Mongolia, Singapore, South Korea, and Vietnam) is guided by both the call for broad coverage of Asia and the logic of comparative politics so that this research will be able to generate a level of theoretical discussion, in addition to empirically mapping out environmental movements in Asia. In addition to outlining the main patterns of the environmental-political dual transformation, this research also discusses possible reasons for the initial synergy between political liberalization and environmental movement to fade away and the challenges of environmental protection for both young democracies and authoritarian regimes.",Preprint,,,,1,"

"""I need you all to understand how pervasive this issue is"": User efforts to regulate child sexual offending on social media","['Michael Salter', 'Elly Hanson']","This chapter examines the phenomenon of internet users attempting to report and prevent online child sexual exploitation (CSE) and child sexual abuse material (CSAM) in the absence of adequate intervention by internet service providers, social media platforms, and government. The chapter discusses the history of online CSE, focusing on regulatory stances over time in which online risks to children have been cast as natural and inevitable by the hegemony of a “cyber-libertarian” ideology. We illustrate the success of this ideology, as well as its profound contradictions and ethical failures, by presenting key examples in which internet users have taken decisive action to prevent online CSE and promote the removal of CSAM. Rejecting simplistic characterizations of “vigilante justice,” we argue instead that the fact that often young internet users are being forced to act against online CSE and CSAM puts a lie to libertarian claims that internet regulation is impossible, unworkable, and unwanted. Recent shifts towards a more progressive ethos of online harm minimization are promising, however, this ethos risks offering a new legitimizing ideology for online business models that will continue to put children at risk of abuse and exploitation. In conclusion, we suggest ways forward toward an internet built in the interests of children, rather than profit.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Cambridge Review of International Affairs ISSN: (Print) ( Brazilian foreign policy under Jair Bolsonaro: far- right populism and the rejection of the liberal international order Brazilian foreign policy under Jair Bolsonaro: far-right populism and the rejection of the liberal international order,"['Déborah BL Farias', 'Leal Farias', 'Paixão E Casarões[...]', 'Guilherme Casarões']","This paper engages with debates over the Liberal International Order (LIO) and Latin America by focusing on Brazil. More specifically, it addresses President Jair Bolsonaro's foreign policy. His radical-right populist and religious-infused approach has been characterized by an explicit rejection of practically all elements of the LIO, including multilateralism, multiculturism, and regionalism-historically core features of Brazilian foreign policy. We seek to answer two interrelated questions: (1) what were the political conditions-domestic and international-that allowed for such dramatic foreign policy change? (2) what impact is Brazil's new foreign policy orientation having on the LIO? To address them, we resort to the aspirational constructivist theory, which has allowed us to theorize Brazil's new identity formation. We argue that Bolsonaro has reshaped Brazil's foreign policy as part of his endeavour to create a national self-image based on three pillars: anti-globalism, anti-Communism, and religious nationalism. By doing so, the Bolsonaro administration has transformed Brazil, otherwise an avid supporter of the LIO, into one of the order's most vocal critics. While anti-globalism (and, subsidiarily, anti-Communism) undermines the normative and institutional foundations of the LIO, religious nationalism offers a replacement to the order, based on independent ethno-nationalist communities. If Brazil's radical right populist model spreads across Latin America, it has the potential to hollow out the region's support to the LIO.",Article,1.0, Cambridge Review of International Affairs,,0,"

Oiling the Rigs of State-building: A Political Settlements Analysis of Petroleum Revenue Management in Timor-Leste,"['Dahlia Simangan', 'Srinjoy Bose']","Timor-Leste’s extractive industry became economically and politically important during the post-conflict transition period. The government established the Petroleum Fund in 2005 to protect the economy from a “resource curse.” However, the management of the Fund has since become a source of controversy as it created opportunities for corruption and unsustainable spending practices. We argue in this article that political dynamics, in addition to if not more than weak institutions, engendered corruption, clientelist rule, and economic disenfranchisement in postconflict Timor-Leste. Using the Political Settlements approach as an analytical framework, we demonstrate that patronage, rivalry, and rent seeking in the management of petroleum revenues are associated with economic and political challenges in Timor-Leste’s state-building process.",Article,,,,0,"

Teaching for diversity: university educators’ accounts of care work and emotional labour with CALD students,"['Sally Baker', 'Clemence Due', 'Prasheela Karan', 'Megan Rose']","The massification of higher education has resulted in a highly diverse student body. Within this expansion, the increased number of Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) students has unquestionably enriched university campuses, but has also brought challenges for teaching and learning within higher education systems. There are limited accounts in the scholarly literature with regard to university educators’ perspectives of their teaching and students. In particular, limited attention has been paid to the care-related and emotional dimensions of teaching diverse cohorts. Through a mixed-method study of university educators, this paper provides a thematic analysis of university educators’ experiences of teaching CALD students, including their reflections on students’ specific needs, the existing supports offered and suggestions as to what supports are needed. It considers the visibility of the care work and emotional labour educators undertake, and problematises how this work is created by institutional assumptions but rarely recognised as legitimate ‘work’.",Article,1.0, Teaching in Higher Education,,0,"

The Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights of Young People with Intellectual Disability: A Scoping Review,"['Allison Carter', 'Iva Strnadová', 'Chloe Watfern[...]', 'Christy E Newman']","IntroductionWe examined the breadth of research on sex, sexuality, and sexual and reproductive health and rights with young people with intellectual disability in the past two decades.Methods An inclusive scoping approach focused on agency and resilience was used to review studies in English-speaking, high-income countries (2000–2019).ResultsIn the 68 studies included, we found positive examples of sexual and reproductive agency across five key domains: 1) sexual development including sexual desire, identities, relationships, and menstruation, 2) sexual knowledge including sexuality education and sexual self-advocacy, 3) sexual activity and contraceptive use, 4) access to HPV immunization and cervical cancer screening, and 5) pregnancy, childbirth, and parenthood. The strongest factors in enabling agency were social support and sexuality education. However, several barriers including paternalist attitudes and infantilization of young people with intellectual disability affected all aspects of sexual expression, leading to the persistence of unfair and avoidable health inequities over the past two decades.Conclusions Ensuring young people with intellectual disability have a voice on all matters affecting their bodies, even if they have high support needs, is essential to promoting sexual and reproductive health and rights for all.Policy ImplicationsAnti-ableist policies in sexual and reproduction health (e.g., education curriculum, service delivery) are key to moving forward.",Article,1.0, Sexuality Research and Social Policy,,1,"

Beyond deficit: ‘strengths‐based approaches’ in Indigenous health research,"['Joanne Bryant', 'Reuben Bolt', 'Jessica R Botfield[...]', 'Peter Aggleton']","Health research concerning Indigenous peoples has been strongly characterised by deficit discourse—a ‘mode of thinking’ that is overly focused on risk behaviours and problems. Strengths‐based approaches offer a different perspective by promoting a set of values that recognise the capacities and capabilities of Indigenous peoples. In this article, we seek to understand the conceptual basis of strengths‐based approaches as currently presented in health research. We propose that three main approaches exist: ‘resilience’ approaches concerned with the personal skills of individuals; ‘social–ecological’ approaches, which focus on the individual, community and structural aspects of a person's environment; and ‘sociocultural’ approaches, which view ‘strengths’ as social relations, collective identities and practices. We suggest that neither ‘resilience’ nor ‘social–ecological’ approaches sufficiently problematise deficit discourse because they remain largely informed by Western concepts of individualised rationality and, as a result, rest on logics that support notions of absence and deficit. In contrast, sociocultural approaches tend to view ‘strengths’ not as qualities possessed by individuals, but as the structure and character of social relations, collective practices and identities. As such, they are better able to capture Indigenous ways of knowing and being and provide a stronger basis on which to build meaningful interventions.",Literature Review,1.0, Sociology of Health & Illness,Jun 21,0,"

Evidence supporting the Egestion-Salivation Hypothesis for inoculation of Xylella fastidiosa by sharpshooter vectors,"['Elaine Backus', 'Kim Andrews', 'John M. Labavitch', 'Carl Greve']","Despite more than 70 years of study, the mechanism of inoculation of semipersistent, foregut-borne plant pathogens by their vectors is still unknown. The best model system for these studies is inoculation of the Pierces disease bacterium, Xylella fastidiosa (Xf), by vectors such as the glassy-winged sharpshooter GWSS). Research on the egestion-salivation hypothesis for Xf inoculation is presented. Two important steps in this hypothesis are: 1) uptake of saliva containing the cell wall-degrading enzyme beta-1,4 glucanase into the vectors precibarium, causing the Xf colonies attached therein to loosen from the cuticle, followed by 2) injection of saliva containing loosened bacteria into the xylem prior to ingestion. To directly test the likelihood that Xf could survive in and migrate out of saliva following inoculation, immunohistology was used to study interactions between Xf and GWSS saliva in grapevine. Adult GWSS were confined in small cages on grapevine stems for 24 hours and allowed to probe, leaving salivary sheaths in the plant. Xf was then needle-inoculated into the same stem area; 1 hour later, the tissue was excised and prepared for immunohistology using a commercial Xf probe. Xf bacteria observed in xylem cells penetrated the semi-viscous saliva deposited during GWSS probing prior to Xf inoculation. Therefore, Xf bacteria have the ability to infiltrate gelled saliva containing salivary glucanase. Implications for the mechanism of inoculation are discussed.",Conference Paper,,,,0,"

The Trichan takedown: Lessons in the governance and regulation of child sexual abuse material,['Michael Salter'],"en Amidst renewed concern about the prevalence of online child sexual abuse material, the global technology sector is refocusing on models of multistakeholder governance and the development of new technological solutions. This paper argues that the language of multistakeholderism and technological solutionism obscures the administrative and commercial practices that facilitate the widespread distribution of abuse material. To illustrate this point, the paper describes the 2019 intervention of the Canadian Centre for Child Protection in the operations of “Trichan”, three websites that were amongst the largest purveyors of abuse material on the open web for 7 years. The case study underscores the materiality of the Internet and the role of commercial relations within the infrastructure stack in the provision of illegal content. While identifying opportunities for the mass removal of abuse material, the paper questions the discretion granted to technology companies under laissez faire regulation, and troubles characterizations of Internet infrastructure as neutral and instrumental factors in the epidemic availability of abuse material. 摘要 zh 在有关网络儿童性虐待内容盛行的新一轮关切中，全球科技部门正重新聚焦于多利益攸关方治理的模式和新技术解决措施的发展。本文主张，多利益攸关方主义（multi‐stakeholderism）和技术解决主义（technological solutionism）的表达方式模糊了那些帮助广泛散布虐待内容的管理实践和商业实践。为阐明这一点，本文描述了2019年加拿大儿童保护中心在“Trichan”操作中的干预，Trichan是7年来开放网络（open

"The Origins of Football: History, Ideology and the Making of 'The People's Game'",['Gavin Kitching'],"Recent scholarship on the origins of association football has been marked by a highly ideological debate on its ‘class’ nature. The traditional story – of a game created by ‘gentlemen’ but taken up, and ultimately dominated, by ‘ruffians’ – has been challenged by a revisionist account which presents football as an ancient ‘people’s’ or ‘plebeian’ game, briefly hijacked by upper-middle class men in the mid-Victorian period, before returning to its ‘popular’ roots from the 1880s onwards. This article suggests that, as currently conducted, the debate is both conceptually confused and bedevilled by paucity of sources. The conceptual problems derive partly from an endemic vagueness in the historical use of the term ‘football’, and partly from a persistent tendency to conflate football play with rules of play. The paucity of sources is well-known in the study of football as a medieval and early modern folk pastime. But it is also an issue in studying early forms of club football. This article uses a hitherto underused source – the match reports of the earliest amateur football clubs in Britain – as part of an attempt to address the conceptual confusion and also to present a genuinely new account of the impact of traditional ‘folk’ football on the modern game. It is suggested that the impact was both real and very short-lived.",Article,5.0, History Workshop Journal,3d ago,1,"

Can Cameron Capture Women's Votes?

Subsequently, the Conservative Party leadership intensified efforts to attract women voters through recruiting more women MPs and in its policy messages and proposals and in 2005 and 2010 the gender gap was largely neutralised. However, in the contestation for women's votes at the next election we argue Conservative strategies are hampered by weaknesses in their symbolic, descriptive and substantive representation of women and they are unlikely to restore the Party's historical dominance with women voters with potentially serious consequences for the likelihood of a Conservative majority.",Article,4.0, Parliamentary Affairs,,0,"

Opportunities for drowning interventions using existing government policy and programmes in India,"['Medhavi Gupta', 'Anthony Zwi', 'J Jagnoor']","Background Children living in coastal, rural India face a particularly high risk of drowning due to rurality, presence of open water, lack of accessible health systems and poor infrastructure. No drowning interventions are currently implemented in India. Interventions that build on existing policy targets or government programs are more likely to be sustainable and scalable. Methods For the first time to our knowledge for an injury-related issue in India, detailed content review of policy was conducted to identify both policy principles and/or specific government programs that may be leveraged for drowning interventions. The reach, enablers and barriers of these programs were assessed through a systematic literature review. Identified policies and programs were also assessed on how they catered for underserved groups and took into consideration equity. Results Three programs may be leveraged for drowning interventions: The Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), Self-Help Group (SHG) and Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) programs. All three had high coverage and considered underserved groups such as women and rural populations. Conclusions Programs targeting specific health outcomes should consider interventions outside of the health sector that address social determinants of health. This may enable the program to better align with relevant government agendas and increase sustainability. Key messages This is the first systematic analysis of both policy content and execution of government programs to provide comprehensive insights into possible implementation strategies for an injury intervention.

The primary research question was ‘‘How do mothers describe their children’s involvement in technology-facilitated coercive control?”. This article is based on incidental findings from a larger study on Australian women’s experiences of technology-facilitated abuse in the context of domestic violence. Although children were not the focus of the study, semi-structured interviews with twelve mothers yielded discussion of children’s involvement in the abuse. We used thematic analysis to identify key dynamics and contexts of this abuse. We found that mothers and their children are co-victims of coercive control. Mothers interviewed for the study reported that children were involved in technology-facilitated coercive control directly and indirectly. This study bridges the gap between the extant research on children and coercive control and technology-facilitated abuse by highlighting the ways children are involved in technology-facilitated coercive control.

The paper draws on submissions to the 2018 Australian Senate Parliamentary Inquiry into Adoption Reform from Aboriginal community controlled organizations and highlights four common themes evident throughout these submissions: (i) the role of intergenerational trauma in high rates of Aboriginal child removal; (ii) the place of children within Aboriginal culture, kinship and identity; (iii) the centrality of the principles of self-determination and autonomy for Aboriginal communities and (iv) Aboriginal community controlled alternatives to child removal. Acknowledging the failure of both federal and state reforms to address the issues raised in these submissions, the paper reflects on the marginalization of Aboriginal voices and solutions within contemporary efforts to address the multiple crises of the child protection system and the implications for the future of Aboriginal children.",Article,1.0, Child & Family Social Work,Jul 26,0,"

Women and Stigma: A Protocol for Understanding Intersections of Experience through Body Mapping,"['Katherine Boydell', 'Jill Bennett', 'Angela Helen Dew[...]', 'Ruth Wells']","This paper outlines a research and dissemination protocol to be undertaken with specific groups of marginalised women in Australia. Women impacted by significant mental distress, disability, or refugee status are among society’s most vulnerable and disenfranchised groups. They can experience significant social exclusion, marginalisation and stigma, associated with reduced help seeking, deprivation of dignity and human rights, and threats to health, well-being and quality of life. Previous research has assessed the experiences of discrete groups of women but has to date failed to consider mental health–refugee–disability intersections and overlaps in experience. Using body mapping, this research applies an intersectional approach to identify how women impacted by significant mental distress, disability, and refugee status negotiate stigma and marginalisation. Findings on strategies to cope with, negotiate and resist stigmatised identities will inform health policy and yield targeted interventions informed by much-needed insights on women’s embodied experience of stigma. The women’s body maps will be exhibited publicly as part of an integrated knowledge translation strategy. The aim is to promote and increase sensitivity and empathy among practitioners and policy makers, strengthening the basis for social policy deliberation.",Article,0.0, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,1,"

Queering crimes of torture: A (re)imagining of torture in International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia jurisprudence,['Caitlin Biddolph'],"International criminal justice mechanisms are guided by their mandates to hold individuals accountable for grave breaches of international humanitarian law. Within this body of law, a host of crimes are listed as prohibited, and if committed, could land individuals before national or international courts. While the legal categorisation of violence into discrete crimes serves the procedural justice of the courtroom, it simultaneously erases the overlapping, entangled, and messy practice of violence. In this paper, I engage in a queer (re)imagining of the legal category of the crime of torture, as defined and practiced at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). A queer reading of witness testimonies reveals the multiplicities and contingencies that constitute torture, but also exposes the logics of gender and sexuality that make the practice and prosecution of torture legible. I argue that the ICTY jurisprudence both erases and embraces the complicated ways that torture is practiced and embodied. A queer reading of this case offers opportunities to expand definitions and applications of torture in contemporary mechanisms of international criminal justice.",Article,1.0, Australian Journal of Human Rights,,0,"

A comprehensive search of peer-reviewed literature will be performed in EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, LILACs, Informit and Business Source Premier. The grey literature search will include grey literature databases, customised Google search engines, targeted websites, and consultation with experts. The search strategy will consist of four concepts, combined as follows: (1) indigenous peoples AND (2) community program AND (3) food security OR (4) water security. Covidence will be used for study screening and data extraction by two authors. A deductive thematic analysis using indigenous-informed methodologies will be used to synthesise data. This review seeks to provide insight on models and mechanisms to encourage action and metrics for quantifying success of indigenous community-led programs to improve food and water security.",Article,1.0, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,Jun 11,0,"

Political cartoons and host nations' public dispositions toward integration,['Caroline Lenette'],"Political cartoons can reflect particular ideologies or events at the forefront of public discourse or debate in a “snapshot,” and be effective in capturing incongruences in political rhetoric through satire and caricature. In Australia and overseas, there is an abundance of political cartoons depicting refugee policy tensions. However, there is surprisingly little analysis on how cartoons impact opinions about refugees and shape public dispositions toward the issue, despite the relevance of social relations and public perceptions as key determinants of refugees’ positive integration. This article provides preliminary reflections on how political cartoons convey the complexities and tensions linked to refugee policy using three examples, and highlights their so far neglected potential to shape host nations’ public dispositions toward integration.",Article,8.0, Peace and Conflict Journal of Peace Psychology,,0,"

Digital footprints of #MeToo,"['Rachel Loney-Howes', 'Kaitlynn Mendes', 'Diana Fernández Romero[...]', 'Sonia Núñez Puente']","When #MeToo exploded onto social media in October 2017, it dramatically ruptured public consciousness in revealing the widespread nature of sexual harassment and violence around the world. Yet, despite the global attention afforded to #MeToo, it was preceded by numerous initiatives, which we argue created digital footprints instrumental in rendering #MeToo intelligible. As such, the aim of this article is two-fold. Firstly, it offers the first attempt to map a diverse range of initiatives which have mobilized to fight sexual violence, and in doing so, makes visible the global genealogy of digital feminist activism responding to sexualised violence. Secondly, building on these digital footprints and looking towards the future of digital feminist activism, the article demonstrates the power and potential of initiatives that expose the structural conditions enabling sexual violence to occur through the collective sharing of experiences across cybernetworks via processes of “ethical witnessing.” We conclude by advocating for greater recognition of those voices and experiences that feminist scholars and activists alike continue to fail to witness and call for greater efforts to archive the genealogy of digital feminist mobilisation in order to capture the complexity and diversity of its past, present and future.",Article,1.0, Feminist Media Studies,,0,"

Queering temporalities of international criminal justice: Srebrenica remembrance and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY),['Caitlin Biddolph'],"The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY, or the Tribunal) completed its mandate in 2017, marking the end of its 24-year lifespan. While the ICTY has officially ceased operations, the implications of the Tribunal’s closure continue to manifest in contemporary settings of transitional justice. Embracing a queer approach to time, the ICTY can be better understood as temporally fluid, open, and contested, rather than confined to its establishment and closure. This is because as a site for the (re)production and (re)presentation of discourses, the ICTY transcends temporal boundaries, continuing to shape and constitute (post-)conflict and transitional contexts. In this paper, I deploy queer approaches to time to interrogate how discourses of gender, sexuality, and violence at the ICTY traverse legal-political temporalities. Using the Tribunal’s Srebrenica remembrance as a case study, I demonstrate how gendered and sexualised logics constituted at the ICTY exceed the Tribunal’s official temporal mandate. Adopting a queer approach to time, I argue that gendered memories of violence at the ICTY permeate temporalities of international justice and global politics.",Article,1.0, Griffith Law Review,,0,"

Women and Nordic labour parties,"['Buchanan Guro', 'Claire Annesley']","This chapter explores the strategies used by social-democratic parties in Norway and Sweden to feminise politics, and evaluates the extent to which New Labour can learn from these states. It provides a review of the opportunities for a feminisation of politics in these countries since the 1970s, under the headings of women's substantive representation, women in the core executive, state feminism, and women's-policy platform to gain female votes. The chapter then reports the respective degrees of ‘women-friendliness’ in the economy, welfare state, and foreign policy. Some pointers to New Labour regarding how a party can make a difference to women's lives and the pitfalls that it might encounter along the way are presented. Progress towards women-friendly policies since the 1970s has been instrumental rather than ideological. The chapter also illustrates that little can be achieved without well-developed parental leave and a cash-support system.",Chapter,,,,0,"

"Carnival, Sexual Violence and Harm at Australian Music Festivals","['Phillip Wadds', 'Bianca Fileborn', 'Stephen Tomsen']","Much has been written about the search for carnivalesque release in late-modern society, but relatively less attention has been paid to the harms experienced within this practice. Based on mixed-methods qualitative research including observational fieldwork at a large, multi-day camping festival in NSW, Australia, and in-depth interviews with victim-survivors of sexual violence occurring at Australian music festivals, this paper considers music festivals as sites of contemporary carnival. The paper examines the way in which situational, environmental and gendered dynamics shape these transgressive experiences. In doing so, it advances cultural criminological understandings of the carnivalesque by highlighting the bounded nature of carnival and the ‘cultural scaffolding’ that enables sexual violence and harassment at music festival events.",Article,1.0, British Journal of Criminology,,0,"

Pragmatic strategies to reduce the digital divide in the online class and improve interaction to increase outcomes,"['Md Badiuzzaman', 'Mohammad Mustaneer Rahman']","Online classes are becoming increasingly popular in this technological era and, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become the mainstream practise (UN, 2020). Due to the unprecedented health risks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, 188 nations across the globe have implemented a safety regulation prohibiting direct instruction in educational institutions. Most countries have adopted online classes as a substitute for traditional face-to-face classes (Petretto et al., 2020). This indicates that perhaps this pandemic will lead to long-term reformation in the future education system, making online learning-teaching an integral part of traditional education in the future. For example, according to the UN (2020), numerous higher education programs have successfully been implemented online. According to UN (2020) data, approximately all European and Latin American countries have adopted online learning amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, approximately 60% of African countries have introduced online learning, which is significantly lower. Although online classes seemly effective, this introduces new forms of inequalities (Badiuzzaman et al., 2021; Petretto et al., 2020; UNESCO, 2020). UNESCO has warned that considering online learning as the way ahead for everyone is a delusion (UNESCO, 2020). Empirical evidence found that many students are deprived of onlineclasses in developing countries due to various forms of the digital divide (Badiuzzaman et al., 2021; UN, 2020). Along with these digital divide issues, lack of interaction in class, lack of technical skills of teachers and students, dearth of parental awareness cumulatively affecting the utility of online classes.

Australia and the Rules of International Trade and Finance,['Elizabeth Thurbon'],"Throughout the second half of the Twentieth Century, Australia was a fierce advocate and defender of the multilateral rules-based economic order. Since the early 2000s however, the Australian government has privileged the pursuit of preferential trade and investment agreements, and now sees the pursuit of preferential deals as central to the advancement of its broader foreign policy goals. In this chapter, I assess Australia's contribution to the rules-based international order in trade and finance from the end of WWII to the present. I also examine the relationship between Australia's trade and investment policy approach and its broader foreign policy objectives by asking: are the economic rules Australia is promoting likely to advance or undermine its stated foreign policy goals? My aim is to advance debate about the most desirable future direction of Australia's foreign economic policy agenda.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Re-examining the gap: A critical realist analysis of eye health inequity among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians,"['Aryati Yashadhana', 'Ted Fields', 'Anthea Burnett', 'Anthony Zwi']","The prevalence of diabetes among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter ‘Aboriginal’) Australians is three times greater than non-Aboriginal Australians, contributing to a greater risk of blindness from treatable and preventable ocular conditions, most prominently cataract and diabetic retinopathy. In rural and remote Aboriginal communities, blindness prevalence is higher, and ocular treatment coverage and uptake are lower. In collaboration with Aboriginal Community Based Researchers (CBRs), this study explored complex contingent factors that shape access to eye health services for rural and remote Aboriginal Australians living with diabetes. Interviews (n = 126) and focus groups (n = 12) were conducted with patients, primary care clinicians, and CBRs, in four rural communities in the Northern Territory and New South Wales. Factors internal and external to health systems were examined, drawing on Bourdieu's concepts of habitus, and doxa to understand agency and decision-making among patients and clinicians. The study used the ontology of critical realism, categorising contingent factors as underlying structures (generative mechanisms), and applying a decolonising approach that centred causal relationships and tensions between dominant (Western biomedical neoliberalism) and non-dominant (Aboriginal) value systems. Three forms of marginalisation; linguistic, economic, and cultural, were identified as the generative mechanisms that inhibit equitable eye health outcomes. Marginality is linked to structural factors that position Aboriginal culture as a barrier, and is reinforced through biomedical health systems, and the agents who operate in and influence them. In order to address eye health inequity, a shift in how

‘To the Arabic Community Disability Is Not Normal’: Multiple Stakeholder Perceptions of the Understandings of Disability among Iraqi and Syrian People from Refugee Backgrounds,"['Angela Helen Dew', 'Caroline Lenette', 'Louisa Smith[...]', 'Yasir Mohammad']","In 2015, the Australian government committed to take an additional 12,000 refugees from Syria and Iraq prioritizing those considered most vulnerable including people with disability. The aim of this preliminary study was to understand, from multiple stakeholder perspectives, the experiences of settling in Australia for people with disability from Syrian and Iraqi refugee backgrounds living in Sydney. Interviews were conducted with nine family members of 11 people with disability from Iraqi and Syrian refugee backgrounds; eight Iraqi and Syrian community organization leaders; and seven community and health refugee service practitioners. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using the thematic analysis. Three themes were identified that contribute to understandings of disability based on the perceptions of the multiple stakeholders interviewed: Iraqi and Syrian perceptions of ‘disability’; beliefs about who is ‘responsible for’ the disability; and comparisons between Iraqi/Syrian and Australian views, attitudes, and approaches to disability. Understandings of disability are shaped by fluid and dynamic factors, including culture. It is essential that services are offered to people with disability and their family members using a whole-of-person, culturally informed approach to community support.",Article,0.0, Journal of Refugee Studies,"Dec 26, 2020",0,"

‘In the Beginning is Relation’: Martin Buber’s Alternative to Binary Oppositions,"['Andrew Metcalfe', 'Ann Game']","In this article we develop a relational understanding of sociality, that is, an account of social life that takes relation as primary. This stands in contrast to the common assumption that relations arise when subjects interact, an account that gives logical priority to separation. We will develop this relational understanding through a reading of the work of Martin Buber, a social philosopher primarily interested in dialogue, meeting, relationship, and the irreducibility and incomparability of reality. In particular, the article contrasts Buber’s work with that of poststructuralist theorists who take as their starting point the deconstruction of the Hegelian logic of binary oppositions. Deconstruction understands difference as the excess that undoes the binary, but Buber, we argue, shows how difference derives from the primacy and ontological undefinability of relation. Relational logic does not exclude the logic of separations and oppositions: relation is the primal ground that makes separations possible.",Article,1.0, Sophia,Nov 15,0,"

“It ain’t a compliment”: Feminist data visualisation and digital street harassment advocacy,"['Bianca Fileborn', 'Verity Trott']","In an era of datafication, data visualisation is playing an increasing role in civic meaning-making processes. However, the conventions of data visualisation have been criticised for their reductiveness and rhetoric of neutrality and there have been recent efforts to develop feminist principles for designing data visualisations that are compatible with feminist epistemologies. In this article, we aim to examine how data visualisation is used in feminist activism and by feminist activists. Drawing on the example of digital street harassment activism, we analyse how street harassment is visualised in and through a selection of prominent activist social media accounts. We consider the platform affordances utilised by activists, and how these are harnessed in making street harassment ‘knowable'. Moreover, we critically interrogate which and whose experiences are ‘knowable’ via digital techniques, and what remains obscured and silenced. In analysing digital feminist activists’ practices, we argue that what constitutes ‘data visualisation’ itself must be situated within feminist epistemologies and praxis that centre lived experience as the starting point for knowledge production. Such an approach challenges and disrupts normative constructions of what constitutes data visualisation. Our findings demonstrate how feminist activists are adopting ‘traditional’ practices of speaking out and consciousness-raising to the digital sphere in the creation of a range of visualisations that represent the issue of street harassment. We consider the efficacy of these visualisations for achieving their intended purpose and how they might translate to policy and government responses, if this is indeed their goal. Further, we document a tension between feminis

information The Latent Digital Divide and Its Drivers in E-Learning among Bangladeshi Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"['Md Badiuzzaman', 'Md. Rafiquzzaman', 'Md Insiat Islam Rabby', 'Mohammad Mustaneer Rahman']","The devastating COVID-19 pandemic forced academia to go virtual. Educational institutions around the world have stressed online learning programs in the aftermath of the pandemic. However, because of insufficient access to Information Communication Technology (ICT), a substantial number of students failed to harness the opportunity of online learning. This study explores the latent digital divide exhibited during the COVID-19 pandemic while online learning activities are emphasised among students of Bangladesh. It also investigates the digital divide exposure and the significant underlying drivers of the divide. In order to accomplish this, a cross-sectional survey was employed to collect quantitative data, mixed with open-ended questions were utilised to gather qualitative information from the student community. The findings revealed that despite the majority of students having physical access to ICT, only 32.5% of students could attend online classes seamlessly. In total, 34.1% reported data prices as the critical barrier, while 39.8% identified poor network infrastructure as the significant barrier preventing them from participating in online learning activities. Although most students possess physical access to various devices and the Internet, they face the first-level digital divide due to the quality of access and price of cellular Internet. Consequently, they fail to take advantage of physical access, resulting in the third-level digital divide (utility gap), which submerges them into a digital divide cycle. The primary objective of this study is to explore the underlying issues of the digital divide among Bangladeshi students.

This study assessed the safety of subcutaneous slow-release depot buprenorphine in custody. Design Open-label, non-randomised trial. Setting Correctional centres in New South Wales, Australia. Participants Sixty-seven men and women, aged≥18 years of various security classifications with a diagnosis of moderate to severe DSM-5 opioid use disorder currently serving a custodial sentence of ≥6 months were recruited between November 2018 and July 2019. Patients not in opioid agonist treatment at recruitment commenced depot buprenorphine; patients already stable on oral methadone treatment were recruited to the comparison arm. Intervention and comparator Depot buprenorphine (CAM2038 weekly for 4 weeks then monthly) and daily oral methadone. Measurements Safety was assessed by adverse event (AE) monitoring and physical examinations at every visit. Participants were administered a survey assessing self-reported diversion and substance use at baseline, week 4 and week 16. Findings Retention in depot buprenorphine treatment was 92%. Ninety-four percent of patients reported at least one adverse event, typically mild and transient. No diversion was identified. The prevalence of self-reported non-prescribed opioid use among depot buprenorphine patients decreased significantly between baseline (97%) and week 16 (12%, OR=0.0035, 95% CI 0.0007-0.018, p<0.0001).

How not to think about the state and religious recognition,['Geoffrey Brahm Levey'],"Bouke De Vries opposes the constitutional recognition of one religion. This typically, though not always, involves the constitutional recognition of the religion shared by the historically dominant group in a society, a recognition not given to minority religions. De Vries’ objection to 'mono-recognition' is not, however, the usual arguments levelled against it. Rather, he claims to offer a novel argument showing that mono-recognition is ‘pro tanto wrong’, that is, wrong as far as it goes and until it can be otherwise justified. His argument is that it is enough that some citizens desire constitutional recognition for their religion on morally reasonable (or at least on not unreasonable) grounds for the non-recognition of their religion to be wrong. De Vries’ intervention is useful as a cautionary tale about how not to think about religious recognition and fairness in liberal democracies. It supplies three lessons. The first is that one should not try to resolve these issues in total disregard of a society’s history and culture. Lesson two is not to fixate on constitutional recognition as there are different ways of effecting political recognition and promoting a sense of belonging in a diverse society. Third, De Vries’ article inadvertently highlights the practical and moral dilemmas involved in trying to distribute recognition in a mechanical or uniform fashion. Assessing the legitimacy of the political recognition of religion and religious minorities requires a much more nuanced and context-sensitive approach than the one De Vries presents, a tiptoeing rather than a pro tantoing through the tulips.",Article,1.0, Ethnicities,,0,"

KOMUNITI SEMPADAN BA’KELALAN: ANTARA IDENTITI NASIONAL DAN IDENTITI BUDAYA,"['Yusten Karulus', 'Maine Suadik']","Border communities, particularly in Southeast Asia have a similar identity before the formation of the modern nation state. The Treaty of Westphalia 1648 has separates nation state to various national identity (Chandler, 2003). With the establishment of national borders, collectives' identity among some ethnic groups has been divided into different national identity related to their nationalities. Based on these arguments, this paper discusses the tendency of identity among the border community of Ba'kelalan, Lawas in Sarawak. Ba'kelalan is located about four kilometers from the international border of Malaysia-Indonesia on the Malaysian side. The interaction among Lun Bawang or Lun Dayeh in Ba'kelalan, Malaysia and Long Bawan, Indonesia has been going on before the border formation in this area. The close cultural and historical ties between people on both sides of the border are one of the main reasons for the intense cross-border social and economic interactions. A general phenomenon and the dynamics of political identity have been used to examine the dominant factors of national and cultural identity in the context of cross border relations. Research has been done by using ethnographic approach to the 32 informants. 2 Findings show that cross border interaction in Ba'kelalan is conspicuously about maintaining their cultural identity. Specifically, the identity of being Lun Bawang as an ethnic group is more important than being Indonesian Lun Dayeh or Malaysian Lun Bawang. However, from the phenomenon of national identity, it shows that the sense of belonging among the Lun Bawang in Ba'kelalan is located on the Malaysian side-of being Malaysian",Article,,,,0,"

We do so by synthesizing Schumpeterian understandings of 'creative destruction' and techno-economic change with cutting-edge developmental state theorizing centred on 'developmental environmentalism'. Our approach allows us to explain South Korea's mixed results in the clean energy shift over the 2008-2020 period by focussing on varying degrees of alignment between the state's 'creative' and 'destructive' ambitions and capabilities. Following a period of misalignment characterized by a creative emphasis (2008-2015), we have seen growing alignment between the state's 'creative' and 'destructive' endeavours (2015-present). On the basis of our analysis, we anticipate that Korea's hitherto mixed results are likely to give way to more consistent strides towards greening the national economy. Beyond Korea, our fresh analytical approach may be applied to other national contexts, helping to advance broader debates about the state's strategic role in the clean energy shift.",Article,1.0, The Journal of Environment & Development,May 20,0,"

Beyond Formal Ethics Reviews: Reframing the Potential Harms of Sexual Violence Research,"['Shaez Mortimer', 'Bianca Fileborn', 'Nicola Henry']","Given the recent surge of research about sexual violence, it is timely to revisit the role of ethics in this field. This article examines two key frameworks which govern ethics in sexual violence research: institutional risk management and trauma discourse. While recognising the importance of these frameworks, we argue that they share a narrow conceptualisation of the potential harms of sexual violence research. Drawing on the legacy of decades of feminist research on sexual violence, we call for a deeper engagement with ethical and epistemological questions of knowledge, positionality and power. We argue that researchers need to consider the broader social and political contexts that shape survivors’ lives and experiences of disclosure in undertaking ethical research. Sexual violence researchers must also consider the potential harms of their research on marginalised communities – from questioning who is included in research, to the implications of the responses to violence advocated for. Utilising insights from feminist, critical and intersectional traditions – and reflections on our own experiences as sexual violence researchers – we argue for ethical considerations to extend beyond risk management and medicalised trauma frameworks.",Article,1.0, Australian Feminist Studies,Oct 29,0,"

Opportunities for strengthening sexual health education in schools: Findings from a student needs assessment in NSW,"['Caecilia Roth', 'Yan Cheng', 'Eleanor Wilson[...]', 'Jane Estoesta']","Issue Addressed Comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) is important for the sexual and reproductive health of young people. To better understand young people’s views and experiences of sexual health education in NSW, a student needs assessment survey was conducted in 2017. Methods This paper presents the findings from 1,603 NSW students in Years 8-12 following online recruitment. Descriptive analyses explored students’ views and experiences in relation to sources of sexual health information, education providers, school-based topics covered and resources drawn on. Results Findings indicate that school, parents, friends and social media are students’ most common sources of information on sexual and reproductive health. Approximately one-third of students reported wanting more information on topics related to relationships, reproductive health, consent and sexual decision-making and sexual harassment, abuse and bullying, and two-thirds of transgender and gender diverse students wanted more information on gender identity. For the topics which students reported receiving the least information about at school, they were most likely to seek this out on social media and websites. Conclusion Findings provide valuable insight for improving CSE in NSW. The influence of social media, parents and the internet should be taken into consideration when developing resources and programme content. Professional development for educators could contribute to improving the quality of CSE delivered. Accurate and up to date resources must be utilised to support student engagement and effective learning.",Article,1.0, Health promotion journal of Australia: official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,,0,"

The human rights of older persons: the politics and substance of the UN Open-Ended Working Group on Ageing,['Annie Herro'],"Elder rights are the new frontier in the pluralisation of human rights yet they have been a largely neglected area of research. The United Nations (UN) has started to seriously consider establishing a Convention on the Rights of Older Persons through the Open-Ended Working Group on Ageing (OEWGA). Through qualitative and quantitative analyses of documents from the OEWGA and interviews with elder rights activists, this article examines the rights claims and subgroups of older persons that have been given primacy. It also identifies forces that have shaped the rights discourse and the implications of the dominant themes for how older persons are perceived. It argues that the political divisions and the rules of the OEWGA have prevented a consistently comprehensive discussion on the rights of older persons. It also argues that there is a risk that the emphasis on economic and social rights and older persons with disabilities by states and non-state actors might subtly reinforce the notion that elderly people are a drain on resources, a burden, and objects of welfare rather than as active contributors to societies. It concludes by proposing possible ways of avoiding these pitfalls and suggestions on widening the scope of the rights discussion and future research.",Article,7.0, Australian Journal of Human Rights,,0,"

"The Struggle for Certainty: Ontological Security, the Rise of Nationalism, and Australia-China Tensions after COVID-19","['Guangyi Pan', 'Alexander Korolev']","Australia-China relations have been relatively stable over the last decade. However, soon after the outbreak of COVID-19, Australia took an increasingly assertive stance toward China, one that is arguably even more assertive than those of its Western allies. What prompted Australia to adopt a tougher policy against China? This article argues that COVID-19 has brought significant uncertainty to the international system and, hence, to Australia’s external environment, which has affected the country’s decision-making, accelerating the formation of a hardline policy toward China. A contributing factor behind this policy is Australia’s quest for ontological security, which, in the context of COVID-19, has triggered a rise in anti-China sentiment. Meanwhile, this strategy backfired when it encountered China’s own nationalism, which exacerbated the widening political chasm, dragging the two countries into an unprecedented diplomatic confrontation. The core of ontological security lies in maintaining the stability of the identity needed for the formation of consistent policy. The uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic have changed the familiar external environment and challenged Australia’s ability to interpret this new environment and adjust to it, which has triggered ontological insecurity. By analyzing Australia’s identity as a middle power in the context of changing regional security and its commitment to certain values, the article shows how COVID-19 has accelerated Australia’s quest for ontological security, which has changed the country’s China policy.",Article,1.0, Journal of Chinese Political Science,Jan 5,1,"

Tissue-engineered nerve grafts using a scaffold-independent and injectable drug delivery system: a novel design with translational advantages,"['Yanxi Liu', 'Shuangjiang Yu', 'Xiaorong Gu[...]', 'Shusen Cui']","Objective: Currently commercially available nerve conduits have demonstrated suboptimal clinical efficacy in repairing peripheral nerve defects. Although tissue-engineered nerve grafts (TENGs) with sustained release of neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are experimentally proved to be more effective than these blank conduits, there remains a lack of clinical translation. NTFs are typically immobilized onto scaffold materials of the conduit via adsorption, specific binding or other incorporation techniques. These scaffold-based delivery strategies increase complexity and cost of conduit fabrication and lack flexibility in choosing different drugs. Therefore, to facilitate clinical translation and commercialization, we construct a TENG using a scaffold-independent drug delivery system (DDS). Approach: This study adopted a scaffold-independent DDS based on methoxy-poly (ethylene glycol)-b-poly(γ-ethyl-L-glutamate) (mPEG-PELG) thermosensitive hydrogels that undergo sol-to-gel transition at body temperature. In addition, TENG, a chitosan scaffold filled with nerve growth factor (NGF)-loaded mPEG-PELG that gel in the lumen upon injection during surgery and function as a drug-releasing conduit-filler, was designed. Subsequently, the efficacy of DDS and therapeutic effects of TENG were assessed. Main results: The results demonstrated that NGF-loaded mPEG-PELG controllably and sustainably released bioactive NGF for 28 d. When bridging a 10 mm rat sciatic nerve gap, the morphological, electrophysiological, and functional analyses revealed that NGF-releasing TENG (Scaffold + NGF/mPEG-PELG) achieved superior regenerative outcomes compared to plain scaffolds and those combined with systemi

Economic Anthropology in View of the Global Financial Crisis,['Timothy Heffernan'],"Economic anthropology is the study of how individuals and communities understand and engage with economic life, broadly conceived. This chapter provides an overview of central debates and approaches used in the subdiscipline over the past century. These debates – ranging from the form and substance of the economy, the impact of the cultural turn, and the rise of neoliberal economic policy – are explored amid changing relationships with credit and debt following the global financial crisis (GFC). Positioned between anthropology and economics, the field of economic anthropology has long sought to understand notions of exchange, ownership, consumption, value, reciprocity, production, and labor and considers how these relate to the function and maintenance of distinct cultural worlds. Analyzing central debates in historical perspective, this chapter asks how practitioners continue to engage with key ideas after the GFC. What is more, it decenters key theoretical approaches by examining the experience of the GFC from outside the global centers of finance. Through a case study of the Icelandic banking collapse as part of the GFC, questions of how credit and debt are understood in light of crisis are pursued, particularly after the collective prosperity of Iceland’s “economic miracle” in the early 2000s. It concludes with a discussion of the harms of neoliberalism and economic “virtualism” and charts emerging inquiries in economic anthropology that boast flexibility for examining economy in a changing world.",Chapter,,,Dec 13,0,"

"Renewal of the National Cervical Screening Program: health professionals' knowledge about screening of specific populations in NSW, Australia Article history Key points","['Sally Sweeney', 'Yan Cheng', 'Jessica R Botfield', 'Deborah Bateson']","Objectives: The National Cervical Screening Program was renewed in Australia from 1 December 2017, with the introduction of 5-yearly human papilloma virus (HPV) screening from age 25, and the release of updated national screening guidelines. This study aimed to determine health professional knowledge of the renewed screening program following implementation. Methods: We invited health professionals providing cervical screening in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, to complete an online survey in late 2018, to better understand their knowledge of the renewed screening guidelines, in particular regarding screening of specific populations, and to ascertain whether they had undertaken any educational activities relevant to the renewal. Results: A total of 241 responses were included in the data analysis. Health professionals demonstrated good knowledge of some aspects of the renewed program, including 64–85% correctly identifying limited indications for testing people younger than 25 years, 87% correctly identifying the need for completion of the Test of Cure protocol following treatment of high-grade lesions, and 71–80% correctly identifying management of symptomatic women. However several key knowledge gaps were identified including management of immune-deficient women (only 37% of respondents were aware of the need for 3-yearly screening), screening after total hysterectomy (56% were aware of guidance) and approximately 66% of health professionals correctly identifying indications for self-collected screening. One in ten health professionals had not undertaken any education specific to the renewal of the program. We found significant associations between knowledge levels and practitioner characteristics, including practitioners’

Disaster Justice in Nepal's Earthquake Recovery,"['Krishna K. Shrestha', 'Basundhara Bhattarai', 'Hemant Ojha', 'Ayusha Bajracharya']","Many policies on disaster governance and community resilience aim at enhancing justice outcomes at the local community level. In so doing, they tend to focus on equal distribution of a set of rights and goods among the communities. However, these rights and goods are defined by an underlying value structure, and such structures tend to mirror the interests of the powerful groups in the community. The fundamental problem is that the equality of the rights and redistribution of the goods cannot remedy disaster injustices. Taking a case study from Nepal's earthquake 2015, this paper aims to link key works on disasters with justice theories - an attempt, which could help strengthen the conceptual foundations of policy responses to disaster recovery. We use the Nepal case of earthquake recovery to demonstrate the relevance of disaster justice lens which emphasizes the role of disaster justice champions, critical politics of knowledge, accountability, representation and disaster justice convictions. We demonstrate that the platform of critical knowledge politics is important where civic science and traditional science is deliberated, interrogated, negotiated and integrated. We argue that only when disaster justice champions with convictions of priority to the disadvantaged effectively utilizes the platform of critical knowledge politics, it is possible to influence political deliberations and decision making that can potentially enhance disaster justice in practice. Finally, and in a more theoretical sense, we argue that in order to enhance disaster justice, responses need to be informed by the understanding of ‘justice as redistribution’ as well as ‘justice as recognition’.",Article,8.0, International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,Apr 12,0,"

"New Vulnerabilities for Migrants and Refugees in State Responses to the Global Pandemic, COVID-19","['Claudia Tazreiter', 'Simon Metcalfe']","This article examines the global pandemic, COVID-19, through the lens of responses to vulnerable migrants, asking what state responses mean for the future of human rights values and for humanitarian interventions. The responses of the Australian state are developed as a case study of actions and policies directed at refugees and temporary migrant workers through the COVID-19 pandemic. The theoretical framing of the article draws on racial capitalism to argue that the developments manifest during the ‘crisis times’ of COVID-19 are in large part a continuity of the exclusionary politics of bordering practices at the heart of neoliberal capitalism. The article proposes that a rethinking of foundational theoretical and methodological approaches in the social sciences are needed to reflect contemporary changes in justice claims, claims that increasingly recognize the multi-species nature of existential threats to all life.",Article,,,Sep 23,0,"

Digital mapping as feminist method: critical reflections,['Bianca Fileborn'],"Digital maps have been taken up as a productive tool in both activism and academic research. However, there has been less consideration of their use as a research method in qualitative social sciences research. This paper aims to contribute towards scholarship on qualitative research by providing a critical reflection on the use of digital mapping as a research method in a feminist research project on street-based harassment in Australia. Drawing on practices of reflexivity, as well as comments made by participants across 46 qualitative interviews, I consider how digital mapping can be used to facilitate feminist research, arguing that it represents a generative instrument which lends itself to the development of in-depth insights from participants. Yet, mapping also delimits the epistemological possibilities of qualitative research, and I consider how this method simultaneously constrains what can be known about street harassment.",Article,1.0, Qualitative Research,,0,"

The Qualitative Report Digital Storytelling in Research: A Systematic Review,"['Adele de Jager', 'Andrea S Fogarty', 'Anna Tewson[...]', 'Katherine Boydell']","Digital storytelling refers to a 2 to 5 minute audio-visual clip combining photographs, voice-over narration, and other audio (Lambert, 2009) originally applied for community development, artistic and therapeutic purposes, and more recently adapted as an arts-based research method. To date, no systematic review of the use of digital storytelling in a research capacity, to generate information about a phenomenon has been conducted. Accordingly, our aim was to provide a systematic review of digital storytelling in research. The review identified 25 articles representing 23 discrete studies that met inclusion criteria. A thematic analysis of results indicated that digital storytelling in research was especially appropriate for use with marginalised groups, and was most commonly used in this context. There was some variation in the extent to which digital storytelling in research adhered to the principles with which it was originally developed. Surprisingly, although digital storytelling provides a ready-made knowledge translation product, few research projects employed the digital stories generated to this end. Across research projects, participants reported several benefits of digital storytelling. While some disadvantages were noted, overall, these were outweighed by the benefits of using a respectful, participatory research practice. © 2017: Adële de Jager, Andrea Fogarty, Anna Tewson, Caroline Lenette, Katherine M.

Child sexual abuse material on the darknet: A script analysis of how offenders operate,"['Benoit Leclerc', 'Jacqueline Drew', 'Thomas J Holt[...]', 'Sara Singh']","The development of online technologies in recent decades has facilitated the distribution and consumption of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) over the internet, which also led to the emergence of CSAM on the darknet-the segment of the internet hidden from the general public. Using data obtained from interviews with online investigators, this study uses crime script analysis to reconstruct step-by-step how offenders operate on the darknet. The findings highlight the three phases of the script: (1) the crime setup phase, (2) the crime completion phase, and (3) the crime continuation phase. Scripting is a practical method of developing concrete ways to address this problem.

"The Danish Cartoons, Charlie Hebdo and the culture wars: satiric limits in comparative national and transnational perspectives",['Mark Rolfe'],"A considerable body of academic literature has lauded political satirists as rebellious defenders of democracy and free speech against an establishment. Although satire is not always rebellious, this reputation of satirists and of satire may itself be the object of partisan capture. In this article, it is the object of capture by right-wing populists. In that respect, satire and the meta-discourse about satire can be used like any political rhetoric in gathering like-minded allies, claiming standards, and fighting opponents. With the Danish cartoons crisis of 2005-2006 and the Charlie Hebdo massacre of 2015, proponents of culture wars rhetoric added satire to their list of Western cultural legacies that needed defence against Islamic terrorism as well as left authoritarian elites who suppressed free speech through political correctness. They constructed simplistic global political dichotomies about satire, free speech, and civilisation and lifted events out of local contexts in a process of global framing. The culture war rhetoric was absolutist in support of free speech and satire on the international level. But the national level reveals the hortatory and partisan side to this rhetoric and the complexities that belie the absolutist stand. Nations are the arenas where struggles over free speech and political humour are played out.",Article,1.0, European Journal of Humour Research,,0,"

Importance of sex education for a successful transition to life after school: Experiences of high school girls with intellectual disability,"['Iva Strnadová', 'Julie Loblinzk', 'Joanne Danker']","Accessible summary • Quality sex education is important for all students. It also helps with a successful transition to life after school. • We talked to 11 Australian high school girls with intellectual disability. We wanted to know what they think about their sex education at school. • The girls told us that they were often not included in Individual Learning Plan meetings. They were also not consulted about what they would like to learn in sex education. • Sex education classes were largely inaccessible for them. • Accessible sex education classes are important to prepare students for life after school. Abstract 1.1 Background Students with intellectual disability often do not receive holistic sex education, which is critical for their successful transition to post-school life, including having an ability to make healthy choices about their sexuality and relationships. The aim of this inclusive research study was to explore the perceptions and experiences of sex education with Australian high school girls with intellectual disability, as they prepare for a transition to post-school life. 1.2 Method There were 11 high school girls aged 13–20 years who participated in this study. Interviews were conducted and analysed using inductive content analysis. 1.3 Findings The findings indicate that critical topics such as gender and sexual identity, and masturbation are not sufficiently covered in sex education in New South Wales, Australia. The participating girls also highlighted ways in which teachers could make sex education lessons more accessible. Individual Learning Plan meetings, an important platform for transition planning, were attended by less than a third of the girls in this study. 1.4 Conclusions Comprehensive and accessible programmes on sex educati

"Impact of national guidelines on use of BRCA1/2 germline testing, risk management advice given to women with pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants and uptake of advice","['Bettina Meiser', 'R. Kaur', 'April Morrow[...]', 'Gillian Mitchell']","Background This nationwide study assessed the impact of nationally agreed cancer genetics guidelines on use of BRCA1/2 germline testing, risk management advice given by health professionals to women with pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants and uptake of such advice by patients. Methods Clinic files of 883 women who had initial proband screens for BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants at 12 familial cancer clinics between July 2008–July 2009 (i.e. before guideline release), July 2010–July 2011 and July 2012–July 2013 (both after guideline release) were audited to determine reason given for genetic testing. Separately, the clinic files of 599 female carriers without a personal history of breast/ovarian cancer who underwent BRCA1/2 predictive genetic testing and received their results pre- and post-guideline were audited to ascertain the risk management advice given by health professionals. Carriers included in this audit were invited to participate in a telephone interview to assess uptake of advice, and 329 agreed to participate. Results There were no significant changes in the percentages of tested patients meeting at least one published indication for genetic testing - 79, 77 and 78% of files met criteria before guideline, and two-, and four-years post-guideline, respectively (χ = 0.25, p = 0.88). Rates of documentation of post-test risk management advice as per guidelines increased significantly from pre- to post-guideline for 6/9 risk management strategies. The strategies with the highest compliance amongst carriers or awareness post-release of guidelines were annual magnetic resonance imaging plus mammography in women 30–50 years (97%) and annual mammography in women > 50 years (92%).

We explored service provider and advocate perspectives about the barriers and facilitators for appropriate and safe care for this group. Methods: Three focus groups with sixteen professional stakeholders examined the ways aged care support is accessible and inaccessible for Forgotten Australians. Results: Participants noted structural and organisational features that act as barriers to best practice aged care. It was perceived that funding models and processes provide insufficient opportunity to develop trust with professionals and access tailored care. Once engaged with aged care services, the sector lacks the psychological literacy required to tailor care to manage the complex needs and preferences of Forgotten Australians. Conclusion: Systemic and organisational change that promotes increased flexibility, trauma-informed care and non-residential housing options will improve the safety and accessibility of aged care for Forgotten Australians.",Article,1.0, Australasian Journal on Ageing,,0,"

Benefit of China’s Social Health Insurance Schemes: Trend Analysis and Associated Factors Since Health Reform,"['Wanyue Dong', 'Anthony Zwi', 'Ruhai Bai[...]', 'Jianmin Gao']","With the deepening of health insurance reform in China, the integration of social health insurance schemes was put on the agenda. This paper aims to illustrate the achievements and the gaps in integration by demonstrating the trends in benefits available from the three social health insurance schemes, as well as the influencing factors. Data were drawn from the three waves of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (2009, 2011, 2015) undertaken since health reforms commenced. χ2, Kruskal–Wallis test, and the Two-Part model were employed in the analysis. The overall reimbursement rate of the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) is higher than that of Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) or the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) (p < 0.001), but the gap has narrowed since health reform began in 2009. Both the outpatient and inpatient reimbursement amounts have increased through the URBMI and NRCMS. Illness severity, higher institutional level, and inpatient service were associated with significant increases in the amount of reimbursement received across the three survey waves. The health reform improved benefits covered by the URBMI and NRCMS, but gaps with the UEBMI still exist.

Embracing the future: an evaluation of sexuality workshops for parents and carers of children and young people with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders,"['Erin Donnelly', 'Ee-Lin Chang', 'Yan Cheng', 'Jessica R Botfield']","Background: Evidence shows that parents and carers are often under resourced and lacking confidence and awareness in supporting their child or young person with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with puberty, sexuality and relationships. Method: In 2018, Family Planning NSW (funded by nib Foundation) delivered six workshops to parents and carers across NSW focussing on puberty, sexuality and relationships education for children and young people with ID and ASD. Pre and post workshop surveys were completed by participants (n = 116) with a three month follow-up via online survey or telephone interview to evaluate the effectiveness of the workshop. Quantitative data was analysed using STATA 14.0. Qualitative data was summarised by theme or analysed in Nvivo using thematic analyses. Results: A significant improvement in participants’ knowledge and confidence level in providing sexuality support to their child/young person between the pre- and post-workshop survey was found across survey respondents, with those gains retained at the three month follow up. Respondents also identified barriers in supporting their child or young person, including lack of understanding about how to adapt information effectively to their child’s needs, lack of time, and a scarcity of workshops and resources in regional areas. Implications: The provision of sexuality workshops to build the knowledge and confidence of parents and carers is highly valuable. However, improving the sexuality support provided to children and young people should also focus on identifying and minimising barriers to providing that support.",Conference Paper,,,,0,"

A Comparative Content Analysis of Pre-Internet and Contemporary Child Sexual Abuse Material,"['Michael Salter', 'Tyson Whitten']","Child sexual abuse material is now recognised as a major social problem however, prior to the internet, disclosures of victimisation in abuse material were the subject of sceptical scholarly commentary. The veracity of the sceptical position has been subject to limited empirical scrutiny. The aim of this study is to analyse the content of a sample of 1004 images of pre-internet abuse material. The pre-internet sample was analysed according to the characteristics of victim/s, perpetrator/s and severity and setting of abuse, which were then compared to a pre-existing dataset of 34,561 contemporary abuse images. The findings of the study underscore the severity of pre-internet abuse material. The comparison between the pre-internet and contemporary sample found that the average age of girls abused in abuse material has decreased, and the severity of the material has increased. The study highlights the significant abuse experienced by abuse material victims prior to the internet, and suggests the popularisation of the internet is linked to a trend towards more serious offending against children in abuse material. The consistent role of the home as the major site of abuse material production poses significant challenges to prevention, early intervention and prosecution.",Article,1.0, Deviant Behavior,,1,"

Land rights in peacebuilding discourse: domination and resistance in Timor-Leste’s Ita Nia Rai program,"['Maxim Mancino', 'Srinjoy Bose']","The development of land rights programs is deeply rooted in power relations. Using discourse analysis, this paper unpacks how Western logics (assumptions and conventions) regarding ‘best practices’ for property rights institutions and tenure security impact the design of peacebuilding programs. In 2017, the Government of Timor-Leste passed a controversial Land Law Package. These laws were initially developed for a USAID land reform program. But local dynamics, actions, and interests were ignored. Examining civil society exclusion from decision-making infers a reluctance to acknowledge local voices and practices that threaten liberal peacebuilding interests. This paper is organised into two parts. In the first, we argue that peacebuilding ‘best practices’ reflect how dominant Western discourses create conceptual boundaries (‘violent hierarchies’) to restrict the recognition of indigenous ideas as legitimate. In the second, we examine Timorese civil society efforts to improve the land reform program through acts of resistance to bodies of authority. Overall, we illuminate how in Timor-Leste Western assumptions and conventions contributed to boundaries to local participation, which contradicts liberal narratives of empowerment and capacity-building.",Article,1.0, Australian Journal Of International Affairs,Apr 5,1,"

The evidence points to the importance of historical and contemporary experiences tied to colonisation and intergenerational trauma. For young Indigenous gender and sexuality diverse peoples, heteronormative colonial value systems converge to produce environments characterised by racism, phobia and marginalisation.

Elder Mediation Services Among Diverse Older Adult Communities in Australia: Practitioner Perspectives on Accessibility,"['Annie Herro', 'Ka Yee Lee', 'Adrienne Withall[...]', 'Craig Sinclair']","Background and objectives: Elder abuse is a complex problem, and barriers to reporting and help-seeking include shame and fear of loss of relationships with key family members. Elder-mediation has been identified as one promising method of alternative dispute resolution. This study aimed to investigate the accessibility of elder-mediation services among diverse groups of older adults, from the perspective of practitioners in a large Australian jurisdiction. Research design and methods: The study employed a sequential mixed-methods approach, comprising a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews (N=17) and an online survey of practitioners (N=49) involved in referral to, or provision of, elder-mediation services. Accessibility was conceptualized using existing theoretical frameworks, spanning practical (logistics-related) and normative (justice and culture-related) dimensions. Results: Factors limiting accessibility of elder-mediation services included lack of community and practitioner awareness of elder abuse and elder-mediation, discomfort with the mediation process, financial costs, lack of services in regional and remote areas and complex service systems for older people. Within the mediation process, difficulties in assessing and accommodating cognitive and other impairments, managing power imbalances and determining the appropriateness of the dispute for mediation were influential. Discussion and implications: This study showed that mediation can be a promising and effective approach to resolving disputes involving older people. The emergent perceptive dimension (community and practitioner awareness) emphasizes the importance of awareness raising efforts surrounding both elder abus

Outcomes of routine screening for reproductive coercion in a family planning service,"['Yan Cheng', 'Eleanor Wilson', 'Jessica R Botfield[...]', 'Kevin McGeechan']","Background: Reproductive coercion (RC) occurs when a person's autonomous decision-making regarding reproductive health is compromised by another. RC screening, that is, the use of routine, non-invasive screening questions asked of service users/clients, is one strategy that can be used to assess for RC. Routine screening for RC was implemented within Family Planning NSW clinical consultations in December 2018. A cross-sectional study was undertaken to review the outcomes of screening to better understand the situation of RC among women accessing family planning services. Methods: A retrospective review of clinical consultation data of eligible women attending Family Planning NSW clinics in 2019 was undertaken. Descriptive analysis was conducted and modified Poisson regression was used to estimate prevalence ratios and assess associations between binary outcomes and client characteristics. Results: Of 7943 women eligible for RC screening, 5497 were screened (69%) and 127 women (2.3%) disclosed RC. RC was more likely to be disclosed among clients who were unemployed, had a disability or had more than one visit within 1 year. Conclusions: Sexual and reproductive health clinicians, in particular, are well placed to conduct RC screening. However, they must have adequate training and access to resources to implement screening and respond to women who disclose RC.",Article,1.0, Sexual Health,,0,"

Characteristics and Impacts of Sexual Violence Against Men and Boys in Conflict and Displacement: A Multicountry Exploratory Study,"['Sarah Chynoweth', 'Dale Buscher', 'Sarah Martin', 'Anthony Zwi']","Evidence of sexual violence against men and boys in many conflict-affected settings is increasingly recognized. Yet relatively little is currently known about the varied forms, sites, and impacts of this violence. Further, scant research on sexual violence against men and boys in displacement contexts has been undertaken to date. To begin to address these knowledge gaps, we undertook a multicountry, qualitative, exploratory study to gain insights into these issues. Study settings and populations were Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh; refugees and migrants who had traveled through Libya residing in Italy; and refugees from eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Somalia, and South Sudan residing in Nairobi and Mombasa, Kenya. Methods included 55 semi-structured focus group discussions with 310 refugees and semi-structured key informant interviews with 148 aid workers 1 Women's Refugee Commission, 2 Journal of Interpersonal Violence and human rights experts. Data were thematically analyzed using NVivo 12. Findings suggest that sexual violence against men and boys may not be rare in Myanmar (northern Rakhine state), Libya, eastern DRC, and South Sudan. Frequently reported forms of violence in these settings were genital violence, forced witnessing of sexual violence, and rape. Sites where violence was often reported included border crossings, along the roadside, and during imprisonment. In host countries, forms of sexual violence included sexual abuse of boys, sexual exploitation particularly of adolescents and persons with diverse sexual orientation and gender identity, and rape.

Mothers & Daughters : Redefining Cultural Continuity Through South Sudanese Women’s Artistic Practices,"['Caroline Lenette', 'Apuk Maror', 'Serena Manwaring']","A group of South Sudanese women came together in 2018 to share artistic and cultural practices with one another during a series of creative workshops at a community art gallery in Sydney, Australia. We collaborated with the women to organise workshop activities and a community event to showcase their cultural artefacts and items created during the workshops. Through a research-arts partnership, we documented women’s conversations about their artistic and cultural traditions and practices during weekly gatherings and pre and post-workshop discussions. This paper suggests that the women involved in these participant-designed and driven workshops were redefining their culture and cultural practices in a different place, and shaped new notions of cultural continuity, defined as the process of maintaining and passing on traditional knowledge. They conceptualised cultural traditions as everyday practices in their lived realities, and as points of connections with the past. The creation of a women-only space for artistic practices in a resettlement context provided regular opportunities for women of different ages to discuss culturally-prescribed gender norms and traditions candidly. Participant-led research-arts collaborations represent a flexible approach to exploring women’s notions of art and culture and gender-based experiences to understand how they navigate everyday social realities.",Article,9.0, Journal of Intercultural Studies,,0,"

This article examines service responses in Australia, exploring practitioners' accounts of adapting service delivery models in the early months of the pandemic. Data from a qualitatively enriched online survey of practitioners (n = 100) show the ways services rapidly shifted to engage with clients via remote, technology-mediated modes, as physical distancing requirements triggered rapid expansion in the use of phone, email, video calls and messaging, and many face-to-face interventions temporarily ceased. Many practitioners and service managers found that remote service delivery improved accessibility and efficiency. Others expressed concerns about their capacity to assess risk without face-to-face contact, and were unsure whether new service modalities would meet the needs of all client groups and reflect best practice. Findings attest to practitioners' mixed experiences during this period of rapid service innovation and change, and underline the importance of monitoring emerging approaches to establish which service adaptations are effective for different groups of people, and to determine good practice for combining remote and face-to-face service options in the longer term.",Article,1.0, British Journal of Social Work,Jul 31,0,"

The interviews demonstrate the different ways in which social inclusion/exclusion practices, patterns and process within First Nations communities and non-Indigenous LGBTIQ+ communities impact on the SCEWB of these young people. The research demonstrates the importance of acceptance and support from families in particular the centrality of mothers to young people feeling accepted, safe and able to successfully overcome challenges to SCEWB. Non-Indigenous urban LGBTIQ+ communities are at times seen as a “second family” for young people, however, structural racism within these communities is also seen as a problem for young people’s inclusion.

Young Carers in Australia: Understanding Experiences of Caring and Support-Seeking Behaviour,"['Isaac Yeboah Addo', 'Sienna Aguilar', 'Sarah Judd-Lam[...]', 'Abner Weng Cheong Poon']","Although young carers experience several challenges associated with their roles, little is known about the current effects of those challenges on their education, work, and social life. Their support-seeking behaviour is also under-researched. Based on findings from 25 interviews and a focus group discussion, this qualitative study presents insights into the effects of providing informal care on the lives of young carers and their support-seeking behaviour. Participants reported several physical, mental, and social effects of caring that have either positive or negative implications for their lives. Whereas providing care influenced early maturity, self-efficacy, and formation of stronger bonds with care recipients, it also limited participants’ ability to find work, focus on their education, and socialise with peers. Utilisation of formal community-based and professional support services was low among the participants. Stigma associated with the label “carer”; lack of youth-friendly service settings; lack of self-identification of carer status; and a lack of cultural, age, and specific support services for different stages of caring constrained the use of support services among participants. In contrast, positive attitudes of service providers encouraged the use of support services. These findings highlight an urgent need for more professional support for young carers. • IMPLICATIONS • Failure to provide sufficient professional support to young carers can aggravate the negative consequences associated with their caring roles. • Social workers and other professionals can strengthen their collaboration with educators, work supervisors, and other support agencies to address the challenges of providing care at a young age. • Given that caring roles

Sintering expansion behavior and expansion mechanism of Cu-Ni-Al powder alloy,"['Y. Feng', 'Y.-M. Li', 'Haobin He', 'Z.-Y. Zeng']","Cu-10Ni-1.25Al alloy was prepared by compression molding with Cu, Ni and Al powder. The sintering behavior and expansion mechanism of Cu-Ni-Al system powder alloy were investigated. The results show that considerable expansion occurs after being sintered at 600-800°C, accompanied by the decrease of density and increase of porosity. The measurements including differential thermal analysis, EDAX analysis and metallographic observation were conducted, and it is proved that the compacts perform the larger and faster expansion after the appearance of Al-rich melt which forms by the reaction of Al with Cu and Ni at 600°C. Al-rich melt penetrates into the grain boundaries of Cu particles and leaves pores at the prior Al particle sites. Because of a large solubility of Al in the Cu and Ni, Al-rich melt is finally absorbed into the solid as a result of unbalanced diffusion between components, leading to the net mass flow between the solid/liquid interfaces, which brings about the solid particle grain growth and the increase in the volume of the specimen as a whole.",Article,0.0, Zhongnan Daxue Xuebao (Ziran Kexue Ban)/Journal of Central South University (Science and Technology),Apr 19,0,"

When Following the Rules Is Bad for Wellbeing: The Effects of Gendered Rules in the Australian Construction Industry,"['Natalie Galea', 'Abigail Powell', 'Fanny Salignac[...]', 'Martin Loosemore']","The construction industry is known to be highly masculinised and to have work practices detrimental to employees’ wellbeing. Drawing on feminist institutional theory and a rapid ethnographic approach in two construction multinationals in Australia, we examine the relationship between the gendered nature of construction and workplace wellbeing for professional women and men employed in the industry. The findings reveal that adhering to the gendered ‘rules in use’ in the construction industry is negatively associated with wellbeing and is usually endured in silence. We also identify the ways in which the gendered rules have different effects on the wellbeing of men and women. We conclude that the construction industry is characterised by a set of ‘greedy’ gendered institutions that are inextricably linked to workplace wellbeing for both men and women and that these rules must be broken to improve worker wellbeing.",Article,1.0, Work Employment and Society,,0,"

"Greening Sydney: attitudes, barriers and opportunities for tree planting","['Natalia Saldarriaga', 'Krishna K. Shrestha', 'Phil McManus', 'Ayusha Bajracharya']","Understanding people’s attitudes towards the urban forest is crucial to advance sustainability goals and for proposing policy changes in local governments. With global cities such as Sydney becoming highly multi-cultural, it is vital for local governments in cities to be responsive to the diverse voices and interests of their residents. This paper investigates attitudes of people from different socio-economic backgrounds and thereby identifies barriers and opportunities for tree planting. Analysing two socio-economically diverse local government areas (LGAs) in Sydney, viz. Parramatta and North Sydney, this paper demonstrates that residents’ attitudes towards trees depends largely on tree location. Trees located on private land, are preferred for aesthetics and functionality (e.g. beauty and privacy), and trees are removed if they represent a threat to residents’ health or infrastructure. Trees located on public land are appreciated because people prefer to live along a tree-lined street where aesthetic and environmental values of trees are paramount. The above attitudes vary with income, education and dwelling type. Findings from this study suggest that local governments must engage effectively with socio-economically diverse populations and recognise different attitudes of communities in policies and practices for managing urban greenery.",Article,0.0, Australian Geographer,,0,"

"Impact and Return on Investment of the Take Kare Safe Space Program—A Harm Reduction Strategy Implemented in Sydney, Australia","['Christopher M. Doran', 'Phillip Wadds', 'Anthony Shakeshaft', 'Dam Anh Tran']","Safe spaces are increasingly utilized to reduce alcohol-related harm, violence, crime and improve public safety in nightlife settings. This study aimed to determine the impact and return on investment of the Take Kare Safe Space (TKSS) program—a harm reduction program implemented to address alcohol-related violence and disorder in three locations in Sydney’s night-time economy between 2014 and 2019. TKSS ambassadors provided support at static safe spaces and patrolled designated nightlife precincts to provide practical assistance to vulnerable and intoxicated people. Ambassadors recorded information relating to these interactions including ‘client’ age, gender, perceived level of intoxication, time and length of engagement with the program. Costs of program implementation and benefits of major incidents averted were obtained to allow calculation of return on investment. From December 2014 to April 2019, 66,455 people were supported by TKSS ambassadors. Most users were male (62%) and aged 18–25 years (66%). Of 3633 interventions by ambassadors, serious risk of harm was averted in 735 cases (20%). The program’s return on investment is estimated at 2.67, suggesting that a $1 investment results in $2.67 in benefits. Safe Spaces are extensively utilized, particularly by young males with high levels of intoxication, and represent a positive return on investment. Despite the growth of such services, there remains a notable absence of rigorous, independent evaluation regarding the outcomes and/or social benefit of safe space programs. From a policy perspective, there is a need for more high-quality economic evaluations to better inform decisions about competing uses of limited resources.",Article,1.0, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,0,"

SELF-REPRESENTATION IN PARTICIPATORY VIDEO RESEARCH: ETHICS AND LESSONS LEARNT,"['Caroline Lenette', 'Isobel Blomfield', 'Arash Bordbar[...]', 'Anyier Yuol']","Participatory video involves co-researchers using digital or video cameras to create their own videos and present issues according to their sense of what is important. In 2018, the authors—including three co-researchers from refugee backgrounds—collaborated through participatory video research to document views on better access and participation in higher education. Here, we reflect on key ethical issues encountered and share lessons learnt from our project. Our aim is not to discredit this methodology but to contribute new discussions on how participatory video can be used effectively as a form of self-representation to target wide audiences and effect social and policy change. This way, debates on the social and political potentialities of arts-based methods such as participatory video can be expanded. Since deploying participatory video in forced migration research is a relatively novel approach, there is much scope to expand the contours of knowledge on its potential to reach diverse audiences and open up new opportunities for social and political impact.",Article,0.0, Art/Research International A Transdisciplinary Journal,,0,"

Women and new labour: Engendering politics and policy?,"['Claire Annesley', 'F. Gains', 'Kirstein Rummery']","Although there is a growing body of international literature on the feminisation of politics and the policy process and, as New Labour’s term of office progresses, a rapidly growing series of texts around New Labour’s politics and policies, until now no one text has conducted an analysis of New Labour’s politics and policies from a gendered perspective, despite the fact that New Labour have set themselves up to specifically address women’s issues and attract women voters. This book fills that gap in an interesting and timely way. Women and New Labour will be a valuable addition to both feminist and mainstream scholarship in the social sciences, particularly in political science, social policy and economics. Instead of focusing on traditionally feminist areas of politics and policy (such as violent crime against women) the authors opt to focus on three case study areas of mainstream policy (economic policy, foreign policy and welfare policy) from a gendered perspective. The analytical framework provided by the editors yields generalisable insights that will outlast New Labour’s third term.",Book,,,,0,"

Importance of sex education for a successful post-school transition: Experiences of high school girls with intellectual disability,"['Iva Strnadová', 'Julie Loblinzk', 'Joanne Danker']","Background. Students with intellectual disability often do not receive holistic sex education, which is critical for their successful transition to post-school life, including having an ability to make healthy choices about their sexuality and relationships. The aim of this inclusive research study was to explore the perceptions and experiences of sex education with Australian high school girls with intellectual disability, as they prepare for a transition to post-school life. Method. There were 11 high school girls aged 13 – 20 years who participated in this study. The interviews were analysed using inductive content analysis. Findings. The findings indicate that critical topics such as gender and sexual identity, and masturbation are not sufficiently covered in sex education in New South Wales, Australia. The participating girls also highlighted ways in which teachers could make sex education lessons more accessible. Individual Learning Plan meetings, an important platform for transition planning, were attended by less than a third of the girls in this study. Conclusions. Comprehensive and accessible programs on sex education for high school girls with intellectual disability are needed to promote successful transition to an autonomous life for these students.",Article,1.0, British Journal of Learning Disabilities,,0,"

This review aimed to identify and analyze existing family interventions that addressed the physical health of carers. Methods A scoping review was conducted to identify peer-reviewed journal articles on family interventions with physical health components. A total of six articles were found and analyzed thematically to identify the family interventions, physical health components of the interventions, and associated physical health outcomes. Results Synthesis of the findings from relevant articles showed that the development of physical health components in family interventions is emerging and at an early stage. However, most studies had physical health as a minor area focusing mainly on stress and sleep.

‘Better than a pill’: digital storytelling as a narrative process for refugee women,"['Caroline Lenette', 'Mark Brough', 'Robert Schweitzer[...]', 'Lyn Vromans']","Digital storytelling is a valuable and ethical research tool to engage in collaborative research with refugee women. This paper recounts how digital storytelling was used in a mixed-methods study on settlement, to document the journeys of women who entered Australia through the Woman at Risk program in 2014–2015. Instead of merely asking a series of questions, the digital storytelling process extended our qualitative inquiry as an approach that valued the women’s own memories, interests, and hopes. The methodology represents a meaningful way of engaging in collaborative research, where participating women were not just storytellers but valued as active co-constructors of new knowledge. We outline each of three digital narratives as a ‘whole’ to consider what we can learn from a storytelling process where women with complex circumstances are privileged as protagonists-and-producers of their own stories. We argue that it is worth critically reflecting on the concepts the women propose for themselves as meaningful ways to articulate their lives, when we relinquish the researcher role as question asker to enter a space alongside participants and listen intently. Our paper highlights the broader potential of digital storytelling particularly in mental health research in collaboration with refugee participants.",Article,8.0, Media Practice and Education,,1,"

Artistic Representations of Refugees: What Is the Role of the Artist?,"['Isobel Blomfield', 'Caroline Lenette']","The literature on ethical considerations for artists involved in collaborative projects with refugees and asylum seekers is sparse, indicating a lack of robust discussions on the ethical pitfalls artists may encounter in such endeavours. Based on the first author’s reflections on her subjective experiences as an artist representing the story of a young Somali asylum seeker woman through collaborative filmmaking, this paper aims to open up broader discussions about artists’ responsibilities to produce counter-narratives that value refugees’ perspectives and voices. By doing so, artists can avoid perpetuating existing tropes that can at times be detrimental to refugees and asylum seekers, and ensure that artists’ own agendas are secondary to what ‘protagonists’ wish to convey. We suggest five simple ways of realising this goal: genuine collaboration; informed consent; anonymity; focusing on the mundane; and (in the case of filmmaking specifically) an awareness of the editing process as a political act.",Article,8.0, Journal of Intercultural Studies,Jun 25,1,"

Gendered Responses to Gendered Harms: Sexual Violence and Bystander Intervention at Australian Music Festivals,"['Greta Baillie', 'Bianca Fileborn', 'Phillip Wadds']","Bystander intervention has shown promise in preventing sexual violence in certain social contexts. Despite emerging evidence of pervasive sexual violence at music festivals, no research has considered bystander intervention in this setting. Drawing on an online survey conducted with 371 Australian festival attendees, we explore the role of gender on bystander intervention at music festivals. Findings point to significant gender differences, with women more willing and likely to intervene in a broader range of scenarios. We argue that responses to sexual violence are a collective responsibility shared by both women and men, as well as festival organizers and industry bodies.",Article,1.0, Violence Against Women,,0,"

As a consequence, during the last decade, social media has increased in popularity. Currently, 3.96 billion people use different social networking platforms, which became double in 2021, which was 2.07 billion in 2015 [1]. Therefore, the ease of using these virtual media for social communication provisionally appeared extremely useful. However, sociologists believe that virtual social interaction has ushered in a dark era or that one is on the horizon[2].

Rates of homicide and homicide associated with severe mental illness in NSW between 1993 and 2016,"['Olav Nielssen', 'Georgia Lyons', 'Katya Oldfield[...]', 'Matthew Large']","Objective To describe the characteristics of offenders found not guilty on the grounds of mental illness (NGMI) in New South Wales and rates of NGMI and other homicide verdicts. Method Demographic, legal and clinical data after referral to the NSW Mental Health Review Tribunal following an NGMI verdict for homicide matched with results from the National Homicide Monitoring Program. Results Between 1993 and 2016, a total of 2159 homicide offenders were dealt with by the NSW courts, including 169 (7.8%) who were found NGMI. Over this period, the rate of non-NGMI homicide convictions fell from 1.83 per 100,000 per annum to 0.65 per 100,000 per annum (Kendall’s tau = −0.79, p ⩽ 0.001) while the rate of NGMI homicide fluctuated, with an average annual rate of about 0.1 per 100,000 per annum (Kendall’s tau = 0.17, p = 0.23). There was no association between the annual rates of NGMI and non-NGMI homicides (Pearson r = −0.3, p = 0.16) but falling rate of non-NGMI homicide meant that the proportion of NGMI offences doubled from 5.5% in the first 12 years to 11% in the second 12 years. Nearly all (88.7%) of those found NGMI had a schizophrenia-related psychosis. However, there were high rates of psychiatric comorbidity including substance use disorder (60.7%) and a history of a prior head injury (41.1%). Most (83.4%) of the NGMI offenders had previous contact with mental health services, but only half of these had received treatment with antipsychotic medication. Conclusion The fall in conviction for homicide offences in the last 24 years has not been matched by a reduction in NGMI homicide verdicts.

Regulation of nursing professionals in Cambodia: strategies to overcome underpinning challenges,"['Sadatoshi Matsuoka', 'Noriko Fujita', 'Kyoko Koto-Shimada', 'Anthony Zwi']","Aims To elucidate (i) the challenges and constraints in the development and implementation of the regulatory framework for nursing professionals in Cambodia and (ii) the specific strategies adopted to address the challenges experienced in Cambodia. Introduction The health workforce will be critical to achieving the health‐related and wider Sustainable Development Goals in the years up to 2030. Background In 2006, the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations signed a Mutual Recognition Arrangement in relation to nursing services in the region with the main aim of facilitating the mobility of nursing professionals between countries. To ensure the competency of the health workforce and the quality and safety of health services, member states are required to establish an appropriate regulatory framework. Methods This is a qualitative descriptive study. Eighteen key informant interviews were conducted in Cambodia in 2018. Walt and Gilson’s policy analysis model was applied to organize and synthesize the data. Findings Major challenges were identified such as conceptual and cultural issues, limited capacity of Cambodian stakeholders and an unstandardized system with limited coordination. Discussion In Cambodia, the nursing regulatory environment has expanded greatly over the last decade. Strategies adopted were ‘political leadership’, optimal utilization of ‘outsider’s capacity’, strengthening ‘insider’s capacity’, and ‘dedicated consultation and collaboration and consensus building’ involving all players. Implications for nursing and health policies Policymakers in similar resource‐limited countries could apply and adapt similar strategic efforts when formulating and implementing health policies, legislation and regul

Shrinking room for hedging: system-unit dynamics and behavior of smaller powers,['Alexander Korolev'],"This article advances the understanding of ‘hedging’ in international politics by highlighting and examining the limits to smaller powers’ hedging behavior. Building on the line of reasoning that hedging is an outcome of regional or state-level, rather than system-level, variables, the article suggests that the room for hedging available to smaller states shrinks as great powers become more competitive and attempt to balance against one another. With an empirical focus on the post-Cold War South China Sea region, particularly the evolving behavior of the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia, the article demonstrates how, under the conditions of growing China–US competition, these regional states start moving from hedging to more pronounced bandwagoning vis-à-vis great powers regardless their domestic-level sociopolitical dispositions. Therefore, hedging has limits and can be envisaged as a ‘luxury’ that is inversely related to the intensity of great power balancing.",Article,9.0, International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,,0,"

The female condom: What do Australian women say?,"['Jessica R Botfield', 'Sarah Cucuzza', 'Prudence Kidman[...]', 'Deborah Bateson']","Background The female condom is a barrier method for prevention of sexually transmissible infections and unintended pregnancy. Uptake of this method remains low in Australia, although little research has been undertaken to explore this. Methods An interventional cross‐sectional study was undertaken in 2019 to explore the views and experiences of women in New South Wales. After trying the female condom, they were invited to complete an online survey and/or structured interview. Training in use of the female condom was not provided. This paper reports on qualitative findings from open‐ended survey responses and interviews. Results In total 284 participants completed the survey, and 20 participated in an interview. Most were aware of the female condom prior to participating in the study, but few had used it previously. Four broad themes were identified from the data: i) accessibility of the female condom, including cost and availability, ii) supporting choice in different circumstances, iii) aspects of empowerment and control, and iv) use of gendered language. Conclusions The female condom may be an acceptable option for many women in Australia. To support choice of method and promote uptake, it will be important to increase accessibility of the female condom by raising awareness and addressing issues of cost and availability. Further exploration of issues regarding inclusive language and messaging in health promotion campaigns and marketing is warranted to ensure this product is accessible for all people who may wish to use it, regardless of gender or sexuality. Similar research could be undertaken with men/partners and members of the LGBTQ+ community to explore their perspectives of the female condom.

Driverless Autonomous Taxi Service: A futuristic open-source conceptual back-end architecture and technical operation strategies,['Md Badiuzzaman'],"Driverless taxi service is no longer a novel idea as few ventures have been testing the human-less/driverless taxi service—Google's parent company Alphabet testing autonomous taxi service in Phoenix, Arizona. A government and industry supported autonomous car service ""DRIVEN"" has been initiated in London since 2019. Another e-commerce giant, ""Alibaba"" formed a new firm, ""AutoX,"" and tested autonomous taxi services in some Shanghai city parts in China. Not only tech giants but even prominent universities are also taking part in the exciting race of human-less taxi service. An MIT based engineer brought a driverless taxi service to Singapore. Therefore, many tech giant companies and lead research universities are accelerating their pace to win the driverless taxi business's race at the background level. However, it seems the existing market dominators are ahead in the race, and as usual, they are going to grab the future driverless taxi service business. The article aims to propose a conceptual back-end operational architecture to construct a driverless taxi service. The development of driverless cars seems satisfactory, and already almost-driverless cars are available in the market (2020 Tesla Model S, 2020 Cadillac CT6, 2020 Nissan Rogue, 2020 BMW X7, 2020 Infiniti QX50, 2020 Volvo XC60, 2020 Mercedes-Benz S-Class). Therefore, an individual entrepreneur will organize his own driverless car taxi service using an operational strategy in the near future.

Mapping Activist Responses and Policy Advocacy for Street Harassment: Current Practice and Future Directions,['Bianca Fileborn'],"This article presents findings from a comprehensive mapping exercise of activist responses to, and policy advocacy for, street harassment across the US, UK and Australia. Analysis of activist groups found that the bulk of responses constituted forms of “awareness raising” and documenting the experiences of victims, suggesting that current advocacy is largely situated within the “problem identification” phase of policy development. The extent and focus of activism and advocacy efforts varied across the three locations, with the responses advocated for shaped by local concerns and politics. In particular, activist groups diverged in their support for criminal justice responses to street harassment. Where policy and other initiatives have been developed, these have rarely been evaluated, and there is a clear need to establish an evidence base to better support future policy and practice developments.",Article,,,Mar 1,0,"

Planning for Health Sector Reform in Post-Conflict Situations: Kosovo 1999-2000,"['Dean A Shuey', 'Fatime Arenliu Qosaj', 'Erik Schouten', 'Anthony Zwi']","The restoration and development of health care systems in post-conflict situations and complex emergencies are attracting attention. Kosovo is unique in being a post-conflict situation, in a former socialist country, with an unclear political future, under temporary UN administration. The World Health Organization (WHO) led a process of developing a health policy framework for the emergency period that included elements of health sector reform, a somewhat controversial initiative. Reform elements of the policy were consistent with normative health policies in much of eastern and central Europe. There was tension between the need to have a policy in place rapidly and the desire to be participatory. Policy to deal with emergency situations that is not available at the time required is of limited value. Although there was some tension between relief and development agendas, the policy process did direct significant resources and effort in directions that contributed to longer-term reform and development. A policy framework does not ensure compliance with policy unless issues of authority, mandate, and leadership are clear. A rapidly developed health policy framework at the onset of an emergency is desirable. Policy developers should be experienced, seen as being neutral and be relatively independent of any specific donor or interest group. WHO is well situated to play this role if it meets certain conditions.",Article,3.0, Health Policy,,0,"

PWE-103 Positive nutritional outcomes in patients receiving home parenteral nutrition (hpn) with palliative malignancy: a uk single centre series,"['Rebecca Whitefield', 'R Iriarte', 'H Bridgestock[...]', 'NE Burch']","Introduction HPN use in those with malignant bowel obstruction or palliative cancer is relatively commonplace. The 2009 ESPEN guidelines advise consideration if tumour related prognosis is 2–3 months, where TPN is expected to improve or stabilise performance status and/or quality of life. To review our practice we undertook a retrospective audit of all palliative HPN discharges over 4 years. Method Retrospective audit of all palliative HPN discharges between October 2012 and November 2016 from UHCW. Data collected included: diagnosis, demographics, nutritional and biochemical parameters, estimated prognosis, complications, and outcome. Outcomes were collected up to 31st January 2017. Results 17 patients were identified; age 36–79 (mean 57); 59% female. Diagnosis included: malignant GI tract obstruction (n=12; 70%); malignant enterocutaneous fistulae (n=2; 12%); and malabsorption/autonomic dysfunction (n=3; 18%). Estimated prognosis was documented in 11/17 (65%):>3 months in 4 (36%); 3–6 months in 2 (18%);>6 months in 3 (27%), and >12 months in 2 (18%). 9/17 (53%) received chemotherapy alongside TPN. Weight at start of PN was 46.4–94.5 kg (mean 63.7); BMI 16.3–34.6 (mean 21.8); weight loss 0%–32% (mean 12.5%) prior to referral. 7/17 (42%) patients were alive at analysis. Of these, 3/17 (18%) had discontinued HPN due to resolution of intestinal failure, and 4/17 (24%) continuned HPN. Duration of HPN was 6.5–21 months (mean 13.4) in those with resolution, and 13.3–18 months (mean 15) in those continuing HPN. The remaining 10 patients (59%) had died; duration of HPN in this group was 0.3–29.1 months (mean 6.5). 12/17 patients (71%) survived longer than their estimated prognosis

The beef with vegans: Managing stigma in Britain's hegemonic meat culture,['Hannah Howard'],"As one of the fastest growing lifestyle choices, veganism is a diet, lifestyle and social movement motivated by animal rights, environmental protection and human health. Veganism is considered socially deviant from the hegemonic meat culture of the UK and so vegans often receive stigma when expressing this element of their identity. This study aimed to critically examine how vegans manage stigma dependent on the social and spatial context. Semi-structured interviews with 20 vegans in northwest England revealed that vegans employ four main strategies to manage stigma: acceptance, avoidance, reduction and denial. The chosen management technique was determined by a stigmatised individual's acceptance or rejection of public understandings of the stigma and the applicability of the stigma to the self. Social and spatial context were often emphasised by participants, with many vegans communicating a need to adapt their management techniques in accordance with the situation-often employing elements of different strategies simultaneously. The study thus highlights the idea of stigma as a social construct that is shifting and wide-ranging.",Article,,,,0,"

Gender-based Violence in Sport: Prevalence and Problems,"['Melanie Lang', 'Lut Mergaert', 'Tine Vertommen', 'Catarina Arnaut']","Little is known about the prevalence of gender-based violence (GBV) in sport in European Union (EU) Member States (MS). The research question underpinning this study was therefore: What is the nature and extent of gender-based violence in sport in the EU? The study involved a scoping exercise that mapped existing research on the incidence and/or prevalence of any/all form(s) of GBV in sport. This was complemented by interviews with key stakeholders within each EU MS. Forty-one studies were identified across 17 countries. Of these, none investigated the whole range of behaviours that constitute GBV, so the prevalence of GBV in sport in EU MS is unknown. The most commonly studied form of GBV was sexual harassment, which had a reported prevalence rate of between 1% and 64% due to different methodologies and definitions. This variation is indicative of the challenges of studying GBV, which are discussed in this paper. Without clear prevalence rates for of (all forms of) GBV, prevention efforts cannot be efficiently targeted and the effectiveness of interventions cannot be assessed. Among others, we recommend the European Commission contract regular research in sport that uses a standardized definition of GBV and a common methodological approach.",Article,1.0, European Journal for Sport and Society,Nov 10,0,"

Depression in adolescent obesity: Cultural moderators of the association between obesity and depressive symptoms,"['J Wardle', 'S Williamson', 'Fiona Johnson', 'C Edwards']","Community studies relating depression to obesity in adolescents have generated inconsistent results. It has been argued that the variability in findings is due to effect modification by demographic characteristics that vary across samples. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the strength of the obesity-depression association is moderated by gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES). Data were from two large, school-based, studies of adolescent health and well-being (n=4320; n=1824). Students completed one of two measures of depressive symptoms (SDQ; CES-D) in school and were weighed and measured. Gender and ethnicity were self-reported and SES was indexed by residential neighbourhood characteristics or individual family deprivation. There was barely any association between obesity and depressive symptoms in either sample. There was also no evidence that obese participants who were female, white or from higher SES backgrounds were especially vulnerable to depressive symptoms. The results indicate that in community samples of adolescents, regardless of gender, SES or ethnicity, reports of depressive symptoms are not significantly higher in obese than normal-weight groups. The results are discussed in terms of obese adolescents' resilience in the face of multiple social adversities.",Article,6.0, International Journal of Obesity,,0,"

Child-centred Framing Through Design Research: A Framework For Analysing Children’s ‘Dream Wheelchair’ Designs to Elicit Meaning and Elevate Their Voice,"['Cara Shaw', 'Francesca Bernardi', 'Farnaz Nickpour']","PREPRINT: This paper considers the possibilities of analysing children’s own designs to contribute to inclusive paediatric mobility design. The aim of this paper is threefold: (1) to develop a framework for child-centred design analysis, (2) to analyse children’s designs to explore both quantitative and qualitative insights and (3) to explore how children’s voice could be elevated through design research. A Child-centred Design Analysis Framework is developed in an interdisciplinary manner, comprising four dimensions including Child, Content, Context and Format. It is used as a vehicle to analyse and code 130 ‘Dream Wheelchair’ designs by children. The children’s ‘Dream Wheelchair’ designs reference a range of features and priorities, which are gathered into themes through the framework, providing insights into children’s individual and collective mobility narratives, values and requirements. Themes are explored through a qualitative interdisciplinary lens to understand the nature of children’s lived experiences. The framework promotes child-centred framing through extracting meaning from children’s own designs. It is suggested that child-centred framing and a rights-respecting approach to assistive technology design research can lead to more appropriate design outcomes and improved user experiences for children with disabilities.",Article,,,Aug 4,1,"

Hallmarks of the Political in Community Organizing: An Arendtian Perspective,['Paul Bunyan'],"Drawing upon Hannah Arendt’s adherence to existential phenomenology, the article advances a political understanding and interpretation of community organizing. Arendt, it is maintained, offers valuable insight into political phenomena which are constitutive of community organizing. Four aspects, in particular, are highlighted—what I refer to as the four “A”s of association, action, appearance and authenticity—understood in existentialist, phenomenological, ontological and ultimately political terms, as primary ways of being-together-politically . The first part of the article examines Arendt’s existential phenomenological approach in shaping her understanding of the political. This provides the theoretical basis for examining in the second part of the article, phenomena which are constitutive of community organizing, highlighting how association, action, appearance and authenticity form distinctive political characteristics of community organizing as an approach. At different points, brief reference is made to the work of London Citizens, the largest broad-based organization in the UK, in order to illustrate the connections between Arendtian thought and community-based organizing.",Article,1.0, International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations,,0,"

Psychosocial aspects of weight control and weight concern in adolescent girls,['Fiona Johnson'],"The increasing prevalence of obesity has been described as a 'global epidemic' (WHO 2000), leading to calls for individuals to make changes to their dietary behaviours and physical activity levels. As the same time there is concern about the harmful effects of excessive weight concerns and dietary restriction, particularly amongst young women. Many girls who control their weight experience high levels of psychological distress and a small number go on to develop eating disorders. This thesis uses data from a survey of 1177 adolescent girls, which incorporates a one- year follow-up of the sample, to examine social and psychological factors which predispose individuals to weight control attempts. It aims to distinguish aspects of weight control associated with harmful levels of distress from those which lead to healthy lifestyle changes, examining the contribution of intensity of dieting, involvement in specific weight control practices, dietary restraint and body dissatisfaction in order to investigate which are the most harmful aspects of weight control. Weight control and dietary restraint has been associated with a number of detrimental psychological and behavioural outcomes, including depression, low self esteem and bulimic binge eating. Results presented here, however, suggest that these outcomes may be more closely associated with the high levels of body dissatisfaction found in dieters, and that the direct effects of weight control behaviours may not be as strong as has been claimed. They also suggest that the sub-group of dieters who practice only healthy, recommended methods of weight control do not exhibit many of the negative psychological and behavioural characteristics of dieters.

This article looks at the causes of arrests in children, the likely outcomes, and the ways in which this can be improved. In-hospital cardiac arrest has improving outcomes, while out-of-hospital arrest outcome remains poor and most recent research supports the vital importance of quality of CPR and measures to ensure favourable outcomes. Extracorporeal resuscitation is an emerging modality for in-hospital cardiac arrest and has increasing literature to support its use in specific circumstances as well as the impact of shorter time to initiation on quality outcomes.

Self-management programmes for adult patients with bronchiectasis: a systematic review and realist synthesis,"['Anthony Tsang', 'Dave Andrew Lynes', 'Hayley McKenzie[...]', 'Carol Kelly']","Purpose Self-management for patients with bronchiectasis has been identified as an important component that could potentially empower patients to manage their condition and improve their quality of life. Evidence was reviewed to investigate what self-management programmes work, why and in what circumstances. Methods A systematic review and realist synthesis were conducted. A comprehensive database search was performed on seven databases for evidence published up to July 2021. Leading candidate self-management programmes identified from the systematic review became the focus of the realist synthesis. A realist logic of analysis was applied to produce explanatory context-mechanism-outcome configurations. These explanations were consolidated into programme theories drawing on health behaviour change theory. Results By synthesising the data from eight eligible articles, programme theories articulated how three different self-management programmes work that included: (i) education and action planning, (ii) education and airway clearance techniques (ACT) and, (iii) education, exercise and ACT. Patient characteristics and collaborative partnership between healthcare professionals and patients were identified as important contexts that influenced the improvement in self-efficacy, health-related quality of life, and exercise capacity. Conclusions This review contributes to a better understanding of how the complex interaction between contexts and mechanisms can improve outcomes of clinical interest. • IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION • This evidence synthesis has identified potentially important combinations of interventions to be considered in self-management prog

Functional outcome of early weight bearing for acute Achilles tendon rupture treated conservatively in a weight-bearing orthosis,"['Rajib Naskar', 'L. Oliver', 'Patricia Velazquez-Ruta[...]', 'C. Southgate']","Background The optimal management for Achilles tendon (AT) ruptures is controversial and still continues to encourage debate. Conventionally, operative repair was favoured secondary to its lower rates of re-rupture, however in more recent years, we have seen promising results and a reduction in complications with conservative management. One reason for this improvement may be due to the introduction of a functional weight-bearing orthosis, however, results for complete AT ruptures is still unclear. This study aims to evaluate the functional outcomes of early weight bearing in a functional orthosis for conservatively managed, complete AT ruptures. Methodology This study was done at East Kent Hospital University Foundation Trust in between 2019−2020. In this prospective study, we have analysed data from 41 patients with US diagnosed compete AT ruptures, with gap less than 5 cm. Every patient was treated in a functional weight-bearing orthosis (VACOped) for 8 weeks with early weight-bearing following a specific treatment protocol, followed by rehabilitation with a trained physiotherapist. All patients received a final follow-up at 1 year post injury, where we recorded the following functional outcome measurements on each leg: calf girth, single leg heel raise height, single leg heel raise repetitions and the ATRS score. Result Our study population was predominantly male with an average age of 50 (range 22−79). The majority of the cohort were physically active, with more than 75% involved in a form of sporting activity pre-injury and 15% involved in higher level activity and competitive sport. The mean ATRS score was 82.1, with a re-rupture rate of only 2%. The average calf bulk difference was 1.6 cm, average heel raise height dif

State violence and the colonial roots of collusion in Northern Ireland,['Mark Mcgovern'],"This article considers the nature of collusion between the British state and loyalist paramilitary organisations during the conflict in Northern Ireland in the context of British counterinsurgency theory and practices in prior colonial campaigns. It briefly outlines the nature, pattern and logic of collusion in Northern Ireland before examining some of the key works of British counterinsurgency theorists – Charles Callwell, Charles Gwynn and Frank Kitson – reflecting on earlier imperial experiences. Collusion is understood as an expedient coercive state practice, premised on a ‘doctrine of necessity’, designed to remove ‘enemies’ and induce fear in a target population via a strategy of assassination in which the appearance of adherence to the rule of law is a political end shaping the specific forms of state violence involved. Such a practice, the author argues, is not an aberration in the tradition of British state counterinsurgency violence, it is exemplary.",Article,5.0, Race & Class,Jun 3,0,"

Navigating the shifting sands of filtering facepiece respirator provision during the COVID-19 pandemic: A system response for maximising staff safety,"['Ca Allison', 'Mike Tennant', 'Peter Xiang[...]', 'Niall Wilton']","Introduction Personal protective equipment is essential to protect health workers and patients and to ensure confidence when dealing with aerosolised disease transmission. We describe the process for ensuring adequate filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) qualitative fit testing at a local level during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Cascaded training is described, which allowed rapid spreading of the testing process, with supervision allowing quality assurance throughout. Testing consisted of subjective ‘fit checking’, checking for leaks, followed by qualitative hood testing. Results The original respirators (3M 1870) had a hood test pass rate of 87.5%. Following identification of this as a non-renewable and unsustainable option, a domestically manufactured and sustainable Help-It P2 duckbill-type respirator was adopted as the primary FFR. The hood test pass rate for this respirator was only 54%. A third respirator was made available (3M 1860), with a high pass rate of 80% but also a limited and non-renewable resource. Algorithms were constructed highlighting different proportional use of the respirators depending on the most limited resource. Conclusion The testing format used is simple, reproducible and can be used by any hospital organisation when occupational health and safety departments are unable to provide the service during overwhelming demand. Qualitative fit testing is a scalable and effective method for ensuring appropriately sized and shaped FFRs, minimising resource consumption in the process. The use of a product with appropriate filtration capacity but a lower fit test pass rate (domestic duckbill respirator) as a replaceable resource facilitated adequate respirator availability for staff that would ot

Setting 193 Australian general practices in Western Australia and New South Wales participating in the MedicineInsight programme run by NPS MedicineWise. Participants 22 791 patients aged 18 and above with T2DM. Interventions Regularity was assessed based on variation in the number of days between GP visits, with more regular contacts assumed to indicate planned, proactive care. Informational continuity (claims for care planning incentives) and relational continuity (usual provider of care index) were assessed separately. Outcome measures Process of care indicators were glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) test underuse (8 months without test), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) underuse (14 months) and HbA1c overuse (two tests within 80 days). The clinical indicator was T2DM control (HbA1c 6.5% (47.5 mmol/mol)–7.5% (58.5 mmol/mol)). Results The quintile with most regular contact had reduced odds of HbA1c and eGFR underuse (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.81 and OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.86, respectively), but increased odds of HbA1c overuse (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.38).

Overall, 3 studies have demonstrated that the 10TT can support individuals to lose weight when delivered in a leaflet format. Delivery of 10TT via new technology such as a mobile app could potentially improve its effectiveness and make it more convenient, appealing, and wide reaching. Objective: This study aimed to provide preliminary indications of the usage, effectiveness, and acceptability of an Android app of the 10TT intervention (Top Tips only app) and a second version including self-regulatory strategies for dealing with tempting foods (Top Tips plus app). Methods: The 3-month pilot randomized adults with overweight or obesity to (1) Top Tips only app, (2) Top Tips plus app, or (3) waiting list condition. Automated data from app users were collected. Validated questionnaires assessed self-regulatory skills, weight loss (kg), and behaviors at baseline and 3 months. Users’ feedback on their experience using the app was assessed using open questions. Results: A total of 81 participants took part in the pilot; 28 participants were randomized to the Top Tips only app, 27 to the Top Tips plus app, and 26 to the waiting list condition. On average, participants viewed a mean of 43.4 (SD 66.9) screens during a mean of 24.5 (SD 44.07) log-ins and used the app for 124.2 (SD 240.2) min over the 3-month period.

Effectiveness of Telehealth in Rural and Remote Emergency Departments: A Systematic Review (Preprint),"['Christina Tsou', 'Suzanne Robinson', 'James H Boyd[...]', 'Delia Hendrie']","BACKGROUND Emergency telehealth has been used to improve rural and remote patients’ access to specialist care in the hope of mitigating the significant health disparities experienced by people living in these locations. Patient disposition decisions in rural and remote emergency departments (ED) can be complex and largely dependent on the expertise and experience available to local (receiving-end) hospitals. Whilst there has been some synthesis of evidence on the effectiveness of emergency telehealth on clinical practice in the rural and remote EDs for non-acute presentations, there has been limited evaluation of the influence of contextual factors such as clinical areas and acuity of presentations on these findings. OBJECTIVE This systematic review examined the outcome measures used in studying the effectiveness of rural and remote emergency telehealth and analyzed the clinical context in which these outcome measures were used and interpreted. METHODS The search strategy used medical subject headings (MeSH) and equivalent lists of subject descriptors to find articles covering four key domains: telehealth/telemedicine, emergency department(s), effectiveness, rural and remote. According to the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome(s) of interest, and Study design (PICOS) framework, studies were selected. This search strategy was applied to MEDLINE (Ovid), Cochrane Library, Scopus, CINAHL, ProQuest, EconLit, and the CRD databases (e.g. NHS Economic Evaluation Database) for the search period of 1st January 1990 to 23rd May 2020.

"Variety, Palatability, and Obesity","['Fiona Johnson', 'Jane Wardle']","Among the key characteristics of the Western obesogenic food environment is a highly palatable and varied food supply. Laboratory investigations of eating behavior in both humans and animals established key roles for palatability and variety in stimulating appetite, delaying satiety, and promoting excessive energy intake. There is a robust effect of food palatability and variety on short-term food intake, and increased variety and palatability also cause weight gain in animal models. However, laboratory paradigms do not replicate the complexities of eating in a natural setting, and there is a shortage of evidence to estimate the magnitude of effects on weight in humans. There are substantial individual differences in susceptibility to the palatability effect and this may be a key determinant in individual vulnerability to weight gain. The understanding of pathways through which palatability and variety can affect eating is advancing, and epidemiologic and intervention studies are needed to translate laboratory findings into applications in public health or clinical domains, and to establish whether there is a role for greater regulation of the food environment in tackling increases in obesity.",Literature Review,,,,0,"

We aim to quantify the impact of this outbreak on shoulder and elbow trauma in our institution. Methods We prospectively collected data on patients presenting to our hospital with shoulder and elbow injuries during COVID-19. This included the number of attendances to the emergency department, fracture clinic, inpatient admissions and operative treatments. This was compared to a pre-COVID-19 period. We also assessed the efficacy of telephone clinics. Results There has been a noticeable decrease in the number of emergency department and fracture clinic attendances with upper limb complaints. The number of in-person fracture clinic reviews also decreased, with a reciprocal exponential increase in telephone consultations. We recorded a decrease in the number of shoulder and elbow trauma procedures performed. There was a small increase in the proportion of injuries treated conservatively during COVID-19. Our telephone clinics yielded a diagnosis and management plan in many cases and patient perspective appeared favourable. Conclusion We have noted significant change in the upper limb caseload. Certain injuries have reduced, likely due to COVID-19 lockdown.

What Can Be Learnt From 130 Children's Dream Wheelchair Designs? Eliciting Child-centred Insights Using An Interdisciplinary Design Analysis Framework,"['Cara Shaw', 'Farnaz Nickpour', 'Francesca Bernardi']","The design of inclusive paediatric mobility (IPM) interventions, such as children's wheelchairs, are entangled with technological, health and social considerations. As narratives around childhood, disability and mobility shift and transform, these entanglements evolve. In order to optimise the experience of childhood mobility, IPM designers must understand and respond to such changes and channel children's own requirements, desires and 'dreams' into the design process; this can be achieved by utilising a child-centred design approach. This paper identifies meaningful child-centred IPM design insights and opportunities through the interdisciplinary analysis of 130 dream wheelchair designs by disabled children, aged 4 to 17 years. A novel interdisciplinary and child-centred design analysis framework is developed to dissect, categorise and code the topics and features expressed through visuals and written descriptions in each of the children's dream wheelchair designs. Children's mobility narratives, desires and requirements are elicited and trending topics are discussed. It is proposed that valuing children's voices in the IPM design process could alter both the process of designing IPM interventions as well as the product outcomes.",Article,,,Aug 16,0,"

Arts therapies, particularly Dance Movement Psychotherapy, may offer additional therapeutic mechanisms for depression. Therefore, client-reported helpful factors from various therapy types, along with client preferences, are key in devising new therapeutic interventions.

Use of PEG-rHuMGDF in platelet engraftment after autologous stem cell transplantation,"['Karen K Fields', 'M Crump', 'I Bence-Bruckler[...]', 'Michael Lill']","This paper summarizes a pilot, sequential dose-escalation study of PEG-rHuMGDF in patients with advanced malignancies who had delayed platelet recovery after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Patients were randomized to receive either placebo (n = 11) or PEG-rHuMGDF at 5 (n = 9), 10 (n = 6), or 25 (n = 7) microg/kg/day by subcutaneous injection for 14 days and were monitored for 5 weeks. Across all treatment groups, eight patients had platelet recovery to > or = 20 x 10(9)/l by day 21. The proportion of patients achieving platelet recovery, the median number of days and units of platelet transfusions were similar for the placebo and the PEG-rHuMGDF groups. PEG-rHuMGDF was well tolerated at all dosages. The incidence rates of adverse events in all groups were similar. No deaths on study, no drug-related serious adverse events, and no development of neutralizing antibodies to MGDF occurred.",Article,0.0, Bone Marrow Transplantation,Nov 25,1,"

Assessing socioeconomic status in adolescents: the validity of a home affluence scale,"['J Wardle', 'Kathryn Robb', 'Fiona Johnson']","To examine the completion rate, internal reliability, and external validity of a home affluence scale based on adolescents' reports of material circumstances in the home as a measure of family socioeconomic status. Cross sectional survey. Data were collected from a school based study in seven schools in the north of England Cheshire over a five month period from September 1999 to January 2000. 1824 students (1248 girls, 567 boys) aged 13-15 years who were attending normal classes in Years 9 and 10 in 7 schools on the days of data collection. Main results: Comparatively poor completion rates were found for questions on parental education and occupation while material deprivation items had much higher completion rates. There was evidence that students with poorer material circumstances were less able to report parental education and occupation whereas material based questions showed less bias. A home affluence scale composed of material items was found to have adequate internal reliability and good external validity. A home affluence scale based on material markers provides a useful alternative in assessing family affluence in adolescents. Additionally, it prevents exclusion of those less materially well off adolescents who fail to complete conventional socioeconomic status items.",Article,2.0, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,,1,"

Brief ‘Appetitive Trait Tailored Intervention’: Development in a Sample of Adults with Overweight and Obesity,"['Claudia Hunot-Alexander', 'Helen Croker', 'Alison Fildes[...]', 'Rebecca J Beeken']","Appetitive traits are associated with weight and could be managed using behavioural strategies. Personalised approaches to weight loss could use a person's appetitive trait profile to tailor weight management advice. This study aimed to explore participants’ experiences of a brief Appetitive Trait Tailored Intervention (ATTI) based on participants’ Adult Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (AEBQ) scores. The ATTI was developed using strategies from modified Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and behaviour change techniques. Acceptability testing of the ATTI was carried out with participants (body mass index ≥25) who completed the AEBQ online and were sent their appetitive trait profile and corresponding weight loss tips via e-mail. Participants were asked to follow the tips for 8 weeks and following the tips, perceived helpfulness, barriers, and initial and final body weight. Qualitative interviews explored their experiences. Thirty-seven participants provided feedback and reported the majority of the tips to be helpful. Thirty-two participants (92.5% female) provided their final weight; 10 reported weight loss ≥5% of initial weight. Qualitative interviews (n = 21) revealed that tailoring was seen as novel and participants felt that the ATTI increased their self-awareness and encouraged behavioural changes. The low intensity of the ATTI limited engagement for some. The ATTI is an acceptable, novel approach to weight management.",Article,1.0, Behaviour Change,Nov 3,0,"

Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of TeleStroke consultations to support the care of patients who had a stroke presenting to regional emergency departments in Western Australia: an economic evaluation case study protocol,"['Christina Tsou', 'Suzanne Robinson', 'James H Boyd[...]', 'Delia Hendrie']","Introduction The Western Australia (WA) Acute TeleStroke Programme commenced incrementally across regional WA during 2016–2017. Since the introduction of the TeleStroke Programme, there has been monitoring of service outputs, including regional patient access to tertiary stroke specialist advice and reperfusion treatment; however, the impact of consultation with a stroke specialist via telehealth (videoconferencing or telephone) on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of stroke care and the drivers of cost-effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. Methods and analysis The aim of the case study was to examine the impact of consultation with a stroke specialist via telehealth on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of stroke and transient ischaemic attack care using a mixed methods approach. A categorical decision tree model will be constructed in collaboration with clinicians and programme managers. A before and after comparison using state-wide administrative datasets will be used to run the base model. If sample size and statistical power permits, the cases and comparators will be matched by stroke type and presence of CT scan at the initial site of presentation, age category and presenting hospital. The drivers of cost-effectiveness will be explored through stakeholder interviews. Data from the qualitative analysis will be cross-referenced with trends emerging from the quantitative dataset and used to guide the factors to be involved in subgroup and sensitivity analysis. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval for this case study has been granted from the Western Australian Country Health Service Human Research and Ethics Committee (RGS3076). Reciprocal approval

519Innovative use of MedicineInsight GP database for applied research on antibiotic prescribing in Western Australia,"['Amy Harrison', 'Suzanne Robinson', 'Linda Selvey[...]', 'Mark N. Harris']","Focus of Presentation This project showcases the use of existing general practice (GP) datasets to gain access to large-scale data for epidemiological research. There is limited quantitative research on antibiotic prescribing in Australian GP. The research question involves identifying predictors of antibiotic prescribing not in accordance with national therapeutic guidelines for urinary tract infection (UTI) in Western Australian (WA) GP. This requires large-scale, individual-level data, which is difficult to access in Australia, and in this case could not be achieved without collaboration. Findings Longitudinal records from 52 practices in WA participating in MedicineInsight were analyzed. GP datasets present challenges regarding cleaning, processing and storage. Substantial broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing was identified in initial episodes of UTI, particularly for children, and not supported by laboratory pathology. Children received broad-spectrum antibiotics 85% of the time, compared to 58% in women. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to elucidate patient- and consultation-related factors associated with antibiotic prescribing outside of the guidelines. Conclusions/Implications There is evidence of antibiotic prescribing outside of the guidelines for initial presentations of UTI in WA GP. Whilst GP datasets provide insightful information on antibiotic prescribing, it is important to explore these findings with practising clinicians to further understand the drivers behind this behaviour, and this is the next stage of this research. Key messages Collaborative partnerships can facilitate access to rich, large-scale datasets capable of answering important research questions in Australian primary care.",Article,1.0, International Journal of Epidemiology,,0,"

The EU diaspora in the UK cannot be ignored (LSE Brexit),"['Zana Vathi', 'Ruxandra Trandafoiu']","While formally Brexit may be behind us, the EU diaspora in the UK is becoming a political actor Brexiters could not foresee, write Zana Vathi and Ruxandra Trandafoiu (Edge Hill University). They argue that a 'civic' Europeanness was activated by Brexit and has started to create bridges among Europeans in the UK who are emerging as a dynamic diaspora collective of political significance. The promises made by the UK government to EU nationals in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 Referendum have not been fulfilled. Instead, they were quickly replaced with the lengthy bureaucracy of the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) and the stark choice of continued residence in the UK under tougher conditions or return to the countries of origin. What Brexiters and the UK government did not foresee was the powerful mix of geopolitical interests and emotional stakes shared by EU nationals, who bonded together to become political actors in their own right, across linguistic and cultural differences.",Article,,,,0,"

Phase 1 study of pegylated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEG-rHuMGDF) in breast cancer patients after autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation,"['B.J. Bolwell', 'J Vredenburgh', 'Beth Overmoyer[...]', 'J Glaspy']","Forty-seven patients with stage II, III, or IV breast cancer undergoing autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation were randomized to placebo (n = 13) or to one of five sequential dose cohorts of pegylated (PEG) recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEG-rHuMGDF) (1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, or 10.0 microg/kg/day) (n= 34). Blinded study drug was started on the day of transplantation and was continued until the platelet count was > or =100 x 109/l or a maximum of 21 days. PBPCs were mobilized with filgrastim (r-metHuG-CSF) and all patients received filgrastim starting on day +2 after transplantation. The nadir platelet count was not affected by treatment. The median time to platelet recovery was 11 and 12 days for the placebo and combined PEG-rHuMGDF groups, respectively. No trends in adverse events suggested dose- or treatment-related toxicity. Two patients withdrew from the study because of an adverse event (allergic reaction in the 7.5 microg/kg group) probably related to study drug, and veno-occlusive disease (VOD) (in the 5 microg/kg group) which was felt not to be related to study drug by the investigator. No patients developed neutralizing antibodies to MGDF. Day +21 and day +28 platelet counts were higher in the group receiving PEG-rHuMGDF (246 vs 148 x 109/l and 299 vs 145 x 109/l, respectively; both P < 0. 05). PEG-rHuMGDF up to 10 microg/kg/day was well tolerated. In this study, there was no effect of study drug on initial platelet engraftment at the doses studied.

Why do early years educators engage with phonics policy directives in their work with under-threes in England?,['Karen Marie Boardman'],"This paper explores how the neoliberal policy directives relating to the teaching of phonics in schools in England, influences the pedagogy of early years educators (EYEs) working with under-threes. The research highlights that these EYEs are confounded by early reading (ER), given that there is no clear definition or provision separating ER from the mandatory teaching of phonics in schools. This paper asserts that it is vital to detach provision for ER for under-threes from the ‘formal’ teaching of phonics recommended for schools. In addition, EYEs require immediate support to become ‘resistant’ to such inappropriate policy directives, persistently driven by the school readiness agenda and the ‘datafication’ and inequality of early years pedagogy, previously highlighted by Roberts-Holmes and Bradbury.",Article,1.0, Policy Futures in Education,Apr 22,1,"

Widespread Exposures of Extensive Clean Shallow Ice in the Mid‐Latitudes of Mars,"['Colin M. Dundas', 'Michael T. Mellon', 'Susan J. Conway[...]', 'Asmin V. Pathare']","Although ice in the Martian midlatitudes is typically covered by a layer of dust or regolith, it is exposed in some locations by fresh impact craters or in erosional scarps. In both cases, the exposed ice is massive or excess ice with a low lithic content. We find that erosional scarps occur between 50° and 61° north and south latitude and that they are concentrated in and near Milankovič crater in the northern hemisphere and southeast of the Hellas basin in the southern hemisphere. These may represent locations of particularly thick or clean bodies of ice. Pits created by retreat of the scarps represent sublimation‐thermokarst landforms that evolve in a manner distinct from other ice‐loss landforms on Mars. New impact craters reveal that clean subsurface ice is widespread at middle‐ and high‐latitudes in both hemispheres at depths less than 1 m. Both the depth to ice and the ice content appear to exhibit significant variability over tens to hundreds of meters. The lowest‐latitude exposed ice is near 39°N and is at the edge of a region where impact exposures between 40° and 50°N are common, consistent with other indications of a high ice content. This lowest‐latitude ice may be currently unstable and subliming. Impact craters on lineated valley fill excavate ice blocks that may represent the top of debris‐covered glacial ice. Together, these landforms indicate widespread, clean subsurface ice at middle‐latitudes on Mars. The distribution and properties of this ice could provide information about past climate conditions.",Article,1.0, The Journal of Geophysical Research Planets,Jan 29,1,"

Regularity and Continuity of GP Contacts and Use of Statins Amongst People at Risk of Cardiovascular Events,"['David Youens', 'Jenny Doust', 'Suzanne Robinson', 'Rachael E Moorin']","Background: Regularity and continuity of general practitioner (GP) contacts are associated with reduced hospitalisation. Opportunities for improved medication management are cited as a potential cause. Objective: Determine associations between continuity and regularity of primary care and statin use amongst individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. Design: Observational cohort study using self-report and administrative data from 267,153 participants of the Sax Institute's 45 and Up Study conducted in New South Wales, Australia. from 2006 to 2009. Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) data, from Services Australia, were linked to survey, hospital and death data by the NSW Centre for Health Record Linkage. Participants: The 45 and Up Study participants at risk of CVD outcomes based on self-report and administrative data, divided into existing users and potential users based on dispensing records through the exposure period. Main measures: The Continuity of Care index (COC), measuring whether patients see the same GP, and an index assessing whether GP visits are on a regular basis, measured from July 2011 to June 2012. Amongst potential users, statin initiation from July 2012 to June 2013 was assessed using logistic regression; amongst existing users, adherence was assessed from July 2012 to June 2015 using Cox regression (non-adherence being 30 days without statins). Key results: Amongst 29,420 potential users, the most regular quintile had 1.22 times the odds of initiating statin (95%CI 1.11-1.34), while the high continuity group had an odds ratio of 1.12 (95%CI 1.02-1.24).

The patient reported to the department of prosthodontics after the healing of cranioplasty wound, and hence, was not willing for further surgical intervention to correct the defect. Thus, it was decided to manage the defect through extra-cranial prosthetic rehabilitation. Among the numerous maxillofacial prosthetic materials, room temperature vulcanizing silicone material was selected for fabrication of the final prosthesis. Pigmentation and shade matching were done for improved aesthetics. The prosthesis tremendously improved her quality of life in terms of appearance and confidence.

In analyses that included both restraint and body dissatisfaction as independent predictors, restraint was associated only with more negative attitudes to eating, whereas body dissatisfaction was significantly associated with all the adverse outcomes. These results cast doubt on the proposition that restrained eating is a primary cause of bulimic symptoms, emotional eating, and psychological distress seen in individuals who are trying to control their weight, and rather suggest that body dissatisfaction is the key factor.",Article,5.0, Journal of Abnormal Psychology,,1,"

The Adolescent Food Habits Checklist: reliability and validity of a measure of healthy eating behaviour in adolescents,"['Fiona Johnson', 'J Wardle', 'J Griffith']","Amid concerns about the quality of young people's diets, this paper describes the development of a measure of healthy eating behaviour for use with adolescents. Items for the measure were selected from a larger pool on the basis of responses from a pilot study. The 23-item checklist was validated using measures of dietary fat and fibre intake, fruit and vegetable consumption, dietary restraint, nutrition knowledge and a measure of family income. Participants came from seven secondary schools in the north-west of England. A total of 1822 adolescents aged between 13 and 16 y took part in the study, representing 84% of those invited to participate. Correlations between measures indicate a good level of convergent validity, and the checklist is also shown to have high internal and test-retest reliability. The focus on choices available to adolescents means that the checklist will provide a useful addition to food frequency-type approaches to the measurement of adolescent eating behaviour.

Public Preferences for Allocating Ventilators in an Intensive Care Unit: A Discrete Choice Experiment,"['Richard Norman', 'Suzanne Robinson', 'Helen Dickinson[...]', 'Matthew Anstey']","Background and objective: During the COVID-19 pandemic, resources in intensive care units (ICUs) have the potential to be inadequate to treat all those who might benefit. Therefore, it is paramount to identify the views of the community regarding how to allocate such resources. This study aims to quantify Australian community preferences for ventilation allocation. Methods: A discrete choice experiment was designed and administrated to an adult Australian online panel. Each survey respondent answered 12 choice sets from a total design of 120. Each choice set placed the respondent in the role of hypothetical decision maker, prioritising care between two patients. Conditional logit, mixed logit regression and latent class analysis were used to analyse the data. Additionally, we asked a series of attitudinal questions about different methods of making such decisions in practice, focusing on who should be responsible. Results: A total of 1050 community members completed the survey and responded to each choice. Dimensions considered most important were age, likely effectiveness, smoking status, whether the person has dependents, whether they are a healthcare worker, and whether they have a disability or not. Estimating marginal rates of substitution between patient characteristics and chance of survival if ventilated yielded values of up to 30 percentage points if the patient was 70 years old relative to being 30. However, respondents typically said they would prefer such decisions to be made by medical professionals. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the preferences of the community to allocation of ventilators during the COVID-19 pandemic.

WHAT CAN BE LEARNT FROM 130 CHILDREN'S DREAM WHEELCHAIR DESIGNS? ELICITING CHILD-CENTRED INSIGHTS USING AN INTERDISCIPLINARY DESIGN ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK,"['Cara Shaw', 'Farnaz Nickpour', 'Francesca Bernardi']","The design of inclusive paediatric mobility (IPM) interventions, such as children's wheelchairs, are entangled with technological, health and social considerations. As narratives around childhood, disability and mobility shift and transform, these entanglements evolve. In order to optimise the experience of childhood mobility, IPM designers must understand and respond to such changes and channel children's own requirements, desires and 'dreams' into the design process; this can be achieved by utilising a child-centred design approach. This paper identifies meaningful child-centred IPM design insights and opportunities through the interdisciplinary analysis of 130 dream wheelchair designs by disabled children, aged 4 to 17 years. A novel interdisciplinary and child-centred design analysis framework is developed to dissect, categorise and code the topics and features expressed through visuals and written descriptions in each of the children's dream wheelchair designs. Children's mobility narratives, desires and requirements are elicited and trending topics are discussed. It is proposed that valuing children's voices in the IPM design process could alter both the process of designing IPM interventions as well as the product outcomes.",Conference Paper,,,Aug 6,1,"

The effects of pegylated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEG-rHuMGDF) on platelet recovery in breast cancer patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation,"['Michael W Schuster', 'Roy Beveridge', 'Debra Frei-Lahr[...]', 'Edmund K Waller']","To assess the safety and efficacy of pegylated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEG-rHuMGDF) administered after autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were done. In the phase 1/2 study, 75 breast cancer patients underwent a bone marrow harvest and myeloablative STAMP V chemotherapy and were randomized to receive placebo or one of three doses of PEG-rHuMGDF. In the phase 3 study, 64 patients were randomized to receive placebo or the minimally effective dose of PEG-rHuMGDF. The study drug was administered daily starting on the day of bone marrow infusion until the platelet count was greater than or equal to 50 x 10(9)/L (without transfusion) or for a maximum of 28 days. All patients received 10 microg/kg/day filgrastim starting on day 2 until neutrophil count recovery. PEG-rHuMGDF appeared to be safe and well tolerated. No significant differences were noted in mortality or disease progression rates. Antibodies to MGDF were not observed. In the phase 1/2 study, the time to platelet recovery to greater than or equal to 20 x 10(9)/L and platelet transfusion requirements were significantly reduced for patients treated with PEG-rHuMGDF compared with placebo (p < 0.05). In the phase 3 study, no significant differences in the kinetics of early thrombopoiesis or platelet transfusions after ABMT were observed. PEG-rHuMGDF was not consistently efficacious in reducing the duration of severe thrombocytopenia.

Visual Cues Given by Humans Are Not Sufficient for Asian Elephants (Elephas maximus) to Find Hidden Food,"['Joshua M Plotnik', 'Jen Pokorny', 'Titiporn Keratimanochaya[...]', 'David Getz']","Recent research suggests that domesticated species - due to artificial selection by humans for specific, preferred behavioral traits - are better than wild animals at responding to visual cues given by humans about the location of hidden food. \Although this seems to be supported by studies on a range of domesticated (including dogs, goats and horses) and wild (including wolves and chimpanzees) animals, there is also evidence that exposure to humans positively influences the ability of both wild and domesticated animals to follow these same cues. Here, we test the performance of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) on an object choice task that provides them with visual-only cues given by humans about the location of hidden food. Captive elephants are interesting candidates for investigating how both domestication and human exposure may impact cue-following as they represent a non-domesticated species with almost constant human interaction. As a group, the elephants (n = 7) in our study were unable to follow pointing, body orientation or a combination of both as honest signals of food location. They were, however, able to follow vocal commands with which they were already familiar in a novel context, suggesting the elephants are able to follow cues if they are sufficiently salient. Although the elephants' inability to follow the visual cues provides partial support for the domestication hypothesis, an alternative explanation is that elephants may rely more heavily on other sensory modalities, specifically olfaction and audition. Further research will be needed to rule out this alternative explanation.",Article,3.0, PLoS ONE,,1,"

The COVID-19 pandemic: the essential role of the voluntary sector in emergency response and resilience planning,"['Claire Bynner', 'Maureen McBride', 'Sarah Weakley']","This research note highlights the need to engage the voluntary sector in strategic emergency response and resilience planning with the local state. It draws on qualitative fieldwork in two Scottish local authorities, which explored service responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in high-poverty neighbourhoods. The data comprised 25 interviews with front-line workers and senior managers in voluntary sector and public sector organisations. Interviews were conducted during the spring 2020 lockdown and subsequent easing of restrictions. The article employs Young’s (2000) models of government to analyse the relationship between voluntary organisations and the state. The findings indicate that this iterative crisis requires the relational skills of the voluntary sector to supplement the local state and provide a sustainable response to the needs of vulnerable populations. There is a need for a new strategic and complementary relationship, one that fully engages locally embedded voluntary organisations at all stages of emergency response and resilience planning.",Article,1.0, Voluntary Sector Review,Jul 19,0,"

How unhealthy commodity industries find a global audience in the English Premier League. Three case studies of brand engagement,"['Robin Ireland', 'Christopher Bunn', 'Stephanie Chambers', 'Gerda Reith']","Background: Establishing the English Premier League has resulted in a dramatic rise in commercial activities, raising public health concerns around unhealthy brand marketing. Methods: Three linked case studies analysed the marketing techniques of three of the Premier League’s partners in the 2019/20 season: Coca-Cola, Budweiser, and Cadbury. Data from Twitter were triangulated with promotional materials, product promotions in supermarkets and grey literature. An inductive thematic analysis explored the strategies used to engage fans. Results: The studies show sponsors purchasing access to fans and inserting their brands into the emotional and passionate environment of EPL football. Sponsors evoke cultural traditions to align with and engage fans, to encourage consumption. Consumption is ‘responsibilised’ and positioned as an individual choice. Conclusions: The marketing techniques identified exploit social and cultural dimensions of EPL football to increase consumption of unhealthy brands, with the potential to negatively impact on the health of the EPL’s audience.",Article,1.0, Soccer and Society,,0,"

Inhibition of myocardial cathepsin-L release during reperfusion following myocardial infarction improves cardiac function and reduces infarct size,"['Weihong He', 'Charlotte McCarroll', 'Katrin Nather[...]', 'Christopher Michael Loughrey']","Aims Identifying novel mediators of lethal myocardial reperfusion injury that can be targeted during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is key to limiting the progression of patients with ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) to heart failure. Here we show through parallel clinical and integrative preclinical studies the significance of the protease cathepsin-L on cardiac function during reperfusion injury. Methods and Results We found that direct cardiac release of cathepsin-L in STEMI patients (n = 76) immediately post-PPCI leads to elevated serum cathepsin-L levels and that serum levels of cathepsin-L in the first 24 hour post-reperfusion are associated with reduced cardiac contractile function and increased infarct size. Preclinical studies, demonstrate that inhibition of cathepsin-L release following reperfusion injury with CAA0225 reduces infarct size and improves cardiac contractile function by limiting abnormal cardiomyocyte calcium handling and apoptosis. Conclusion Our findings suggest that cathepsin-L is a novel therapeutic target that could be exploited clinically to counteract the deleterious effects of acute reperfusion injury after an acute STEMI. Translational perspective New therapeutic targets are urgently required to limit myocardial damage after reperfusion injury. We identified cardiac release of the protease cathepsin-L among patients following primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). Elevated serum levels of cathepsin-L were associated with reduced contractile function and increased infarct size at 24 hour and 6 months post-PPCI. Work conducted using animal models indicated that cardiac release of cathepsin-L mediated cardiac dysfunction following reperfusion injury. Specific inhibit

"Lights, camera, provocation? Exploring experiences of surveillance in the policing of Scottish football","['Niall Hamilton-Smith', 'Maureen McBride', 'Colin Atkinson']","Based primarily on research into the policing of football fans in Scotland following the implementation of the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications Act (Scotland) Act 2012 this paper examines the interplay of police techniques and surveillance technologies in the policing of Scottish football. There has been relatively little academic attention directed towards the Act, so the question of why and how this flagship legislation generated such intense opposition that it was repealed within six years of its introduction demands investigation. This paper explores the implementation of the Act from the perspectives of football fans, criminal justice agencies, and representatives of football clubs, with a specific focus on the impact of police surveillance practices. The research uncovered strong perceptions that such practices were considered intimidatory, which may have weakened the perceived legitimacy of the Act. This paper poses a challenge to simple readings of evidence in terms of the claimed benefits of particular forms of surveillance, arguing that the use of technologies such as powerful hand-held cameras and body worn video (BWV) has had a detrimental impact on police-fan relationships, interactions and dialogue.",Article,1.0, Policing and Society,Mar 21,0,"

The impact of the initial Covid-19 lockdown upon regular sports bettors in Britain: Findings from a cross-sectional online study,"['Heather Wardle', 'Craig Donnachie', 'Nathan Hunt[...]', 'Kate Hunt']","Background In Britain, unprecedented restrictions on daily life associated with the Covid-19 pandemic included the suspension of professional sports events during the initial ‘lockdown’. This provides opportunities to observe changes in sports bettors’ behaviour when their primary form of activity is removed and assess the impact of Covid-19 related circumstances upon gambling. Methods In July 2020, we conducted an online cross-sectional survey of people who bet regularly (at least monthly) on sports before Covid-19 (n=3866). Bi-variate analyses compared changes in gambling behaviours before and during the initial lockdown. Multi-variate logistic regression models explored associations between problem gambling (men) and moderate risk or problem gambling (MRPG) (women) with changes in Covid-19 related circumstances and changing gambling behaviours during Britain’s initial ‘lockdown’ (March-June 2020). Results 29.8% of male sports bettors and 33.4% of female sports bettors stopped gambling altogether during the initial Covid-19 lockdown, though 17.3% of men and 16.5% of women started a new form of gambling during lockdown. Among men, adjusted odds ratios of problem gambling were higher among those starting a new gambling activity during lockdown (OR=2.50 [95% CI 1.38-4.53]). Among women, adjusted odds ratios of MRPG were higher among those whose frequency of gambling on any activity increased during lockdown (OR=4.21 [1.99-8.92] and among those shielding for health reasons. Poorer wellbeing was associated with problem gambling for men and MRPH for women.

Regulatory Resistance? Narratives and Uses of Evidence around “Black Market” Provision of Gambling during the British Gambling Act Review,"['Heather Wardle', 'Gerda Reith', 'Fiona Dobbie[...]', 'Jeremy Shiffman']","Commercial gambling is increasingly viewed as being part of the unhealthy commodities industries, in which products contribute to preventable ill-health globally. Britain has one of the world’s most liberal gambling markets, meaning that the regulatory changes there have implications for developments elsewhere. A review of the British Gambling Act 2005 is underway. This has generated a range of actions by the industry, including mobilising arguments around the threat of the “black market”. We critically explore industry’s framing of these issues as part of their strategy to resist regulatory change during the Gambling Act review. We used a predefined review protocol to explore industry narratives about the “black market” in media reports published between 8 December 2020 and 26 May 2021. Fifty-five articles were identified and reviewed, and themes were narratively synthesised to examine industry framing of the “black market”. The black market was framed in terms of economic threat and loss, and a direct connection was made between its growth and increased regulation. The articles mainly presented gambling industry perspectives uncritically, citing industry-generated evidence (n = 40). Industry narratives around the “black market” speak to economically and emotionally salient concerns: fear, safety, consumer freedom and economic growth. This dominant framing in political, mainstream and industry media may influence political and public opinion to support the current status quo: “protecting” the existing regulated market rather than “protecting” people. Debates should be reframed to consider all policy options, especially those designed to protect public health.",Literature Review,1.0, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,Nov 6,1,"

Post-stenting fractional flow reserve vs coronary angiography for optimisation of percutaneous coronary intervention: TARGET-FFR trial,"['Damien Collison', 'Matthaios Didagelos', 'Muhammad Aetesam-ur-Rahman[...]', 'Keith G Oldroyd']","Aims : A fractional flow reserve (FFR) value ≥0.90 after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with a reduced risk of adverse cardiovascular events. TARGET-FFR is an investigator-initiated, single-centre, randomized controlled trial to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a post-PCI FFR-guided optimization strategy vs. standard coronary angiography in achieving final post-PCI FFR values ≥0.90. Methods and results : After angiographically guided PCI, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive a physiology-guided incremental optimization strategy (PIOS) or a blinded coronary physiology assessment (control group). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a final post-PCI FFR ≥0.90. Final FFR ≤0.80 was a prioritized secondary outcome. A total of 260 patients were randomized (131 to PIOS, 129 to control) and 68.1% of patients had an initial post-PCI FFR <0.90. In the PIOS group, 30.5% underwent further intervention (stent post-dilation and/or additional stenting). There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of the proportion of patients with final post-PCI FFR ≥0.90 between groups (PIOS minus control 10%, 95% confidence interval -1.84 to 21.91, P = 0.099). The proportion of patients with a final FFR ≤0.80 was significantly reduced when compared with the angiography-guided control group (-11.2%, 95% confidence interval -21.87 to -0.35], P = 0.045). Conclusion : Over two-thirds of patients had a physiologically suboptimal result after angiography-guided PCI. An FFR-guided optimization strategy did not significantly increase the proportion of patients with a final FFR ≥0.90, but did reduce the proportion of patients with a final FFR ≤0.80.",Article,1.0, European Heart Journal,Jul 22,1,"

Abstract P1-10-29: Radiomics improved pre-therapeutic prediction of breast cancers insensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy,"['Xuezhi Zhou', 'Zhenyu Liu', 'Yang Du[...]', 'Jie Tian']","Background: Approximately 10–35% of breast cancers were found to be insensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), and approximately 5% of patients had larger tumors after NAC; in these patients, NAC failed to exhibit a therapeutic effect and instead delayed surgical treatment. Thus, it is critical to identify predictive biomarkers to enhance patient selection for NAC. Here we report a radiomic model for pre-therapeutic prediction of breast cancers insensitive to NAC. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 125 breast cancer patients (63 in the primary cohort and 62 in the validation cohort) who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (imaging sequence: diffusion-weighted, T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted) before receiving NAC. All patients received surgical resection, and Miller-Payne grading system were applied to assess the response to NAC. Grade 1-2 cases were classified as insensitive to NAC. We extracted 1941 radiomic features in the primary cohort. After feature selection, the optimal feature set was used to construct a radiomic signature using machine learning. We built a combined prediction model incorporating the radiomic signature and independent clinical risk factors using multivariable logistic regression. The performance of the combined model was assessed in the validation cohort. Results: The radiomic signature consisting 4 features showed good performance for identifying Grade 1-2 group, yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 (95% confidence interval: 0.647–1) in the validation cohort. A clinical model based on human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) status and Ki67 index yielded an AUC of 0.792 (95% confidence interval: 0.668–0.916) in the validation co

Radiomics of multi-parametric MRI for pretreatment prediction of pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer: a multicenter study,"['Zhenyu Liu', 'Zhuolin Li', 'Jinrong Qu[...]', 'Jie Tian']","Purpose: We evaluated the performance of the newly proposed radiomics of multiparametric MRI (RMM), developed and validated based on a multicenter dataset adopting a radiomic strategy, for pretreatment prediction of pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. Experimental design: A total of 586 potentially eligible patients were retrospectively enrolled from four hospitals (primary cohort and external validation cohort 1-3). Quantitative imaging features were extracted from T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging before NAC for each patient. With features selected using a coarse to fine feature selection strategy, four radiomic signatures were constructed based on each of the three MRI sequences and their combination. RMM was developed based on the best radiomic signature incorporating with independent clinicopathologic risk factors. The performance of RMM was assessed with respect to its discrimination and clinical usefulness, and compared with that of clinical information-based prediction model. Results: Radiomic signature combining multiparametric MRI achieved an AUC of 0.79 (the highest among the four radiomic signatures). The signature further achieved good performances in hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative group and triple-negative group. RMM yielded an AUC of 0.86, which was significantly higher than that of clinical model in two of the three external validation cohorts. Conclusions: The study suggested a possibility that RMM provided a potential tool to develop a model for predicting pCR to NAC in breast cancer.",Article,9.0, Clinical Cancer Research,,0,"

(Not) a good place to stay! – East European migrants’ experiences of settlement in disadvantaged neighbourhoods in Scotland,"['Rebecca Kay', 'Paulina Trevena']","In this article, we ask how migrants establish social relationships, attachments and feelings of belonging within and to disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Drawing on extensive qualitative research with East European migrants in Scotland, we explore empirically the material, relational and temporal aspects of experiences of settlement at the neighbourhood level. We consider the ways in which migrants encounter and assess the material and institutional realities of their neighbourhoods. We examine the social relationships which develop in place, paying attention to social and cultural distancing and mutual ‘othering’, which may run counter to the development of place-based bonds. We discuss the role of time and the processual and ambiguous nature of settlement. Importantly, in our analysis, we consider the possibility that theoretical frameworks developed specifically for understanding migrant experiences might overemphasise their uniqueness and risk overlooking similarities grounded in multi-scalar hierarchies of power, which cut across lines of ethnic or cultural difference. We draw on wider theories and studies of place-attachment, as well as migration studies theories of embedding and emplacement, to explore the ways in which our participants’ experiences may be understood as both similar to and different from more widely shared realities of life in deprived areas.",Article,1.0, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,Feb 20,0,"

Genome-wide detection and sequence conservation analysis of long non-coding RNA during hair follicle cycle of yak,"['Xiaolan Zhang', 'Qi Bao', 'Congjun Jia[...]', 'pl Yan']","Background: Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) as an important regulator has been demonstrated playing an indispensable role in the biological process of hair follicles (HFs) growth. However, their function and expression profile in the HFs cycle of yak are yet unknown. Only a few functional lncRNAs have been identified, partly due to the low sequence conservation and lack of identified conserved properties in lncRNAs. Here, lncRNA-seq was employed to detect the expression profile of lncRNAs during the HFs cycle of yak, and the sequence conservation of two datasets between yak and cashmere goat during the HFs cycle was analyzed. Results: A total of 2884 lncRNAs were identified in 5 phases (Jan., Mar., Jun., Aug., and Oct.) during the HFs cycle of yak. Then, differential expression analysis between 3 phases (Jan., Mar., and Oct.) was performed, revealing that 198 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) were obtained in the Oct.-vs-Jan. group, 280 DELs were obtained in the Jan.-vs-Mar. group, and 340 DELs were obtained in the Mar.-vs-Oct. group. Subsequently, the nearest genes of lncRNAs were searched as the potential target genes and used to explore the function of DELs by GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. Several critical pathways involved in HFs development such as Wnt signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, and signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells, were enriched. To further screen key lncRNAs influencing the HFs cycle, 24 DELs with differ degree of sequence conservation were obtained via a comparative analysis of partial DELs with previously published lncRNA-seq data of cashmere goat in the HFs cycle using NCBI BLAST-2.9.0+, and 3 DELs of them were randomly selected for further detailed a

We argue that the effects on R&D investment are more complex than the previous literature suggests. We show theoretically that, in unlevelled industries, the laggard’s R&D investment decreases with product substitutability regardless of the R&D productivity level. In sharp contrast, in levelled industries, whether R&D investment increases or decreases with product substitutability depends crucially on the level of the R&D productivity. We choose parameters and formulate testable predictions that we take to the laboratory. We find that subjects’ behavior is largely consistent with the model’s predictions.",Article,1.0, Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization,,1,"

Age-Optimal Transmission Policy with HARQ for Freshness-Critical Vehicular Status Updates in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks,"['Ying Wang', 'Shaohua Wu', 'Jian Jiao[...]', 'Qinyu Zhang']","In this paper, we investigate the freshness of the vehicular status updates in space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN), where the status updates are generated by sampling a fixed-rate dynamic Markov process and delivered to the monitor over an unreliable channel instantaneously. The age of information (AoI) is adopted to capture the timeliness of the status updates. Two Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) schemes, namely, classical HARQ scheme and incremental redundancy HARQ (IR-HARQ) scheme, are taken into consideration to combat the errors occurred in the transmission. In this setting, once an update is not decoded successfully, one should carefully decide how to schedule the updates for optimizing the AoI. Especially, differential encoding scheme is introduced in the considered system to exploit the temporal correlations of the source. By differential encoding, each update can be actual or differential, based on the differential encoding level. To minimize the long-term average age, we formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and prove that the optimal transmission policies for classical HARQ scheme and IR-HARQ scheme behave differently in threshold structures. Further, we jointly optimize the codeword length, differential encoding level and retransmission times to minimize the AoI. The performance comparison shows the advantages of IR-HARQ scheme over classical HARQ scheme from the age perspective.",Article,0.0, IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,0,"

Efficacy and Safety of TangWang Prescription for Type 2 Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy: A Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"['De Jin', 'Yuehong Zhang', 'Yuqing Zhang[...]', 'Xiaolin Tong']","Background: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common and severe microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus (DM), which results in blindness among adults worldwide. Presently, the efficacy of drug treatments for diabetic retinopathy (DR) is not satisfactory, thus urgently necessitating effective drug treatment measures. TangWang prescription (TWP) has been found to have retinal protection effects in previous clinical and basic research. However, there is a lack of rigorous, randomized, and controlled studies. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TWP in delaying the development of DR. Methods: This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial, consisting of 384 participants to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio in the treatment and control groups. Furthermore, the treatment and control groups will be administered the TangWang prescription and the placebo, respectively, each at a dose of one bag twice a day. The study period will last for 48 weeks. The primary outcome measure will be the changes in the degree of retinal microvascular lesions before and after treatment. The secondary outcome will be changes in the degree of hemangioma, microvascular bleeding, microvascular leakage, macular edema, and vision. All statistical tests will be two-sided, and a p < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Discussion: We hypothesize that the patients with DR will benefit from TangWang prescription, and in addition to the central random system and platform of dynamic information collection, the patients’ conditions will be monitored, and the data collected for analysis.

Two-timescale evolution of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals: Waveform generation scheme for quasicircular orbits in Schwarzschild spacetime,"['Jeremy Miller', 'Adam Pound']","Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, in which a stellar-mass compact object spirals into a supermassive black hole in a galactic core, are expected to be key sources for LISA. Modeling these systems with sufficient accuracy for LISA science requires going to second (or postadiabatic) order in gravitational self-force theory. Here we present a practical two-timescale framework for achieving this and generating postadiabatic waveforms. The framework comprises a set of frequency-domain field equations that apply on the fast, orbital timescale, together with a set of ordinary differential equations that determine the evolution on the slow, inspiral timescale. Our analysis is restricted to the special case of quasicircular orbits around a Schwarzschild black hole, but its general structure carries over to the realistic case of generic (inclined and eccentric) orbits in Kerr spacetime. In our restricted context, we also develop a tool that will be useful in all cases: a formulation of the frequency-domain field equations using hyperboloidal slicing, which significantly improves the behavior of the sources near the boundaries. We give special attention to the slow evolution of the central black hole, examining its impact on both the two-timescale evolution and the earlier self-consistent evolution scheme.",Article,,,,0,"

Transitions on frailty status and related risk factors for its status worsening: finding from the Beijing MJ Health Screening Center,"['J N Fan', 'S C Yang', 'Z J Sun[...]', 'Lin Li']","Objective: To evaluate the transitions of frailty status and related factors influencing its worsening in middle-aged and elderly adults. Methods: Data was obtained from the Beijing MJ Health Screening Center. A total of 13 689 participants who attended health checkups at least twice during 2008-2019 and had more than three years' intervals during these two health checkups were included in the study. The frailty index comprising 28 variables was used to measure frailty status. Frailty was defined as frailty index ≥0.25, and prefrailty was defined as frailty index >0.10 and <0.25. Logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the association of socio-demographic factors and lifestyle characteristics with the worsening of frailty status, stratified by frailty status at the first health checkup. Results: The mean age at the first and last health checkups were (42.3±9.2) and (47.9±9.3) years, respectively. The mean interval during these two health checkups was (5.7±1.9) years. At the first health checkup, the prevalence of frailty and prefrailty were 2.5% and 50.3%, respectively. While at the last health checkup, the prevalence of frailty and prefrailty rose to 3.9% and 55.4%. Of all participants, 67.3% remained in the same frailty state, 21.2% worsening, and 12.5% improving. In robust participants at the first health checkup, older age, female, low education level, smoking cessation, daily smoking, being general obesity measured by BMI or central obesity measured by WHR showed an increased the risk of worsening frailty status. However, in prefrail participants at the first health checkup, older age, female, general, or central obesity presented as risk factors for worsening frailty status.

Investigation of a semi-empirical load model of natural gas explosion in vented spaces,"['Shigang Yang', 'Jiongwei Cai', 'Qin Fang[...]', 'Qi Bao']","Due to the influence of many factors, the overpressure–time history load model of vented gas explosions is difficult to describe and is not conducive to further structural design. Based on vented gas explosion test data, this paper obtains three typical overpressure-time history curves and puts forward a new semi-empirical model— double hump model that considers gas concentration and venting pressure, and gives a formula for peak pressure and overpressure–time history model. The scientificity of the model is then verified by the total impulse in the load. The model is able directly reflect the load characteristics, provide reference for calculating key parameters of a vented gas explosion and provide information on the structural response under the load. The model thereby has the potential to help reduce the impact of gas explosion disasters.",Article,,,Sep 1,0,"

The early Neolithic flint mines of Sussex and their wider environs (4000-3650 BC),['Jon Baczkowski'],"The study of Early Neolithic flint mining began in the late 19th century in Sussex with a series of seminal excavations at chalk downland sites, including Blackpatch, Church Hill, Cissbury and Harrow Hill. Over the next century further excavations and research on the Sussex mines contributed to the narrative of the Neolithic period in southern England. The Early Neolithic flint mines of Sussex remain one of the earliest forms of large-scale monument to be constructed in the British Isles and their products, mostly finely made bifacial axes, were widely distributed across the region. Numerous flint mines are also found across Northwest Europe, including extensive complexes in Belgium, France, Poland and the Netherlands, and the act of extracting flint from deep workings remains a defining element of the Neolithic. Research on the English flint mines has diminished in recent decades, with no new fieldwork carried out for over 30 years, in contrast to Continental Europe where numerous sites are still under excavation. This thesis combines archival research and reassessment of previous research with new fieldwork, radiocarbon dates and other data to question longstanding interpretations of the Sussex mines. It is proposed that flint mines were pivotal monuments to the creation, development and spread of nascent Early Neolithic practices and cultural identities from the very start of the period in southern England. The thesis develops the study of flint mining beyond the immediate mine workings and into the wider landscape. Finally, this thesis increases knowledge on the communities who extracted flint from deep beneath the ground from the start of the Neolithic, one of the most important periods in the prehistory of the British Isles.",Thesis,,,Apr 10,0,"

The ground overpressure was recorded by using the piezoresistive sensors. An ideal film was validated before the tests. The effects of the methane concentration and gas volume on the deflagration load were analyzed.

This method provides access to a number of biologically important chiral molecules such as dihydrobenzofurans, indolines and indanes. The incorporated alkenyl group is suitable for further reactions that can lead to an increase in molecular diversity and complexity.

Determinants of SMEs’ Financial Performance: Evidence from an Emerging Economy,"['Gabriel sam Ahinful', 'Danquah Boakye', 'Nana Bempah']","Financial performance (FP) is important to every firm, especially SMEs, but FP determinants are debatable. This paper investigates determinants of FP among Ghanaian SMEs. Employing a survey data set of 238 SMEs, multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the extent to which each firm-specific characteristic and industry impact FP. The findings show that a significant relationship exists between company ownership type and FP. There is also a positive link between firm age, firm size, and FP. The industry effect is significant in the services sector. The results also show that the impact of firm-specific characteristics and industry differs across the sub-components of FP and manufacturing and service industries. The results demonstrate the relevance of the tenets of resource base view and structure- conduct-performance in explaining the SMEs' FP variations in a developing country context.

"Correlation between chronic diseases and low muscle mass, strength and quality in adults in China","['Q R Wen', 'M Wu', 'Q Liu[...]', 'Lin Li']","Objective: To explore the correlation between chronic diseases and muscle mass, strength and quality in adults in China. Methods: Based on the second resurvey of China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) in 2013-2014, logistic regression models were used to analyze the correlation of different types, number and duration of chronic diseases with low muscle mass, handgrip strength and muscle quality. Results: The prevalence rate of diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were 9.6%, 5.8%, 3.2% and 26.8%, respectively, and 38.8% of the participants had at least one disease, and they were more likely to have low handgrip strength and low arm muscle quality (AMQ), and the longer the chronic diseases duration, the higher the risk. The ORs (95%CIs) for low handgrip strength and low AMQ in patients with 1 chronic disease for more than 10 years was 1.64 (1.42-1.90) and 1.83 (1.60-2.10), respectively. The ORs (95%CIs) for low handgrip strength were 1.26 (1.17-1.37), 1.42 (1.23-1.64) and 2.27 (1.55-3.32) and the ORs (95%CIs) for low AMQ were 1.28 (1.18-1.38), 1.67 (1.46-1.92) and 2.41(1.69-3.45), respectively, in patients with 1, 2, ≥3 chronic diseases, the correlation showed a linear trend (P for trend <0.001).

Discriminating Power of Centrality Measures in Complex Networks,"['Qi Bao', 'Zhongzhi Zhang']","Centrality metrics are one of the most fundamental tools in social network analysis and network science, and various measures for evaluating node importance metrics have been devised. However, the crucial issue of testing the discriminating power of different centrality measures is still open. In this article, we propose to assess the discriminating power of node centrality measures by using the notion of automorphism and orbit: nodes in the same orbit have identical metric scores, while nodes in different orbits should have different centrality values. Under this assumption, we present a benchmark for the discriminating power of node centrality measures. Moreover, we propose an efficient approach to evaluate centrality measures in terms of the discriminating power, which is devoid of finding orbits. Extensive experiments on real and model networks are executed to compare seven commonly used node centrality metrics.",Article,1.0, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,,0,"

Evolution of the hinterlands of eight Chinese ports exporting to europe under the Polar Silk Road: Three hypothetical scenarios,"['Yan Peng', 'Zhenfu Li', 'Wei Duan[...]', 'Qi Bao']","In July 2017, Russia formally offered an invitation to build the Polar Silk Road (PSR) to China. Then, the White Paper of China's Arctic Policy was officially published in January 2018. It proposes the joint construction of the PSR to promote sustainable economic and social development in the Arctic region. Notably, the PSR aims to open up China's maritime trade route through the Arctic to Northwest Europe and influence the container hinterland pattern of China's coastal ports. This study assumes three scenarios to analyse and predict the evolution of the hinterlands of Chinese ports exporting to Europe under the PSR. The discrete selection model based on random utility is constructed to divide the dominant hinterland, probabilistic hinterland and major competitive hinterland of ports. The research shows that the cost and time, container throughput and risk have negative effects on a shipper's choice of port, whereas the sailing frequency has a positive effect. In general, the hinterlands of northern ports continue to expand under the PSR. Meanwhile, the hinterlands of the middle ports decrease first and then increase, and those of the southern ports contract. Overall, the northern ports are the most vulnerable to the changes of PSR attributes.",Article,1.0, Ocean & Coastal Management,,0,"

Benchmark for Discriminating Power of Edge Centrality Metrics,"['Qi Bao', 'Wanyue Xu', 'Zhongzhi Zhang']","Edge centrality has found wide applications in various aspects. Many edge centrality metrics have been proposed, but the crucial issue that how good the discriminating power of a metric is, with respect to other measures, is still open. In this paper, we address the question about the benchmark of the discriminating power of edge centrality metrics. We first use the automorphism concept to define equivalent edges, based on which we introduce a benchmark for the discriminating power of edge centrality measures and develop a fast approach to compare the discriminating power of different measures. According to the benchmark, for a desirable measure, equivalent edges have identical metric scores, while inequivalent edges possess different scores. However, we show that even in a toy graph, inequivalent edges cannot be discriminated by three existing edge centrality metrics. We then present a novel edge centrality metric called forest centrality (FC). Extensive experiments on real-world networks and model networks indicate that FC has better discriminating power than three existing edge centrality metrics.",Article,1.0, The Computer Journal,Sep 18,0,"

Descriptive analysis of fracture hospitalization rate in adults from 10 regions of China,"['Z W Shen', 'Wei Yuxia', 'C Q Yu[...]', 'Lin Li']","Objective: To analyze the epidemiological distributions of fracture hospitalization. Methods: The present study included participants who participated in the baseline survey of China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) and excluded participants who were lost to follow up or died before 2009, leaving a total of 506 004 participants. Negative binomial regression models were used to analyze the epidemiological distribution of any fracture and fracture at five specific body sites (upperlimb, lowerlimb, spine, pelvis and hip) from 2009 to 2016 in 10 regions. Results: During a median follow-up of (7.7±1.2) years (total person-years 3 899 814), we documented 17 118 cases of fracture hospitalizations. The crude fracture hospitalization rate was 4.39/1 000 person-years. After controlling for the increasing age of the fixed cohort, the hospitalization rates of fractures at various body sites increased from 2009 to 2016, with an annual growth rate (95%CI) of 9.1% (8.3%-9.9%) for any fracture. The fracture hospitalization rate was higher in rural than in urban areas except for hip fractures (P<0.05) and the hospitalization rate of any fracture were 5.42/1 000 and 3.24/1 000 person-years in rural and urban areas, respectively. Fracture hospitalization rate increased by age. In participants aged <50 years, men had higher fracture hospitalization rates than women except for pelvis fracture, while in those aged ≥50 years, women had higher fracture hospitalization rates than men. Conclusions: Fracture hospitalization rates increased by age and also showed upward selular trends. As China has begun the aging process, fractures impose a heavier burden on society. It is of great significance to prevent osteoporosis-related and injury-related

Here, a telomerase‐responsive DNA‐icosahedron was designed to precisely release caged platinum‐nanodrugs into cisplatin‐resistance tumor cells for effective therapy. This DNA‐icosahedron was constructed by two pyramidal DNA cages connected with telomerase primers and telomeric repeats, while platinum‐nanodrugs were encapsulated into this DNA‐icosahedron. The presence of telomerase will elongate the primers, leading to the inner chain substitution of DNA‐icosahedron and subsequent releasing of caged nanodrugs. Results demonstrated this DNA‐icosahedron could precisely release caged nanodrugs in response to telomerase in tumor cells, exhibit enhanced anticancer efficacy to chemo‐resistance carcinoma and reduce toxicity to normal organs.

"Novel Fractional Wavelet Packet Transform: Theory, Implementation, and Applications","['Jun Shi', 'Xiaoping Liu', 'Wei Xiang[...]', 'Qinyu Zhang']","The fractional wavelet transform (FRWT), which generalizes the classical wavelet transform and the well-known fractional Fourier transform, has recently been demonstrated as a powerful analytical tool for signal and image processing. However, this transform suffers from a relatively poor resolution in the high fractional frequency region, which results in difficulties in discriminating signals containing close high fractional frequency components. A simple but effective method to overcome this deficiency is the fractional wavelet packet transform (FRWPT). There exist several different definitions of the FRWPT in the literature. Unfortunately, these existing definitions do not generalize well the classical results for the conventional wavelet packet transform. The objective of this paper is to obtain a novel FRWPT that preserves the properties of its conventional counterpart. We first define the novel FRWPT and then discuss its related properties. Fractional wavelet packet subspaces are also constructed. Moreover, a recursive algorithm for implementing the proposed FRWPT is presented. Finally, we discuss potential applications of the proposed FRWPT.",Article,0.0, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,,0,"

Verapamil enhances the antiproliferative effect of chemotherapeutic reagents and inhibits tumor growth of chemoresistant side population in pancreatic cancer,"['Liang Zhao', 'Y Zhao', 'Bettina Schwarz-Mörtl[...]', 'AG Bruns']","Introduction: Verapamil is an L-type calcium channel blocker and has been used in the treatment of hypertension, angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, and most recently, cluster headaches. Increasing evidence shows that Verapamil is able to enhance the cytotoxic effect of certain chemotherapies and reverse multidrug resistance by competitively inhibiting drug transport through P-glycoprotein. The side population (SP) is a small subtype of tumor cells with stem-like properties which could substantially be blocked by verapamil. In this study, we focus on the therapeutic potential of verapamil on stem-like SP cells and its positive effect as a chemotherapy promoter in pancreatic cancer. Material and methods: From the highly metastatic pancreatic cancer cell line L3.6pl a gemcitabine resistant variant (L3.6plGem) was developed and further validated by IC-50 determination. Hoechst33342 staining was used to detect the SP proportion in both sensitive and resistant L3.6pl cells. Proliferation assays, clonogenic assays, migration assays and apoptosis assays were performed in the presence of verapamil alone and combined with gemcitabine treatment. SP cells sorted from L3.6plGem were implanted orthotopically in nude mice and treated with verapamil by daily i.p injections. Results: After continuous treatment with gemcitabine, the IC50 of L3.6plGem significantly increased from 6.11ng/ml±0.93 to 119.77ng/ml±5.12 (p<1E-9). In parallel, the percentage of SP cells rose from 0.9%±0.22 to 5.38%±0.99 (p<5E-17). Verapamil treatment inhibited cell proliferation in both sensitive and resistant cells and increased chemosensitivity to gemcitabine.

Multidimensional entanglement transport through single-mode fiber,"['Jun Liu', 'Isaac Nape', 'Qainke Wang[...]', 'Andrew Forbes']","The global quantum network requires the distribution of entangled states over long distances, with substantial advances already demonstrated using polarization. While Hilbert spaces with higher dimensionality, e.g., spatial modes of light, allow higher information capacity per photon, such spatial mode entanglement transport requires custom multimode fiber and is limited by decoherence-induced mode coupling. Here, we circumvent this by transporting multidimensional entangled states down conventional single-mode fiber (SMF). By entangling the spin-orbit degrees of freedom of a biphoton pair, passing the polarization (spin) photon down the SMF while accessing multiple orbital angular momentum (orbital) subspaces with the other, we realize multidimensional entanglement transport. We show high-fidelity hybrid entanglement preservation down 250 m SMF across multiple 2 × 2 dimensions, confirmed by quantum state tomography, Bell violation measures, and a quantum eraser scheme. This work offers an alternative approach to spatial mode entanglement transport that facilitates deployment in legacy networks across conventional fiber.",Article,0.0, Science Advances,,1,"

Synergistic ferroptosis and macrophage re-polarization using engineering exosome-mimic M1 nanovesicles for cancer metastasis suppression,"['Ping Li', 'Mengqiu Gao', 'Zijian Hu[...]', 'Yueqing Gu']","Ferroptosis has been proved effective in cancer metastasis treatment, while the lack of internal ferric aggregation and sufficient catalysis at desired sites astrict the further therapeutic applications. Herein, M1 macrophages engineered with up-regulated CCR2 expression are employed as Fe3O4 nanoparticles carrier. Modified macrophages are further extruded into exosome-mimic nanovesicles (denoted as CCR2(+)-Fe-M1-Nvs) for preferential delivery. Compared with M1-derived exosomes, CCR2(+)-Fe-M1-Nvs exhibit favorable modification and production efficiency, and can be obtained in large quantity. Moreover, correlative in vivo and in vitro measurements find that CCR2(+)-Fe-M1-Nvs are recruited in the metastatic lesion through CCR2-CCL2 axis which is analogous to mature macrophages. Delivered Fe3O4 nanoparticles and M1-related factors (e.g·H2O2) serve as catalyzer of Fenton Reaction and facilitate ferroptosis in tumor, which collectively induce macrophages re-polarization thereby provoke tumor-specific immune response. Such nano-Fenton reactor as well as M2 nano-repolarizer are proved cooperatively efficient in already formed lung metastasis mice model and shed lights on the exploration of synergistic strategies for cancer metastasis management.",Article,1.0, Chemical Engineering Journal,,0,"

This chapter provides a general discussion of the key tenets related to modelling complex systems, followed by a review of the current state of the art in the simulation modelling of migration. The subsequent focus of the discussion on the key principles for modelling migration processes, and the context in which they occur, allows for identifying the main knowledge gaps in the existing approaches and for providing practical advice for modellers.

Galectin-1 induces invasion and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human gastric cancer cells via non-canonical activation of the hedgehog signaling pathway,"['Yang Chong', 'Dong Tang', 'Jun Gao[...]', 'Daorong Wang']","Galectin-1 (Gal-1) has been reported to be an independent prognostic indicator of poor survival in gastric cancer and overexpression of Gal-1 enhances the invasiveness of gastric cancer cells. However, the downstream mechanisms by which Gal-1 promotes invasion remains unclear. Moreover, the function of Gal-1 in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in gastric cancer has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we observed Gal-1 expression was upregulated and positively associated with metastasis and EMT markers in 162 human gastric cancer tissue specimens. In vitro studies showed Gal-1 induced invasion, the EMT phenotype and activated the non-canonical hedgehog (Hh) pathway in gastric cancer cell lines. Furthermore, our data revealed that Gal-1 modulated the non-canonical Hh pathway by increasing the transcription of glioma-associated oncogene-1 (Gli-1) via a Smoothened (SMO)-independent manner, and that upregulation of Gal-1 was strongly associated with gastric cancer metastasis. We conclude that Gal-1 promotes invasion and the EMT in gastric cancer cells via activation of the non-canonical Hh pathway, suggesting Gal-1 could represent a promising therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of gastric cancer metastasis.",Article,6.0, Oncotarget,,1,"

"Efficacy of Perioperative Intercostal Analgesia via a Multimodal Analgesic Regimen for Chronic Post-Thoracotomy Pain During Postoperative Follow-Up: A Big-Data, Intelligence Platform-Based Analysis","['Yijin Yu', 'Lingyan Cui', 'Lu Qian[...]', 'Junran Xie']","Background: Chronic post-thoracotomy pain is still an obstacle for lung-cancer patients even after less invasive surgical procedures. It is unclear whether intercostal analgesia is as useful in the prevention of postoperative chronic pain as it is for acute pain for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of perioperative intercostal analgesia for chronic pain via a multimodal analgesic regimen for VATS during 6 months of postoperative follow-up. Methods: We identified 837 cases of VATS from August 2016 to August 2018. Patients were treated by perioperative intercostal analgesia with 0.75% ropivacaine 50 mg through the intercostal catheter every 8 hours until chest tube extubation (INA group) or conventional analgesia with preoperative 0.75% ropivacaine 50 mg at incision once (CON group). Numerical rating scale (NRS) and neuropathic pain were evaluated in 6 months of post-surgery follow-up. Postoperative adverse effects were recorded. Results: In total, there were 419 patients in INA group and 418 patients in CON group. Scores of NRS with motion was lower in INA group at 3 postoperative days (P = 0.032). Occurrence of chronic pain was 28.4% in INA group and 32.8% in CON group at 6 postoperative months, 10.6% of patients experienced increasing pain from 3 to 6 months. Occurrence of considerable neuropathic pain (ID pain score ≥ 2) was 2.1% in INA group and 3.1% in CON group at 6 postoperative months. No differences were found between the two groups. Occurrence of numbness was lower in INA group (6.7% vs 10.5%, P = 0.031), and other pain symptoms did not differ between the groups.

An effective biphase system accelerates hesperidinase-catalyzed conversion of rutin to isoquercitrin,"['Jun Wang', 'An Gong', 'Cai-Feng Yang[...]', 'Fu-An Wu']","Isoquercitrin is a rare, natural ingredient with several biological activities that is a key precursor for the synthesis of enzymatically modified isoquercitrin (EMIQ). The enzymatic production of isoquercitrin from rutin catalyzed by hesperidinase is feasible; however, the bioprocess is hindered by low substrate concentration and a long reaction time. Thus, a novel biphase system consisting of [Bmim][BF4]:glycine-sodium hydroxide (pH 9) (10:90, v/v) and glyceryl triacetate (1:1, v/v) was initially established for isoquercitrin production. The biotransformation product was identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the bonding mechanism of the enzyme and substrate was inferred using circular dichroism spectra and kinetic parameters. The highest rutin conversion of 99.5% and isoquercitrin yield of 93.9% were obtained after 3 h. The reaction route is environmentally benign and mild, and the biphase system could be reused. The substrate concentration was increased 2.6-fold, the reaction time was reduced to three tenths the original time. The three-dimensional structure of hesperidinase was changed in the biphase system, which α-helix and random content were reduced and β-sheet content was increased. Thus, the developed biphase system can effectively strengthen the hesperidinase-catalyzed synthesis of isoquercitrin with high yield.",Article,5.0, Scientific Reports,,1,"

Polygenic risk score in personalized screening of lung cancer: a prospective cohort study in Chinese,"['M Zhu', 'Jinghui Lyu', 'C Q Yu[...]', 'Lin Li']","Objective: To explore how to personalize lung cancer screening programs for prevention in Chinese populations based on individual genetic risk score. Methods: We constructed the lung cancer polygenic genetic risk score (PRS-19) based on the 19 previously published genetic variations, using 100 615 participants with genotyping data from the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB). Using the 5-year absolute risk of lung cancer in a population (55 years old with at least 30-pack-year history of smoking) as reference, the trend of 5-year absolute risk in different genetic risk groups was calculated in smokers and non-smokers, respectively. Distribution curves of 5-year absolute risk were also described to determine the theoretical age or smoking dose when different genetic risk groups reached the reference values. Given the overall findings, the specific start age for lung cancer screening were suggested for different genetic risk groups. Results: The 5-year absolute risk of lung cancer was 0.67% in 55-year-old smokers with 30 packs per year in the CKB. Among smokers, 5-year absolute risk of participants increased as the genetic risk increased. Hence, it was recommended that people at high genetic risk should start screening earlier. For the highest genetic risk populations (the top 1% of PRS), the start age might be changed to 50 years old. If the start age remained at 55-year-old, the smoking dose should be set lowered in high genetic risk populations. For the highest genetic risk populations, they should be included in lung cancer screening regardless of the cumulative smoking exposure. Among nonsmokers, it was also valuable to screen people with high genetic risk, considering the start age of 62 for the highest genetic risk populatio

Methods: Data of 23 615 participants from the second resurvey of the China Kadoore Biobank (CKB) was used. Fried phenotype was constructed using five phenotypes, and frailty indexes (FI) were constructed using 28 and 40 deficits, respectively. We calculated the Weighted Kappa coefficient to compare the consistency of three measures in the classification of frailty status. Cox regression was performed to analyze the association of frailty status with risk of mortality. Results: The frailty prevalence calculated by Fried phenotype, FI-28, and FI-40 were 5.4%, 7.9%, and 4.0%, respectively. The Kappa coefficients of Fried phenotype with FI-28 and FI-40 were 0.357 and 0.408, respectively. The Kappa coefficients of FI-28 and FI-40 was 0.712. During an average of (3.9±0.5) years of follow-up, 755 participants died. When Fried phenotype was used, compared with the robust participants, the prefrail and frail participants had increased risk of mortality, the multivariable-adjusted HRs were 1.60 (95%CI: 1.32-1.94) and 2.90 (95%CI: 2.25-3.73), respectively. When FI-28 was used, the corresponding HRs were 1.71 (95%CI: 1.39-2.11) and 2.52 (95%CI:1.95-3.27) for prefrail and frail participants, and when FI-40 was used, the corresponding HRs were 1.98 (95%CI:1.60-2.44) and 3.71 (95%CI: 2.80-4.91).

Nrf2 is Essential for Timely M-phase Entry of Replicating Hepatocytes during Liver Regeneration.,"['Yuhong Zou', 'Min Hu', 'Joonyong Lee[...]', 'Guoli Dai']","Transcription factor Nrf2 regulates various cellular activities including the redox balance, detoxification, metabolism, autophagy, proliferation and apoptosis. A few studies demonstrate that Nrf2 regulates hepatocyte proliferation during liver regeneration. The aim of the study was to gain insight into how Nrf2 modulates the cell cycle of replicating hepatocytes in regenerating livers. Wild-type and Nrf2-null mice were subjected to 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PH) and sacrificed at multiple time points for various analyses. Nrf2-null mice exhibited sluggish liver regrowth, although the lost liver mass was eventually restored seven days after PH. Nrf2 deficiency did not affect the number of hepatocytes entering the cell cycle, but rather caused a delay in hepatocyte mitosis. Mechanistically, the lack of Nrf2 resulted in increased mRNA and protein levels of hepatic Cyclin A2 when remaining hepatocytes were replicating in response to PH. Moreover, in regenerating livers, Nrf2 deficiency caused dysregulation of Wee1, Cdc2, and Cyclin B1 in their mRNA and protein expression, leading to decreased activity of Cdc2. Nrf2 is required for timely M phase entry of replicating hepatocytes by ensuring proper regulation of Cyclin A2 and the Wee1/Cdc2/Cyclin B1 pathway during live regeneration.

Associations of lifestyles with major chronic diseases in Chinese adults: evidence from the China Kadoorie Biobank,"['Yuanjie Pang', 'C Q Yu', 'Yugui Guo[...]', 'Lin Li']","Major chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and respiratory disease, cause substantial mortality and morbidity in China. Evidence from Western population showed that smoking, excessive alcohol intake, physical inactivity, unhealthful dietary habits and adiposity are independent risk factors for major chronic diseases. However, because of the vast differences in lifestyles and disease patterns, evidence from Western populations may not be generalizable to the Chinese population. Assessing the directions and magnitude of associations between lifestyles and major chronic diseases is crucial to evaluate the benefits yielded from lifestyle modifications, thus informing related guidelines. In recent years, prospective cohort studies in China, including the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB), have shown relationships between unfavorable lifestyle factors and major chronic diseases. In particular, the CKB study has laid the evidence base for lifestyle factors (occupational physical activity) and diseases (hemorrhagic stroke, gastrointestinal cancers, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) unique to the Chinese population.

The effect of computerisation on the wage share in United Kingdom workplaces,['Nicola Pensiero'],"This historical paper analyses the distributional consequences of computerisation on the wage share of income in United Kingdom (UK) workplaces in the first decade of this century. The reasons why computerisation might increase a firm’s income but reduce the share assigned to wages are still not well understood. The uniquely rich Workplace Employment Relations Survey (WERS) 2004–2011 includes firm-level measures of the main production inputs and outputs, and thus allows an analysis of the main mechanisms through which increased computer usage influenced the wage share of income in UK workplaces over this period. This analysis shows that the proportion of employees using computers impacted the wage share in ways that were at odds with two mainstream views: that computers complement capital, and that labour can be easily replaced by capital. The results show that the proportion of employees using computers reduced the wage share by disproportionally increasing the productivity of the least skilled employees, who were not proportionally compensated for their increase in productivity. The stability of the wage share, over the period of interest, is explained by the rise in a workplace’s share of professional employees and by a rise in work effort. This positive contribution to the wage share was counteracted by an increased share of employees using computers and by a reduction in the share of employees whose pay was negotiated by unions, thereby contributing to a decline in the wage share of firm income.

Experimental UK regional consumer price inflation with model‐based expenditure weights,"['James Dawber', 'Nora Würz', 'Paul A. Smith[...]', 'Nikolaos Tzavidis']","Like many other countries, the UK produces a national consumer price index (CPI) to measure inflation. Presently, CPI measures are not produced for regions within the UK. It is believed that, using only available data sources, a regional CPI would not be precise or reliable enough as an official statistic, primarily because the regional partitioning of the data makes sample sizes too small. We investigate this claim by producing experimental regional CPIs using publicly available price data, and deriving expenditure weights from the Living Costs and Food survey. We detail the methods and challenges of developing a regional CPI and evaluate its reliability. We then assess whether model-based methods such as smoothing and small area estimation significantly improve the measures. We find that a regional CPI can be produced with available data sources, however it appears to be excessively volatile over time, mainly due to the weights. Smoothing and small area estimation improve the reliability of the regional CPI series to some extent but they remain too volatile for regional policy use. This research provides a valuable framework for the development of a more viable regional CPI measure for the UK in the future.",Article,1.0, Journal of Official Statistics,,0,"

"Antisense inhibition of microRNA-21 and microRNA-221 in tumor-initiating stem-like cells modulates tumorigenesis, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance in pancreatic cancer","['Yue Zhao', 'Lu Zhao', 'Ivan Ischenko[...]', 'Peter Camaj']","Our preliminary studies identified a small population side population (SP) cells in pancreatic cancer cells with stem cell-like properties, which were able to induce fast and aggressive tumor formation in nude mice. Gene expression analysis showed a significant difference in the expression of more than 1,300 genes in SP cells, among which a highly significant difference in microRNA expression of miR-21 and miR-221 between SP and NSP cells was identified. SP cells were identified and characterized by flow cytometry using Hoechst 33342 dye staining from a highly metastatic human pancreatic cancer cell line (L3.6pl). Antagomir transfection was performed using miRNA-21 and miRNA-221 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and followed by detection of cell apoptosis, cell cycle progression, chemosensitivity, and invasion. Sorted SP cells from gemcitabine-resistant L3.6pl cells (L3.6plGres-SP) cells were orthotopically implanted in nude mice with or without miRNA-21 and miRNA-221 ASOs mono- and combination therapy. The administration of antagomir-21 and antagomir-221 significantly reduced the SP cell fraction, decreased SP cell differentiation, and downstream gene regulation, and thereby induced reduction of L3.6pl cell proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance against gemcitabine and 5-Fluorouracil. Combination of ASOs therapy against miRNA-21 and miRNA-221 significantly inhibited primary tumor growth and metastasis compared to single antagomir treatment, especially, in L3.6plGres-SP-induced pancreatic tumor growth in vivo. These findings further indicate that the inhibition of miR-21 and miR-221 appear particularly suitable to target stem-like subpopulations and address their specific biological function to prom

Transport Systems Conferring Pathogenicity to Escherichia coli,['Fengyi Tang'],"Escherichia coli K12 are currently the best-understood organism on Earth; a larger fraction of its genes have been functionally characterized than for any other organisms. However, organisms given this species designation are extremely diverse, genetically and phenotypically. E. coli proves to be a valuable model system for understanding bacterial physiology, metabolism, genetics and pathogenesis. Why has E. coli been so much more extensively studied than any other bacterium on Earth? It all began with the German pediatrician and bacteriologist, Theodor Escherich, who was dismayed to find that so many babies were dying of diarrhea diseases. In fact, we now know that E. coli is one of the top causes of infant mortality, adult diarrhea and urinary tract infections worldwide. It was because of the organism's broad host specificity and ability to cause many different diseases in large numbers of animals, including humans, that it was first selected as an important bacterium for study. More recently, it has been found that certain strains of E. coli are probiotic, having beneficial effects on host animals, counteracting the detrimental consequences of their pathogenic counterparts. Genetic analyses have revealed that the tremendous phenotypic diversity of the hundreds of currently recognized E. coli strains resulted from the frequent occurrence of horizontal gene transfer during the evolutionary divergence of the Escherichia genus. In fact, the pan genome of E. coli far exceeds the core genome, by up to 20-fold or more. Thus E. coli should not be thought of as an entity or species; it represents an entire spectrum of related organisms sharing only the core housekeeping genes.",Article,4.0, Journal of Medical Microbiology & Diagnosis,,0,"

The number of offline and online lessons per day increased and this led to a larger volume of schoolwork being done, from 2.3 hours per day to 3.3 hours per day in primary schools, and from 2.6 hours per day to 4 hours per day in secondary schools. •The increase in schoolwork provision can be explained by the improved provision of lessons, by greater availability of computers and by the fact that families were better prepared for the second school closure and could engage more with the schoolwork provided. •The results show that in January 2021 the gaps between ‘service class’ students (students whose parents are large employers, higher managers and professionals) and ‘routine class’ students (students whose parents are in routine and semi-routine sales, service, technical, agricultural and clerical occupations) reduced and became non-significant for primary school pupils.

Methodologies of extraction: The mining techniques in the Early Neolithic flint mines of Southern England and their continental origins,['Jon Baczkowski'],"Recent research on the chronology of the Early Neolithic (4000-3500 BC) in Southern England has shown that flint mines are amongst the earliest monuments to appear in the landscape. This paper will outline the findings from research into extraction methodologies at the mines of Southern England. It is proposed that these methods are also observable in the flint mines of Northwest Europe. It is also argued that at present there is no evidence of a chronological development from proto-mines to deep flint mines in Southern England. To support this hypothesis the unpublished excavation of the only known Neolithic drift mines in Southern England, on Harrow Hill, West Sussex, will be investigated. Finally, a review of the radiocarbon dates of Southern English flint mines is undertaken, which places these significant monuments into a chronological model and further demonstrates a link to their continental counterparts.

Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify the hub genes related to hypoxic adaptation in yak (Bos grunniens),"['Qi Bao', 'Xiaolan Zhang', 'Pengjia Bao[...]', 'pl Yan']","Background As a mammal living at the highest altitude in the world, the yak has strong adaptability to the harsh natural environment (such as low temperature, scarce food, especially low oxygen) of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) after a long process of natural selection.Objective Here, we used Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA), a systematic biology method, to identify hypoxic adaptation-related modules and hub genes. The research of the adaptability of yak against hypoxia is of great significance to identify the genetic characteristics and yak breeding.Methods Based on the transcriptome sequencing data (PRJNA362606), the R package DESeq2 and WGCNA were conducted to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and construct the gene co-expression network. The module hub genes were identified and characterized by the correlation of gene and trait, module membership (kME). In addition, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were used to explore the functions of hub genes.ResultsOur results revealed that 1098, 1429, and 1645 DEGs were identified in muscle, spleen, and lung, respectively. Besides, a total of 13 gene co-expression modules were detected, of which two hypoxic adaptation-related modules (saddlebrown and turquoise) were found. We identified 39 and 150 hub genes in these two modules. Functional enrichment analyses showed that 12 GO terms and 18 KEGG pathways were enriched in the saddlebrown module while 85 GO terms and 22 KEGG pathways were enriched in the turquoise module.

Effect of vacancy defects on the thermal conductivity of graphene nanoribbons: A molecular dynamics study,"['Xiao-Liang Wang', 'Fangwei Xie', 'Liqiang Zhang[...]', 'Ping Yang']","The reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (RNEMD) has been performed to compute the thermal conductivity of armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRS) affected by vacancy defects. One- and two-atom vacancy defects are observed on the thermal conductivity of AGNRS. We find that one-atom vacancy defects can decrease the thermal conductivity significantly. Two-atom vacancy defects are located along the axial direction of AGNRS, and the thermal conductivity drops with the number of atoms between two-atom vacancies defects increasing. When two-atom vacancy defects are located along the longitudinal direction of AGNRS, the reduction of the thermal conductivity of AGNRS shows a pan shape.",Article,2.0, International Journal of Materials and Structural Integrity,,0,"

FFnet: Residual Block-Based Convolutional Neural Network for Crowd Counting,"['Fei Lei', 'Qinyu Zhang', 'Peng Zhao[...]', 'Xiao Han']","Due to the nonuniform scale variations and severe occlusion, most current state-of-the-art approaches use multicolumn CNN architectures with different receptive fields to tackle these obstacles. We design a single-column network to verify the necessity of multicolumn network, and we find that under similar number of parameters and size of receptive field, single network is able to perform as well as multicolumn network. Following that, we propose a single-column network called FFnet based on residual block. FFnet is a fully convolutional network and easy to train. We perform extensive experiments on Shanghaitech dataset and the UCF_CC_50 dataset, and the results show that our method achieves a better performance than Switch-CNN with nearly half number of parameters, and a closing performance to the state-of-the-art model CP-CNN with almost one-tenth parameters.",Chapter,,,Apr 15,0,"

Identification of deliberate catheter motion at the left atrial posterior wall during pulmonary vein isolation: Validity of respiratory motion adjustment,"['David R Tomlinson', 'Katie Biscombe', 'John True[...]', 'Adam J Streeter']","Background During automated radiofrequency (RF) annotation‐guided pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), respiratory motion adjustment (RMA) is recommended, yet lacks in vivo validation. Methods Following contact force (CF) PVI (continuous RF, 30W) using general anaesthesia and automated RF annotation‐guidance (VISITAG™: force‐over‐time 100% minimum 1g; 2mm position stability; ACCURESP™ RMA “off”) in 25 patients, we retrospectively examined RMA settings “on” versus “off” at the left atrial posterior wall (LAPW). Results Respiratory motion detection occurred in 8, permitting offline retrospective comparison of RMA settings. Significant differences in LAPW RF auto‐annotation occurred according to RMA setting, with curves displaying catheter position, CF and impedance data indicating “best‐fit” for catheter motion detection using RMA “off”. Comparing RMA “on” versus “off”, respectively: Total annotated sites 82 versus 98; median RF duration per‐site 13.3s versus 10.6s (p<0.0001); median force time integral 177g.s versus 130g.s (p=0.0002); mean inter‐tag distance (ITD) 6.0mm versus 4.8mm (p=0.002). Considering LAPW annotated site 1‐to‐2 transitions resulting from deliberate catheter movement, 3 concurrent with inadvertent 0g CF demonstrated <0.6s difference in RF duration. However, 13 deliberate catheter movements during constant tissue contact (ITD range 2.1 – 7.0mm) demonstrated (mean) site‐1 RF duration difference 3.7s (range: ‐1.3 to 11.3s): considering multiple measures of catheter position instability, the appropriate indication of deliberate catheter motion occurred with RMA “off” in all.

Flexible generation conversion and exchange of fiber guided orbital angular momentum modes using helical gratings,"['Liang Fang', 'Jian Wang']","By exploiting helical gratings (HGs), we propose and simulate flexible generation, conversion and exchange of fiber guided orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes. HGs can enable the generation of OAM modes, and the OAM conversion between two arbitrary modes guided in fibers. A specific HG can exchange the OAM states of a couple of OAM modes, i.e, OAM exchange. In addition, a Fabry Perot cavity cascaded with two identical reflective HGs can reflect converted OAM modes with a comb spectrum. The HGs based generation conversion and exchange of OAM modes are dependent on helix period, orientation, and the fold number of helical fringes. The proposed method of generation, conversion, and exchange of fiber guided OAM modes using HGs is flexible and well compatible with OAM fibers, featuring a high conversion efficiency close to 100% and a conversion bandwidth about 10 nm in transmission spectra, while less than 1 nm in reflection spectra.",Preprint,,,,0,"

Effect of Intraoperative Ventilation Strategies on Postoperative Pulmonary Complications: A Meta-Analysis,"['Min Lei', 'Qi Bao', 'Huanyu Luo[...]', 'Junran Xie']","Introduction: The role of intraoperative ventilation strategies in subjects undergoing surgery is still contested. This meta-analysis study was performed to assess the relationship between the low tidal volumes strategy and conventional mechanical ventilation in subjects undergoing surgery. Methods: A systematic literature search up to December 2020 was performed in OVID, Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Google scholar, and 28 studies including 11,846 subjects undergoing surgery at baseline and reporting a total of 2,638 receiving the low tidal volumes strategy and 3,632 receiving conventional mechanical ventilation, were found recording relationships between low tidal volumes strategy and conventional mechanical ventilation in subjects undergoing surgery. Odds ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated between the low tidal volumes strategy vs. conventional mechanical ventilation using dichotomous and continuous methods with a random or fixed-effect model. Results: The low tidal volumes strategy during surgery was significantly related to a lower rate of postoperative pulmonary complications (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.44–0.83, p < 0.001), aspiration pneumonitis (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46–0.86, p < 0.001), and pleural effusion (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56–0.92, p < 0.001) compared to conventional mechanical ventilation. However, the low tidal volumes strategy during surgery was not significantly correlated with length of hospital stay (MD, −0.48; 95% CI, −0.99–0.02, p = 0.06), short-term mortality (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.70–1.10, p = 0.25), atelectasis (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.57–1.01, p = 0.06), acute respiratory distress (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.67–1.66, p = 0.81), pneumothora

Using multi-site substitution to design blue-exciting phosphor Mg2Y2Al2Si2O12:Mn2+ for full-spectrum plant growth LEDs,"['Zhipeng Wang', 'Panlai Li', 'JinjinLiu[...]', 'Zhijun Wang']","Full-spectrum plant growth light emitting diode (LED) prepared using a variety of phosphors has some problems, such as energy loss and spectral distortion. It is the solution that designing a kind of phosphor, which is the single activated ion doped phosphor with the multiple emission. To achieve this goal, the host Mg2Y2Al2Si2O12 (Abbreviated as: MYASO) was selected from a large number of garnet materials which has the multi-sites, and the Mn²⁺ was selected as the activated ion which can produce the different emission in the different crystal field. The results show that Mn²⁺ can produce the green light (536nm), red light (635nm) and deep red light (735 nm), which correspond to the Mn²⁺ substituting for the tetra-coordinated Al³⁺, the octa-coordinated Mg²⁺ and the hexa-coordinated Mg²⁺, respectively, importantly, this phosphor can be efficiently excited by the 456nm blue light, which matches well with the blue LED chip.

A Trajectory Optimization-Based Intersection Coordination Framework for Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles,"['Yixiao Zhang', 'Rui Hao', 'Tingting Zhang[...]', 'Qinyu Zhang']","Since vehicles from multiple roads frequently merge at intersections, it formulates a typical traffic bottleneck of modern transportation systems. Proper vehicle coordination and motion plan at road intersections are of importance to guarantee safety as well as improving the traffic throughput, fuel efficiency and so on. In this paper, we try to present a general dedicated intersection coordination framework for autonomous vehicles, where both high- and low-level planners are appropriately designed and integrated. In the high-level planner, two different strategies are formulated to coordinate the autonomous vehicles to generate reference trajectories and feasible ""tunnels"", respectively. Especially, a novel space-time-block based resource allocation scheme is presented to describe the feasible tunnels.

Using data from Understanding Society, the UK Household Longitudinal Study, we estimate that loss to be more pronounced for children from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds than for other children. In April 2020, one month into the COVID-19 lockdown: - Children in primary schools spent on average 2.4 hours per day doing schoolwork (compromising on average 2.2 offline lessons - a mix of worksheets, assignments and watching videos – and 0.6 online lessons) plus 2 hours per day of support from adults. - Children in secondary schools spent on average 3 hours per day doing schoolwork (compromising on average 2.3 offline lessons and 1 online lesson) plus 0.9 hours per day of support from adults. - Focusing on combinations of circumstances which are both common and policy relevant (see graphs), we found that children in the most advantaged families, where both parents work regularly from home, the main parent[1] is in a ‘service class’ occupation (large employers, managers of professionals) and the children have their own computer spent on average 2.9 hours per day on school work for primary and 3.8 per day for secondary pupils. More disadvantaged children in families where the main parent is not in a service class occupation, where the child has to share a computer with other family members and either parent does not work regularly from home, the hours spent per day on school work are 2.3 for primary and 2.6 for secondary education.

Methods: Detailed information regarding passive smoking behaviors related to 317 486 non-smokers who were 30-79 years old from the 10 study regions were gathered and analyzed. Results: Following the standardization of the 2010 China national population, the prevalence rate of passive smoking was 56.7%, and the prevalence rate of living with smokers was 66.5% among the Chinese adults. Both of the aforementioned rates were higher in rural than in urban areas. Meanwhile, the regional distribution of weekly passive smoking frequency and cumulative duration of passive smoking per week and cumulative duration of passive smoking per day were significantly different. The cumulative passive smoking duration per week increased along with the weekly frequency in people living in urban areas. Among women, the weekly passive smoking frequency was the highest, and the cumulative durations per week and per day appeared the lowest in Hunan, opposite to the situation in Henan. The prevalence of passive smoking among participants living with smokers was 2.27 times (95%CI: 2.24-2.29) of those who were not and the association appeared stronger in women (OR=2.61, 95%CI: 2.58-2.64) but not in men (OR=1.01, 95%CI: 0.95-1.06). Almost all the indicators seemed higher in women than those in men, except for the cumulative duration per day.

A label-free lead(II) ion sensor based on surface plasmon resonance and DNAzyme-gold nanoparticle conjugates,"['Huanan Wu', 'Shuokang Wang', 'Sam Fong Yau Li[...]', 'Qiyong Xu']","Detection of lead(II) (Pb2+) ions in water is important for the protection of human health and environment. The growing demand for onsite detection still faces challenges for sensitive and easy-to-use methods. In this work, a novel surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor based on GR-5 DNAzyme and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was developed. Thiolated DNAzyme was immobilized on the gold surface of the sensor chip followed by anchoring the substrate-functionalized AuNPs through the DNAzyme-substrate hybridization. The coupling between the localized surface plasmon (LSP) of AuNPs and the surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) on the gold sensor surface was used to improve the sensitivity. The substrate cleavage in the presence of Pb2+ ions was catalyzed by DNAzyme, leading to the removal of AuNPs and the diminished LSP-SPP coupling. The optimal detection limit was 80 pM for the sensor fabricated with 1 μM DNAzyme, corresponding to two or three orders of magnitude lower than the toxicity levels of Pb2+ in drinking water defined by WHO and USEPA. By tuning the surface coverage of DNAzyme, the sensitivity and dynamic range could be controlled. This sensor also featured high selectivity to Pb2+ ions and simple detection procedure. Successful detection of Pb2+ ions in groundwater indicates that this method has the prospect in the onsite detection of Pb2+ ions in water. Given the variety of AuNPs and metal-specific DNAzymes, this detection strategy would lead to the development of more sensitive and versatile heavy metal sensors.

Study on Detecting Dielectric Properties of Typical Electrical Insulation Materials by Terahertz Wave Spectroscopy,"['Hongwei Mei', 'Lanxin Li', 'Fanghui Yin[...]', 'Liming Wang']","The dielectric properties of the electrical insulation materials is of great importance to the safe operation of the power system. As a promising technique in the field of material testing and with the very adaptive physical modeling of wave transmission process, terahertz wave was used to measure the dielectric properties of five commonly used insulation materials by two methods in this paper. When excluding the echo pulse from the reference signal and the sample signal, a better signal-noise ratio and a wider effective frequency band of spectrums can be obtained. Alternatively, the dielectric properties can also be achieved by separating the main pulse and echo pulse from the sample signal. The latter method makes the sampling of reference signal unnecessary. Furthermore, the dielectric properties of materials were also measured on a relative lower frequency band (1Hz-1MHz) by the broadband dielectric spectrometer. Compared with a relatively lower frequency band, due to the polarization, the dielectric constant of the tested insulation materials was lower on the terahertz band while the dielectric loss tangent was generally higher except the epoxy resin.",Article,0.0, IEEE Access,"Dec 31, 2020",1,"

Joint Oligopoly-Oligopsony Model with Wage Markdown Power,"['Jian Tong', 'Carmine Ornaghi']","In imperfectly competitive markets, a producer-employer firm can be considered monopolist-monopsonist, facing downward sloping residual demand for product and upward sloping residual supply for labour, and can thereby exercise both product price markup and wage markdown powers. To study market outcomes in this setting, we define a Joint Oligopoly-Oligopsony Model (JOOM) - an extended Cournot oligopoly model with imperfectly competitive labour market - and derive its Cournot-Nash equilibrium, featuring the relationship between market structure and market power, price and wage, output and employment, and investigate its welfare implications. We also extend the partial equilibrium welfare analysis to include Worker Surplus. By elevating Worker Surplus on a par with Consumer Surplus as suitable welfare standards, the JOOM makes apparent the potentially efficiency-enhancing function of labour union and minimum wage regulation, aimed at curbing oligopsony wage markdown power. We show that a lax merger control, which permits consolidation of market structure, can weaken the worker power in the form of reducing efficient minimum wage, as well as employment. Furthermore, we use the JOOM theory to investigate the effect of superstar firms on market outcomes. We show that the superstar firm hypothesis can explain the rise of average labour productivity, the fall of labour income share and wage stagnation at the industry level: all stylised facts consistent with the empirical findings of Autor et al (2020). Our analysis shows that the superstar firm phenomenon can have an ambiguous welfare effect once we take worker welfare into consideration.",Research,,,,1,"

Athenian ideology in Demosthenes’ deliberative oratory: hailing the dēmos,['Sarah Bremner'],"This thesis examines Demosthenes’ rhetorical use of Athenian ideology in his deliberative speeches from 351-341 BCE. I argue that during this period of crisis, which is usually narrated in terms of conflict with Macedonia, Demosthenes confronts an internal crisis within the Assembly. While Demosthenes’ deliberative speeches have traditionally been defined as ‘Philippic’, this thesis argues that the speeches do not prioritise an ‘Anti- Macedonian’ agenda, but rather focus on confronting the corruption of the deliberative decision-making process. Due to an attitude of apathy and neglect, Demosthenes’ rhetoric suggests that their external problems are a direct product of this internal crisis, both of which are perpetuated by their failure to recognise how self-sabotaging practices undermine the polis from within. As he asserts in On the Chersonese and the Third Philippic, they cannot hope to deal with their external situation before they deal with their internal crisis. To address this, I argue that Demosthenes’ parrhēsia interweaves criticism of the dēmos with the praise of Athens, using social memory and past exempla both to recall and prescribe didactically the attitudes central to Athenian identity. As such, I propose that the deliberative speeches do not confront a ‘Macedonian Question’, but a fundamentally Athenian one.

Methods: A total of 32 725 twin pairs aged 18 years and above who completed the questionnaire survey during 2010-2018 and had complete registered information in CNTR and normal body weight and length were included in the analysis on the population and region specific distributions of BMI of twin pairs and the difference in BMI in twin pairs. Results: The twin pairs included in the analysis were aged (34.6±12.4) years, the twin pairs of same gender accounted for 79.7%. The average BMI was 22.5 kg/m2. The overall prevalence of obesity and overweight was 4.9% and 23.7%, respectively. Participants who were men, 50-59 years old, married, had lower education level, and lived in northern China had higher overweight rate and obesity rate (P<0.001). The difference in overweight or obesity prevalence between monozygotic (MZ) twin pars and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs was not significant, but firstborn twin pairs had slightly higher rates of overweight and obesity than later-born twin pairs (P<0.05). The analysis in same gender-twin pairs indicated that the difference in BMI was associated with age (trend test: P<0.001), and the difference was more obvious in DZ twin pair in MZ pair and this difference increased with age.

Platelet‐Mimicking Therapeutic System for Noninvasive Mitigation of the Progression of Atherosclerotic Plaques,"['Yi Ma', 'Yuxuan Ma', 'Mengqiu Gao[...]', 'Yi Liu']","Atherosclerotic plaque is the primary cause of cardiovascular disorders and remains a therapeutic hurdle for the early intervention of atherosclerosis. Traditional clinical strategies are often limited by surgery‐related complications or unsatisfactory effects of long‐term drug administration. Inspired by the plaque‐binding ability of platelets, a biomimic photodynamic therapeutic system is designed to mitigate the progression of atherosclerotic plaques. This system is composed of photosensitizer‐loaded upconversion nanoparticle cores entrapped in the platelet membrane. The platelet membrane coating facilitates specific targeting of the therapeutic system to macrophage‐derived foam cells, the hallmark, and main component of early stage atherosclerotic plaques, which is firmly confirmed by in vivo fluorescent and single‐photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) radionuclide imaging. Importantly, in vivo phototherapy guided by SPECT/CT imaging alleviates plaque progression. Further immunofluorescence analysis reveals foam cell apoptosis and ameliorated inflammation. This biomimic system, which combines plaque‐binding with radionuclide imaging guidance, is a novel, noninvasive, and potent strategy to mitigate the progression of atherosclerotic plaque.",Article,1.0, Advanced Science,Feb 18,1,"

Gene-body mass index interaction on coronary heart disease in Chinese adult twins,"['Y E Xi', 'W J Gao', 'Jinghui Lyu[...]', 'Lin Li']","Objective: To explore the gene-body mass index (BMI) interaction on coronary heart disease (CHD) in the Chinese adult twins. Methods: A total of 20 340 same-sex twin pairs registered in the Chinese National Twin Registry (CNTR) were enrolled in this study. Classical twin structure equation model was used to estimate the gene-BMI interaction on CHD. Results: After adjusting for age, we found that genetic variance of CHD differed as the function of BMI in male twins, which indicated the presence of a gene-BMI interaction on CHD (P=0.008).The genetic moderating effect (βa) was -0.14 (95%CI: -0.22--0.04), indicating that for each logarithmic transformation value of BMI increase, genetic path parameters would decrease by 0.14, which would result in the decrease of genetic variance of CHD. And the heritability of CHD was 0.77 (95%CI: 0.65-0.86) among the male twins with lower BMI (<24.0 kg/m2), but 0.56 (95%CI: 0.33-0.74) among the male twins with high BMI (≥24.0 kg/m2). However, there was no evidence suggesting that BMI could moderate genetic variants of CHD in female. Conclusion: We found a significant gene-BMI interaction on CHD in the Chinese male adult twins in China, and the heritability of CHD was higher among the twins whose BMI was <24.0 kg/m2.",Article,1.0, Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,,0,"

Bayesian Model-Based Approach: Impact on Science and Policy,"['Jakub Bijak', 'Martin Hinsch', 'Sarah Nurse[...]', 'Oliver Reinhardt']","In this chapter, we summarise the scientific and policy implications of the Bayesian model-based approach, starting from an evaluation of its possible advantages, limitations, and potential to influence further scientific developments, policy and practice. We focus here specifically on the role of limits of knowledge and reducible (epistemic), as well as irreducible (aleatory) uncertainty. To that end, we also reflect on the scientific risk-benefit trade-offs of applying the proposed approaches. We discuss the usefulness of proposed methods for policy, exploring a variety of uses, from scenario analysis, to foresight studies, stress testing and early warnings, as well as contingency planning, illustrated with examples generated by the Risk and Rumours models presented earlier in this book. We conclude the chapter by providing several practical recommendations for the potential users of our approach, including a blueprint for producing and assessing the impact of policy interventions in various parts of the social system being modelled.",Chapter,,,,0,"

A multi-omics approach to investigate the etiology of non-communicable diseases: recent advance and applications,"['Yuanjie Pang', 'Jinghui Lyu', 'C Q Yu[...]', 'L M Li']","One of the main aims of chronic disease epidemiology is to explore the etiological factors of diseases. Multi-omics includes all genes (genomics), extensive changes in gene expression (epigenetics), ribonucleic acids (transcriptomics), and proteins (proteomics) generated during the process of DNA replication, transcription, translation, and post-translational modification, as well as small molecule metabolites downstream (metabolomics). Multi-omics platforms provide technical support for assessing omics biomarkers including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, while systems epidemiology provides theoretical and methodological support for using multi-omics to conduct etiological research. Multi-omics research not only reveals the interaction network between molecules, but also contributes to causal inference from the molecular level. With the global exponential growth of publicly available data, analysis platforms, and consortia, resources for multi-omics research will become more abundant, and the depth and breadth of research will be greatly expanded. This article will review the applications of multi-omics approach in the etiologic research on non-communicable diseases, representative research in the past three years, opportunities and challenges for large-scale cohort studies, advantages and issues of multi-omics research in the Chinese population, and future perspectives.",Article,1.0, Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,,0,"

White-Collar Cybercrime: Evaluating the Redefinition of a Criminological Artifact,['Christopher Hamerton'],"This paper explores the cause and effect of cybercrime from the perspective of what has been termed white-collar cybercrime, providing a layered analysis of established theoretical models and typologies and evaluating these to determine where white-collar cybercrime might fit within the evolving discipline of cybercriminology and wider interdisciplinary social sphere. White-collar crime itself offers the rare example of a criminological theory that has the attributes of an artifact - establishing a distinct criminal offence type within law and criminal justice and entering mainstream knowledge and terminology within half a century of inception. Despite this, white-collar cybercrime is a relatively new concept for cyber criminological analysis and is currently a rarity within the academic literature. Thus, the piece primarily seeks to compliment and expand recent scholarship in offering further critical evaluation of an important emergent model. This is done in terms of its history, evolution, characteristics, position within social change theory, and via examination of some of the many policy, practice and security challenges that appear inherent to the modern networked workplace.",Article,0.0, Journal of Law and Criminal Justice,,0,"

gwasfilter: an R script to filter genome-wide association study,"['S C Yang', 'C Y Li', 'Y Z Hu[...]', 'Lin Li']","Objective: To develop an R script that can efficiently and accurately filter genome-wide association studies (GWASs) from the GWAS Catalog Website. Methods: The selection principles of GWASs were established based on previous studies. The process of manual filtering in the GWAS Catalog was abstracted as standard algorithms. The R script (gwasfilter.R) was written by two programmers and tested many times. Results: It takes six steps for gwasfilter.R to filter GWASs. There are five main self-defined functions among this R script. GWASs can be filtered based on ""whether the GWAS has been replicated"" ""sample size"" ""ethnicity of the study population"" and other conditions. It takes no more than 1 second for this script to filter GWASs of a single trait. Conclusions: This R script (gwasfilter.R) is user-friendly and provides an efficient and standard process to filter GWASs flexibly. The source code is available at github (https://github.com/lab319/gwas_filter).",Article,1.0, Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,,0,"

Study of etiology and esophageal motility characteristics of esophagogastric junction outlet obstruction patients,"['K Wang', 'Z J Xu', 'Yurong Ge[...]', 'L P Duan']","Objective: To analyze the causes of the esophagogastric junction outlet obstruction (EGJOO) patients, to discuss the differences of the clinical manifestation and esophageal motility characteristics between the anatomic EGJOO (A-EGJOO) and functional EGJOO (F-EGJOO) subgroups, and to search the diagnostic values of the specific metrics for differentiating the subgroups of EGJOO patients. Methods: For the current retrospective study, all the patients who underwent the esophageal high resonance manometry test were retrospectively analyzed from Jan 2012 to Oct 2018 in Peking University Third Hospital. The EGJOO patients were enrolled in the following research. The clinical characteristics, such as symptoms and causes of the patients were studied. Then the patients were divided into two subgroups as A-EGJOO subgroup and F-EGJOO subgroup. The clinical symptoms and the main manometry metrics were compared between these two subgroups. The significant different metrics between the two groups were selected to draw receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the diagnostic values were analyzed in differentiating the A-EGJOO and F-EGJOO subgroups. Results: The most common symptom of EGJOO was chest pain or chest discomfort (30.63%), then the dysphagia (29.73%), and acid regurgitation/heartburn (27.03%). Non-erosive reflux disease (36.04%) was the most popular cause for EGJOO, then the reflux esophagitis (17.12%). Besides the intra-EGJOO and extra-EGJOO lesions, the connective tissue disease (6.31%) and central nervous diseases (2.70%) were found to be the etiology of EGJOO. The causes of the rest 19 EGJOO were unknown. A-EGJOO patients presented significantly

Modification of physical activity on genetic effects of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a twin pairs cohort study in China,"['S J Chen', 'W J Gao', 'Jinghui Lyu[...]', 'Lin Li']","Objective: To explore the modification effect of physical activity on the genetic effects of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: The univariate moderation model was fitted to calculate the modifying effect of physical activity on the genetic effects of T2DM based on the data of 12 107 pairs of same gender twins aged 30 years and older enrolled by the Chinese National Twin Registry in 11 provinces/cities in China. Results: After adjusting for age and gender, the heritability of T2DM was 0.56 (0.31-0.84). Qualified physical activity could attenuate the genetic effects of T2DM. The heritability of T2DM in twin pairs with qualified physical activity was 0.46 (0.06-0.88), which was lower than that in twin pairs without qualified physical activity during the same model [0.68(0.36-0.94)]. Conclusion: T2DM is a moderate genetic disease, physical activity can modify the genetic effects of T2DM.",Article,1.0, Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,,0,"

Chinese herbal medicine Tangshen Formula treatment for type 2 diabetic kidney disease in the early stage: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"['De Jin', 'Wen-Jing Huang', 'Xiang Meng[...]', 'Xiao-Lin Tong']","Background: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the main cause of end-stage kidney disease and has become a heavy economic and social burden due to its high prevalence and morbidity. The most effective strategy is that patients with DKD should be diagnosed and treated early. Preliminary studies showed that the Chinese herbal Tangshen Formula (TSF) may delay the progression of DKD, reducing microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria and improving renal function. We designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of TSF in patients with DKD. Methods/design: This trial is a 13-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 632 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an experiment group (TSF plus losartan) and a control group (placebo plus losartan). The trial cycle will last 24 weeks. The primary outcome will be the change in the urine microalbumin-creatinine ratio from baseline to week 24. The secondary outcome will be the change in the rate of progression to the clinical proteinuria period after intervention, the rate of urine microalbumin negative conversion, the rate of normal urinary microalbumin, the doubling rate of the baseline creatinine value and the glomerular filtration rate between the two groups. Safety in medication will also be evaluated. Discussion: We hypothesize that patients with type 2 diabetes in the early stage of DKD will benefit from TSF. If successful, this study will provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03009864. Registered January 2017.",Article,9.0, Trials,,1,"

Detection of Small Defects in Composite Insulators Using Terahertz Technique and Deconvolution Method,"['Hongwei Mei', 'Huaiyuan Jiang', 'Fanghui Yin[...]', 'Liming Wang']","After a long-term operation, defects may occur in the composite insulators and threat the safe operation of the power transmission. To secure the power transmission system, it would be beneficial to detect the defects in their initial stage. In this paper, the terahertz technique combined with a deconvolution method was proposed, and a terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system was built. To validate the method proposed, three types of defects, namely single air gap defect, inclusion defect, and double-layer air gap defect were artificially prepared and tested. According to the test results, it was found that, compared with the traditional terahertz method, the air gap size that could lead to pulse overlapping was reduced from 1.22 mm to 0.57 mm. After the deconvolution process, air gap defect as small as 0.173 mm could be distinguished due to the shape characteristics of unipolar pulse. It was also found that when the defect was damp, the obtained waveform near the defect became smooth. The results of the present study demonstrate that terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS), combined with the deconvolution method, can have high potential in the detection of defects in composite insulators.",Article,0.0, IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,,1,"

"Prevalence, patterns and long-term changes of multimorbidity in adults from 10 regions of China","['Z J Sun', 'J N Fan', 'C Q Yu[...]', 'Lin Li']","Objective: To describe the prevalence of multimorbidity and its secular trend, and to explore the common patterns of multimorbidity in Chinese adults. Methods: A total of 25 033 participants who attended the second resurvey of China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) were included in the study. We used data collected both at baseline (2004-2008) and at resurvey (2013-2014). A total of 13 chronic conditions were included, defined by self-reported, physical examination, and blood sample testing. Multimorbidity was defined as co-existence of two or more chronic conditions. Patterns of multimorbidity were explored using hierarchical cluster analysis. Results: The mean age of participants was (51.5±10.1) years at baseline and (59.5±10.2) years at second resurvey. The prevalence of multimorbidity increased from 33.5% to 58.1% over (8.0±0.8) years of follow-up. The average number of chronic conditions per person increased from 1.15 to 1.82 and all participants increased 0.42 conditions per 5 years on average. Participants who were older, less educated or lived in urban areas had a higher prevalence of multimorbidity and a higher increase in the number of chronic conditions. The increase in the number of chronic conditions was also higher among smokers and heavy alcohol drinkers. The most common multimorbidity pattern in the present population consisted of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and heart disease. Conclusions: The prevalence of multimorbidity in Chinese adults is increasing rapidly due to ageing population. Populations of different sociodemographic background and lifestyle habits may have different prevalence of multimorbidity and changes in rates over time.",Article,1.0, Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,,0,"

All-fiber polarization-manageable directional couplers,"['Liang Fang', 'Jian Wang']","Flexible management of light polarization is necessary to develop the technologies of optical fiber communications. However, it is still a great challenge to manipulate optical polarization in all-fiberbased devices. Here we present a novel structural design of three-core fiber couplers to create arbitrary polarization management by embedding a vector mode segregated core within the conventional fiber couplers. We take advantages of these coupling structures to achieve polarization split, rotation, and exchange, as three essential polarization managements for fiber-guided modes. We study these couplers based on coupled-mode theory and numerically simulations. The obtained results show that they manifest favorable operation performance on management of the fiber modal polarization states. Compared to previous couplers used for management of power, wavelengths and modal forms, this kind of fiber couplers introduces a new manageable degree of freedom for modal polarization. It is expected that the presented all-fiber polarization-manageable directional couplers might find potential applications in fiber optical communications and sensing systems.",Preprint,,,,0,"

"Breaking Chalk: the archaeological investigation of early neolithic flint mines at Long Down and Harrow Hill, West Sussex, 1984-86. The Sussex Archaeological Collections 2017. Vol. 155, 1-30.","['Robin Holgate', 'Jon Baczkowski']","Fieldwork undertaken between October 1984 and September 1986 at four of the six neolithic flint mining sites in West Sussex recorded the remains of shafts, drift mines and flintworking areas adjacent to the mines. Sample excavations at two of these sites, Long Down and Harrow Hill, revealed that ploughing had truncated nearly all the surviving remains in those areas under cultivation. The flintwork, pottery and organic material retrieved from the excavations provided information on the flint artefacts produced at these sites, and fragments of possibly carinated pottery, together with radiocarbon dating, proved that mining took place at Long Down in the early neolithic period (4000–3500 BC). The discovery of drift mines at Harrow Hill is significant, as they are the only open-cast or drift mines to have been investigated at a prehistoric flint mining site in southern England.
