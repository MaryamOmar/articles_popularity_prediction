The data-driven personalisation of insurance,['Liz Mcfall'],"ABSTRACT Are data-driven techniques ‘personalising’ insurance? The application of new techniques over the last decade has been welcomed in some quarters as a means of disrupting an unpopular industry. In other quarters, disruption is seen as a threat to the solidaristic, risk-spreading principles underlying socialised and, to a lesser extent, privatised insurance models. If risk is to be determined by the behaviour of individuals rather than their membership of pools, this has far-reaching implications for how fairness and non-discrimination are defined and regulated in insurance practice. Yet public debate on the topic has been hampered by confusion over what is meant by ‘personalisation’ and by limited understanding of the role existing insurtech innovations play in assessing risk. To clarify these issues the paper reviews two recent and controversial cases– the use of self-tracking in ‘interactive’ health and life insurance and the use of customer-facing AI by Lemonade Inc. a non-life US based insurtech company.",Conference Paper,,,4d ago,0,"

Performance evaluation of hybrid routing protocols against network layer attacks in MANET,"['Apoorva Chandra', 'Sanjeev Thakur']","This paper simulates and evaluates the performance of zone routing protocol (ZRP), hybrid wireless mesh protocol (HWMP) and adhoc on demand distance vector protocol (AODV) against black hole, gray hole and jellyfish reordering attacks which inversely affect the functionality of protocols. Although for MANET numerous protocols and improvised algorithms has never been tested against each other on numerous network layer attacks. The performance evaluation done has quantitatively represented facts for use of specific routing protocol. For fast and secure transmission of data for network scenario those protocols are used who acquire structural change of network scenario. Mobile nodes are open to security attacks as due to their changing network structure and open communication channel.

Corporate Social Responsibility in the Development of China’s Rural Education: A Case Study of Two Counties in Anhui Province,"['Jingbo Hua', 'Natalie Wong']","This research paper took new stakeholder businesses in Tongcheng and Huaining, two cities in Anhui Province, China, as cases for a comparative study to analyse the role of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in supporting education in China’s rural areas. The research primarily used interviews with subjects from the local education bureau, rural schools and related corporations. The study suggests that CSR has promoted rural education in Tongcheng and Huaining through various channels, including foundations, local NGOs, government agencies and direct involvement. However, most CSR involvement is highly vulnerable, owing to the lack of institutionalization and formalization of CSR behaviour. Additionally, the inappropriate administrative practices of governments and unreliable channels of distribution of funds are impediments to CSR. The study demonstrates that CSR is a rapidly developing concept in China, with strong untapped potential to improve rural education if current obstacles can be removed.",Article,0 , China An International Journal,5d ago,1,"

‘You just prefer to die early!’: how socioecological context impedes treatment for people living with HIV in Iran,"['Vira Ameli', 'Leila Taj', 'Jane Barlow[...]', 'Minoo Mohraz']","Introduction Despite the low prevalence of HIV and broad provision of antiretroviral therapy, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) remains the only region where new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths are not declining. There is a dearth of evidence from MENA on antiretroviral therapy engagement. In this qualitative study, we sought to identify the ways in which successful treatment is hindered in Iran, which is home to 24% of HIV infections in MENA. Methods From August 2018 to January 2019, we used purposive sampling and conducted 12 individual interviews and 8 focus group discussions with 27 female and 31 male patients, in addition to 5 individual interviews with HIV care providers and 1 focus group discussion with 8 care providers. Social constructivism augmented with realist-informed thematic analysis was used to understand how the socioecological context triggers cognitive and affective mechanisms that disrupt antiretroviral therapy. Results The use of Thematic Network Analysis resulted in the identification of three key cognitive and affective mechanisms that appear to shape treatment experience and are triggered via HIV’s socioecological context and changing economic conditions in Iran: denial in response to societal negative perceptions of HIV; fear in response to societal lack of awareness regarding HIV and misinformation; and despair in response to HIV-related stigma and enacted discrimination, economic insecurity and social support. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study within MENA to identify pathways through which successful treatment is hindered. It appears that lack of societal awareness regarding HIV is specific to low prevalence settings, such as MENA countries, where nega

What roles for viruses in origin of life scenarios?,['Gladys Kostyrka'],"Important roles in origin of life (OL) scenarios have been and still are attributed to viruses. Yet the strict dependence of viruses on cells for their multiplication has been widely acknowledged since the first decades of the 20th century. How could viruses play critical roles in the OL if life relies on cellular organization and if viruses are defined as parasites of cells? In other words, how could viruses play a role in the emergence of cellular life if the existence of cells is a prerequisite for the existence of viruses? This paper investigates this issue and describes past and current OL scenarios conferring viruses with important roles, thereby completing the work of historian of science and physician Scott Podolsky who identified three major roles of viruses in past OL scenarios. Some objections raised by present OL scenarios conferring viruses with an important role are discussed. I argue that disagreements concerning the roles of viruses in OL scenarios stem from the different concepts of life and of virus scientists defend. Investigating the roles of viruses in OL scenarios not only helps identifying different ways to define life in the context of OL theorizing. It also offers the opportunity to better understand how viruses could be conceptualized. The relevance of the replication-first versus metabolism-first dichotomy in OL theorizing is briefly discussed.",Article,6 , Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences,6d ago,1,"

From obstacle to lynchpin: the evolution of the role of bacteriophage lysogeny in defining and understanding viruses,"['Gladys Kostyrka', 'Neeraja Sankaran']","The phenomenon of bacteriophage lysogeny has played a vital role in understanding the nature of viruses more generally. Discovered in 1920, the phenomenon was first wielded by its discoverers as a challenge to the idea that bacteriophages might be autonomous infectious agents of exogenous origin, namely viruses. But by the 1950s, lysogeny had come to be understood as a key mechanism through which some bacteriophages interacted with their bacterial hosts. In this paper we consider the history of the status of bacteriophage lysogeny from obstacle to lynchpin in conceiving of viruses, paying particular attention to the contributions of Eugène and Élisabeth Wollman, Macfarlane Burnet and André Lwoff in effecting this transition. As Lwoff is often acknowledged to be the author of the ‘modern’ virus concept, this paper also retraces the precise experimental, theoretical and technical pathways that led him and his collaborators from their studies of lysogeny to the construction of the said concept. We discuss Lwoff's virus concept and the widening impact of his ideas, with special consideration of how lysogeny helped revolutionise the understanding virus–host-cell relationships in tumour viruses.",Article,0 , Notes and Records of The Royal Society,,0,"

"Zooming in on risk- Insurtech, big data and the business of disruption",['Liz Mcfall'],"Abstract: Purpose-built insurance architecture was once commissioned to convey messages of strength, solidity and mythological antiquity and reproduced as corporate graphic identities in print paraphernalia from letterhead to advertisements and souvenir calendars. But is there more at play in insurance architecture than promotional strategy and if architecture has a promotional role, who are the targeted audiences? This paper explores the changing relationship between insurance buildings, insurance brands, and capital and property investment strategies. It considers how the business of property investment propelled the work of big insurers in shaping urban environments through the twentieth century and traces how that began to change as the century closed. The ascendance of the tech industries and the emergence of ‘insurtech’ has been accompanied by a change in the role architecture plays in insurance. Architecture, and interior design, still play a central role in branding but insurtech start-ups, and the insurtech branches of legacy insurers, use it to convey lightness, agility, creativity and informality. These changes line up with a signature big tech aesthetic – more valley, less city – that is designed to evoke innovation and disruption. This is a narrative that is targeted at investors as much as consumers.",Preprint,,,7d ago,0,"

Accelerating Sustainable Development Goals for South African adolescents from high HIV prevalence areas a longitudinal path analysis,"['Franziska Meinck', 'Frederick Orkin', 'Lucie Cluver']","Background Adolescents experience a multitude of vulnerabilities which need to be addressed in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In sub-Saharan Africa, adolescents experience high burden of HIV, violence exposure, poverty, and poor mental and physical health. This study aimed to identify interventions and circumstances associated with three or more targets (“accelerators”) within multiple SDGs relating to HIV-affected adolescents and examine cumulative effects on outcomes. Methods Prospective longitudinal data from 3401 adolescents from randomly selected census enumeration areas in two provinces with > 30% HIV prevalence carried out in 2010/11 and 2011/12 were used to examine six hypothesized accelerators (positive parenting, parental monitoring, free schooling, teacher support, food sufficiency and HIV-negative/asymptomatic caregiver) targeting twelve outcomes across four SDGs, using a multivariate (multiple outcome) path model with correlated outcomes controlling for outcome at baseline and socio-demographics. The study corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing and tested measurement invariance across sex. Percentage predicted probabilities of occurrence of the outcome in the presence of the significant accelerators were also calculated. Results Sample mean age was 13.7 years at baseline, 56.6% were female. Positive parenting, parental monitoring, food sufficiency and AIDS-free caregiver were variously associated with reductions on ten outcomes. The model was gender invariant. AIDS-free caregiver was associated with the largest reductions. Combinations of accelerators resulted in a percentage reduction of risk of up to 40%. Conclusion Positive parenting, parental mo

Exploring the willingness to adopt rapid diagnostic tests to improve antimicrobial medicine use amongst Tanzanian livestock farmers,"['Vera Florida Mugittu', 'Henry Buller', 'Ann Bruce']","This article deals with the challenge of addressing antimicrobial resistance in resource-poor countries. It explores the possibilities of using rapid diagnostic tests to improve animal health management and treatment, particularly in situations where laboratory veterinary infrastructure is limited. Using data from a survey undertaken in 2018, three composite variables, i.e. perceived usefulness, compatibility with existing practices and ease of use, derived from the Model of Technological Acceptance and Diffusion Innovation Theory are used to analyse the perceived characteristics and values of rapid diagnostic test devices for farmers. Results suggest smallholder farmers’ willingness to adopt and use the tests provided they are affordable, easy to use and suitable to their local conditions – a common referential being mobile phones. While such tests have the potential to improve how antibiotics are used in smallholder farms, they are more likely to instigate more general improvements in how treatment decisions are made without necessarily reducing unnecessary antimicrobial use. The adoption may also imply a diminishing need for traditional veterinary services, thus making farmers more self-sufficient in animal health care. Farmers also seem to be more concerned by false negatives leading to sick animals missing vital treatment than by false positives where drugs will be administered to healthy animals. Overall promoting rapid diagnostic test technologies inevitably calls for new controls and regulations.",Article,1 , International Journal of Technology Management and Sustainable Development,Nov 10,0,"

IR theory and Area Studies: a plea for displaced knowledge about international politics,"['Katarzyna Kaczmarska', 'Stefanie Ortmann']","This article critically engages with the hierarchical binary between theory and area research in the study of international politics. We pose questions about the processes which construct and reaffirm the theory/area distinction in IR and show that the binary creates structural pressures and reinscribes hierarchies for individual scholars. We notice that IR’s Euro/West-centrism is directly linked to and perpetuated by the divide that privileges IR theorising over empirical research both on and from places outside of the West. We show how this divide has been institutionalised with the effect of producing separate but intertwined academic fields of ‘IR’ and ‘Area Studies’. The hitherto voiced calls to overcome the divide have largely focused on the question of how to give more weight to knowledge produced about the ‘non-West’ in IR. This, we argue, overlooks the broader significance of the theory/area divide, which lies in the socio-instructional structures maintaining it and the concrete effects they have on researchers from the ‘peripheries’. This article, therefore, aims to examine the construction of Area Studies’ peripherality and to rethink possible solutions. To better illustrate the intersection of epistemic politics and political economy of knowledge production, we highlight the experience of researchers from the Global East.",Article,1 , Journal of International Relations and Development,Nov 5,0,"

Populism as an act of storytelling: analyzing the climate change narratives of Donald Trump and Greta Thunberg as populist truth-tellers,"['Johan Nordensvard', 'Markus Ketola']","We propose that populism is a storytelling performance that involves a charismatic ‘truth-teller’ and a populist narrative frame. Populist narratives are sensemaking devices that guide people in areas of contestation, uncertainty and complexity where decisions cannot solely rely on rational and formal processes. Populist ‘truth-tellers’ apply a particular narrative frame that pits ‘people’ against the ‘elite’ when interpreting complex problems such as climate change. The aim of this article is one of theory generating, using the cases of Donald Trump and Greta Thunberg to illustrate the idea of populism as story-telling. While their climate change stories are very different, both share an approach that relies on the ‘truth-telling’ character of their hero, applying the same populist narrative frame. These findings add to our understanding of the role emotions and conflicts play in the struggles to make sense of climate change based on particular interests or political agendas.",Article,1 , Environmental Politics,Nov 3,0,"

Learner pregnancy in South Africa’s Eastern Cape: The Factors affecting adolescent girls' school withdrawal during pregnancy,"['Janina Jochim', 'Lucie D.

However, few studies have investigated which factors affect adolescents’ school discontinuation during pregnancy. This study interviewed 1,046 adolescent mothers from the Eastern Cape province in South Africa. The results showed that a quarter of school-going adolescent girls withdrew from school during the pregnancy - many as early as the first trimester. School withdrawal was associated with higher poverty, higher grade repetition, an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy, and greater lack of information about the pregnancy. Given the high enrolment rates at the onset of the pregnancy, school-based services may provide an opportunity to identify which girls require substantial support to remain in education throughout pregnancy, using a history of poor school performance as an indicator for dropout.",Article,1 , International Journal of Educational Development,,1,"

Evolutionarily divergent mTOR remodels the translatome to drive rapid wound closure and regeneration,"['Olena Zhulyn', 'Hannah Dorothy Rosenblatt', 'Leila Shokat[...]', 'Maria Barna']","An outstanding mystery in biology is why some species, such as the axolotl, can scarlessly heal and regenerate tissues while most mammals cannot. Here, we demonstrate that rapid activation of protein synthesis is a unique, and previously uncharacterized, feature of the injury response critical for limb regeneration in the axolotl (A. mexicanum). By applying polysome sequencing, we identify hundreds of transcripts, including antioxidants and ribosome components, which do not change in their overall mRNA abundance but are selectively activated at the level of translation from pre-existing mRNAs in response to injury. In contrast, we show that protein synthesis is not activated in response to digit amputation in the non-regenerative mouse. We further identify the mTORC1 pathway as a key upstream signal that mediates this regenerative translation response in the axolotl. Inhibition of this pathway is sufficient to suppress translation and axolotl regeneration. Surprisingly, although mTOR is highly evolutionarily conserved, we discover unappreciated expansions in mTOR protein sequence among urodele amphibians. By engineering an axolotl mTOR in human cells, we demonstrate that this change creates a hypersensitive kinase that may allow axolotls to maintain this pathway in a highly labile state primed for rapid activation. This may underlie metabolic differences and nutrient sensing between regenerative and non-regenerative species that are key to regeneration. Together, these findings highlight the unanticipated impact of the translatome on orchestrating the early steps of wound healing in highly regenerative species and provide a missing link in our understanding of vertebrate reg

"On the design of linked datasets mapping networks of collaboration in the genomic sequencing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, and Sus scrofa","['Mark Wong', 'Rhodri Leng']","This paper describes a unique two-step methodology used to construct six linked bibliometric datasets covering the sequencing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Homo sapiens , and S us scrofa genomes. First, we retrieved all sequence submission data from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), including accession numbers associated with each species. Second, we used these accession numbers to construct queries to retrieve peer-reviewed scientific publications that first linked to these sequence lengths in the scientific literature. For each species, this resulted in two associated datasets: 1) A .csv file documenting the PMID of each article describing new sequences, all paper authors, all institutional affiliations of each author, countries of institution, year of first submission to the ENA, and the year of article publication, and 2) A .csv file documenting all institutions submitting to the ENA, number of nucleotides sequenced, number of submissions per institution in a given year, and years of submission to the database. In several upcoming publications, we utilise these datasets to understand how institutional collaboration shaped sequencing efforts, and to systematically identify important institutions and changes in network structures over time. This paper, therefore, should aid researchers who would like to use these data for future analyses by making the methodology that underpins it transparent. Further, by detailing our methodology, researchers may be able to utilise our approach to construct similar datasets in the future.",Article,0 , F 1000  Research,Oct 28,1,"

Diversity in citations to a single study: A citation context network analysis of how evidence from a prospective cohort study was cited,['Rhodri Leng'],"Between its origin in the 1950s and its endorsement by a consensus conference in 1984, the diet–heart hypothesis was the object of intense controversy. Paul et al. (1963) is a highly-cited prospective cohort study that reported findings inconvenient for this hypothesis, reporting no association between diet and heart disease; however, many other findings were also reported. By citation context and network analysis of 343 citing papers, I show how Paul et al. was cited in the twenty years after its publication. Generally, different findings were cited by different communities focussing on different risk-factors; communities established by either research foci title terms or via cluster membership as established via modularity maximisation. The most frequently cited findings were the significant associations between heart disease; and serum cholesterol (n=85), blood pressure (n=57), and coffee consumption (n=54). The lack of association between diet and heart disease was cited in just 41 papers. Yet, no single empirical finding was referred to in more than 25% of the citing papers. This raises questions about the value of inferring impact from citation counts alone, and raises problems for studies using such counts to measure citation bias.

We find that adolescents use a range of personal capitals (social, cultural, and economic) to access tobacco, with the specific constitution and deployment of these capitals varying according to the regularities of different fields. Since adolescents access tobacco via culturally embedded practices, attempts to curtail this access are more likely to be effective if they are multi-pronged, culturally informed, and attuned to the lived experiences of adolescent smokers.",Article,1 , Qualitative Health Research,Oct 26,0,"

The book offers an innovative perspective on how individual behavior is socially patterned. It draws in part on the massive recent explosion of self-help manuals, television shows, and internet sites designed to produce and sanction particular forms of behavior. It also taps into the enduring fascination with situations in which extreme and violent conduct is widespread.

Systems-level analysis of how flaviviruses hijack cellular processes through virus-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs) provides information about their replication and pathogenic mechanisms. We used affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to compare flavivirus-host interactions for two viruses (DENV and ZIKV) in two hosts (human and mosquito). Conserved virus-host PPIs revealed that the flavivirus NS5 protein suppresses interferon stimulated genes by inhibiting recruitment of the transcription complex PAF1C and that chemical modulation of SEC61 inhibits DENV and ZIKV replication in human and mosquito cells. Finally, we identified a ZIKV-specific interaction between NS4A and ANKLE2, a gene linked to hereditary microcephaly, and showed that ZIKV NS4A causes microcephaly in Drosophila in an ANKLE2-dependent manner. Thus, comparative flavivirus-host PPI mapping provides biological insights and, when coupled with in vivo models, can be used to unravel pathogenic mechanisms. Comparing protein-protein interactions across dengue and Zika viruses reveals both common mechanisms and functionally distinct pathways contributing to infection outcomes.",Article,8 , Cell,Oct 25,0,"

A p53-dependent translational program directs tissue-selective phenotypes in a model of ribosomopathies,"['Gerald Tiu', 'Craig H Kerr', 'Craig M.

What accounts for such tissue-selective manifestations as a result of mutations in the ribosome, a ubiquitous cellular machine, has remained a mystery. Combining mouse genetics and in vivo ribosome profiling, we observe limb-patterning phenotypes in ribosomal protein (RP) haploinsufficient embryos, and we uncover selective translational changes of transcripts that controlling limb development. Surprisingly, both loss of p53, which is activated by RP haploinsufficiency, and augmented protein synthesis rescue these phenotypes. These findings are explained by the finding that p53 functions as a master regulator of protein synthesis, at least in part, through transcriptional activation of 4E-BP1. 4E-BP1, a key translational regulator, in turn, facilitates selective changes in the translatome downstream of p53, and this thereby explains how RP haploinsufficiency may elicit specificity to gene expression.

Drawing on examples of both success and failure, contributors analyze specific cases to understand the kinds of institutions that emerge in response to demands for territorial pluralism, as well as their political effects.

I sought to collaborate with my co-researchers / co-authors through a community-based action (CBA) approach at Kakuma Refugee Camp to assure that their youthful (ages 18–35) voices were included in this study. A CBA approach seeks to speak with participants, not for them. They learned about the research process, why research is needed, and how we can produce it together. Using a critical-hope framework, that is, a pedagogical tool that uses a critical theory lens to address unjust systems through meaningful dialogue and empathic responses, we co-led 30 psychosocial peace-building education (PBBE) courses in Kakuma and Nairobi, Kenya. Data were collected from the researcher and co-researchers’ reflective logs on our own observations in the PBBE courses. A thematic analysis approach was chosen in order to avoid focusing on the norms and/or creating specific norms that dictate, demand conformity, and silence divergent voices. There were three themes: time, place, and person.",Chapter,,,Oct 20,0,"

An Exploratory Survey of Mental Health Social Work in Europe,"['Kevin Stone', 'Pearse Mccusker', 'Gavin Davidson', 'Sarah Vicary']","This article reports on an exploratory study comparing mental health social work (MHSW) in Europe. There has been very limited previous research comparing approaches to MHSW in Europe and so the aim of the study was to develop a better understanding of the similarities and differences between and, where relevant, within countries (referred to as jurisdictions). An online survey was distributed mainly through existing European networks and social media to seek information on the role, nature, extent and context of MHSW in a range of European jurisdictions. Conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, there were 158 responses from 10 jurisdictions. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. From this analysis, four main themes were identified, relating to: role; law, policy and education; the distinctive contribution made by MHSW; and the key challenges for MHSW. The study demonstrates that MHSW, although it is described and provided in different ways and is confined by a range of factors, plays an important role in mental health services across jurisdictions. There are also interesting differences between contexts, especially in the balance of therapeutic, legal and specialist/generic approaches, some of which reflect the World Health Organisation’s vision and objectives for mental health. Lastly, the study illustrates a need and provides a valuable basis for further comparative and collaborative work to define MHSW and enhance the contributions it makes.",Article,1 , International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,Oct 10,0,"

Using data-driven approaches to improve delivery of animal health care interventions for public health,"['Stella Mazeri', 'Jordana L. Burdon Bailey', 'Dagmar Mayer[...]', 'Richard J Mellanby']","Rabies kills ∼60,000 people per year. Annual vaccination of at least 70% of dogs has been shown to eliminate rabies in both human and canine populations. However, delivery of large-scale mass dog vaccination campaigns remains a challenge in many rabies-endemic countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, where the vast majority of dogs are owned, mass vaccination campaigns have typically depended on a combination of static point (SP) and door-to-door (D2D) approaches since SP-only campaigns often fail to achieve 70% vaccination coverage. However, D2D approaches are expensive, labor-intensive, and logistically challenging, raising the need to develop approaches that increase attendance at SPs. Here, we report a real-time, data-driven approach to improve efficiency of an urban dog vaccination campaign. Historically, we vaccinated ∼35,000 dogs in Blantyre city, Malawi, every year over a 20-d period each year using combined fixed SP (FSP) and D2D approaches. To enhance cost effectiveness, we used our historical vaccination dataset to define the barriers to FSP attendance. Guided by these insights, we redesigned our vaccination campaign by increasing the number of FSPs and eliminating the expensive and labor-intensive D2D component. Combined with roaming SPs, whose locations were defined through the real-time analysis of vaccination coverage data, this approach resulted in the vaccination of near-identical numbers of dogs in only 11 d. This approach has the potential to act as a template for successful and sustainable future urban SP-only dog vaccination campaigns.",Article,1 , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,Oct 8,1,"

Factors associated with mobile phone ownership and potential use for rabies vaccination campaigns in southern Malawi,"['Orla Marron', 'Gareth Thomas', 'Jordana L. Burdon Bailey[...]', 'Stella Mazeri']","Background: Rabies is a fatal but preventable viral disease, which causes an estimated 59 000 human deaths globally every year. The vast majority of human rabies cases are attributable to bites from infected domestic dogs and consequently control of rabies in the dog population through mass vaccination campaigns is considered the most effective method of eliminating the disease. Achieving the WHO target of 70% vaccination coverage has proven challenging in low-resource settings such as Sub Saharan Africa, and lack of public awareness about rabies vaccination campaigns is a major barrier to their success. In this study we surveyed communities in three districts in Southern Malawi to assess the extent of and socio-economic factors associated with mobile phone ownership and explore the attitudes of communities towards the use of short message service (SMS) to inform them of upcoming rabies vaccination clinics. Methods: This study was carried out between 1 October-3 December 2018 during the post-vaccination assessment of the annual dog rabies campaign in Blantyre, Zomba and Chiradzulu districts, Malawi. 1882 questionnaires were administered to households in 90 vaccination zones. The surveys gathered data on mobile phone ownership and use, and barriers to mobile phone access. A multivariable regression model was used to understand factors related to mobile phone ownership. Results: Most survey respondents owned or had use of a mobile phone, however there was evidence of an inequality of access, with higher education level, living in Blantyre district and being male positively associated with mobile phone ownership. The principal barrier to mobile phone ownership was the cost of the phone its

When do social democratic parties unite over tough immigration policy?,"['Philip Rathgeb', 'Fabio Wolkenstein']","Attempting to reconcile the diverse immigration policy demands of the ‘old’ working class and the ‘new’ middle class, social democratic parties struggle to take a clear position on immigration policy. Adopting more restrictive policies is a possible way forward, but this is likely to lead to electorally costly intra-party conflict. This article illuminates the conditions under which social democratic parties can unite behind more restrictive immigration policies and promote them consistently. Employing a most-similar systems design, it presents a comparative case study of the Austrian and Danish social democrats, from the 2015 ‘refugee crisis’ to 2020. The article argues that low levels of territorial decentralisation enabled the Danish social democrats to promote a restrictive stance on immigration top-down, while the Austrian social democrats’ federal party structure exacerbated internal disagreements between urban and rural leaders. These findings highlight the importance of internal party characteristics in explaining how parties respond to strategic trade-offs.

The Importance of Context and the Effect of Information and Deliberation on Opinion Change Regarding Environmental Issues in Citizens’ Juries,"['Andrew Thompson', 'Oliver Escobar', 'Jennifer J. Roberts[...]', 'Niccole M. Pamphilis']","Citizens’ juries have become a popular method for engaging citizens in deliberation about complex public policy issues, such as climate action and sustainable development. Empirical evidence routinely indicates that jurors change their minds throughout the process. What is less clear is when and why this occurs and whether the causes are consistent across juries that consider the same topic but are situated within different contexts. We present evidence of opinion change in citizens’ juries through a natural experiment, contrasting three local contexts of onshore windfarm development in Scotland; viz. existing, planned, and absent. Jurors’ individual opinions of climate change, wind energy, and windfarms were measured through questionnaires at four time points: the start, following information-giving, reflection, and deliberation. Statistical examination of jurors’ responses, through paired sample t-tests, Wilcoxon sign-tests, and Generalised Least Squares regression, reveals to what extent substantive changes were associated with different phases and locational contexts. In all three juries, opinion change occurs throughout the process, on different topics, and to different degrees. While the information phase consistently influences jurors’ opinions the most, jury composition affects the magnitude and direction of opinion change, with outcomes contingent on contexts. Our findings are important for informing how mini-publics are designed and used to inform environmental policy-making at different scales.",Article,1 , Sustainability,Sep 22,1,"

Mediation pathways for reduced substance use among parents in South Africa: a randomized controlled trial,"['Adeem Ahmad Massarwi', 'Lucie Cluver', 'Franziska Meinck[...]', 'Ohad Green']","Background Substance use is a major public health concern worldwide. Alcohol and drug use have increased during recent decades in many low- and middle-income countries, with South Africa, where this study was conducted, having among the highest rates in the world. Despite existing evidence on the effectiveness of family-based interventions in reducing substance use among parents and caregivers in low- and middle-income countries, little is known about the mechanism of change that contributes to the reduction. This study investigated mediators of change in a parenting programme (Parenting for Lifelong Health [PLH]) on reducing substance use among parents and caregivers of adolescents through three potential mediators: parental depression, parenting stress and family poverty. Methods The current study used a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial design. The total sample comprised 552 parent and caregiver of adolescents M = 49.37(SD = 14.69) who were recruited from 40 communities in South Africa’s Eastern Cape. Participants completed a structured confidential self-report questionnaire at baseline and a follow-up test 5 to 9 months after the intervention. Structural equation modeling was conducted to investigate direct and indirect effects. Results Analyses indicated that the effect of the PLH intervention on reducing parental substance use was mediated in one indirect pathway: improvement in parental mental health (reduction in parental depression levels). No mediation pathways from the PLH intervention on parental substance use could be associated with parenting stress or family poverty. Conclusions The findings of the study suggest that intervention approaches targeting mental healt

"Dilemmas of an Academic Feminist as Manager in the Neoliberal Academy: Negotiating Institutional Authority, Oppositional Knowledge and Change",['Fiona Mackay'],"While still rare, women are achieving important leadership roles as managers inside universities. This article explores the practical and theoretical dilemmas posed for academic feminists who enter such positions in the age of the rise of the ‘neoliberal academy’. These are familiar dilemmas for feminist bureaucrats – femocrats – working inside political, governmental, judicial and economic institutions but have been less explored with respect to the academy. What can academic feminists do when they take on middle or senior management roles? How do they experience being simultaneously the embodiment of institutional authority (to manage, regulate, quantify, monetise) as managers, as well as a source of oppositional knowledge as feminists? To what extent are there opportunities to work with the grain of an institution to challenge the gendered status quo from within? Or are academic feminists who manage inevitably co-opted and compromised? The article takes an autoethnographic approach to reflect upon the author’s experience as a ‘tempered radical’ in third tier management (as an executive dean and head of school) in a public research-intensive UK university, and to offer lessons about the radical potential of insider strategies of change.",Article,0 , Political Studies Review,Sep 13,0,"

Voices from the Past: Economic and Political Vulnerabilities in the Making of Next Generation EU Forthcoming in Comparative European Politics (Accepted version),"['Klaus Armingeon', 'Caroline de la Porte', 'Elke Heins', 'Stefano Sacchi']","In this article, we show that Next Generation EU (NGEU) is mainly a response to the economic and political imbalances left over from the Eurozone crisis. It is a pre-emptive intervention, especially targeted at structurally weak economies with rising Euroscepticism, to avoid costly ex-post bailouts as in the Great Recession. We demonstrate, using quantitative analysis, that pre-existing vulnerabilities, rather than the impact of the pandemic, drove the allocation of NGEU resources: per capita grants largely correspond to past economic vulnerabilities, as well as to political ones. Countries most vulnerable to another adjustment by austerity after the Covid-19 economic crisis receive most resources. Also, countries with strong anti-EU sentiments are entitled to larger NGEU grants per capita. In contrast, grants are not correlated with the severity of the health crisis. Then we show the domestic relevance of economic and political vulnerabilities through qualitative case studies of national political debates and domestic positions on NGEU in Italy, Germany and the Netherlands. Despite its innovative traits, NGEU is a politically constrained solution to address the mess from the previous decade, and as such, it is a Janus solution: promising a fresh start, but haunted by the past.",Preprint,,,Aug 31,0,"

In part, politicized religion may be a response to the challenges posed by feminist activism and by secular changes in the wider economy (Chhachhi, 1991). More certainly politicized religion has often been implicated in developments that are potentially deeply inimical to women’s interests—and yet many women’s energies have been successfully engaged in their support. Feminists can surely derive little satisfaction, for instance, from the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) ability to mobilize women in defense of Rām’s birthplace, often in far greater numbers than feminist organizations have managed to mobilize women to protest dowry murder.",Chapter,,,Aug 25,0,"

The impact of childhood psychological maltreatment on mental health outcomes in adulthood: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis,"['Zhuoni Xiao', 'Mina Murat Baldwin', 'Franziska Meinck[...]', 'Aja Louise Murray']","Background Research suggests that childhood psychological maltreatment (i.e., emotional abuse and emotional neglect) is associated with mental health problems that persist into adulthood, for example anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicidal ideation, and aggression; however, a systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing literature would help clarify the magnitude and moderators of these associations, and the extent to which they may be affected by publication bias, as well as the methodological strengths and weakness of studies in this area. Method The reporting of this protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) Statement.

We aimed to investigate long-term outcomes of the adalimumab (ADA) biosimilar SB5 in IBD patients following a switch from the ADA originator (SB5-switch cohort) or after start of SB5 (SB5-start cohort). Methods: We performed an observational cohort study in a tertiary IBD referral centre. All IBD patients treated with Humira® underwent an elective switch to SB5. We identified all these patients in a biologic prescription database that prospectively registered all ADA start and stop dates including brand names. Data on IBD phenotype, CRP, drug persistence, ADA drug and antibody levels, and faecal calprotectin were collected. Results: 481 patients were treated with SB5, 256 in the SB5-switch cohort (median follow-up: 13.7 months [8.6-15.2]) and 225 in the SB5-start cohort (median follow-up: 8.3 months [4.2-12.8]). 70.8% of the SB5-switch cohort remained on SB5 beyond one year; 90/256 discontinued SB5, mainly due to adverse events (46/90) or secondary loss of response (37/90). In the SB5-start cohort, 81/225 discontinued SB5 resulting in SB5-drug persistence of 60.3% beyond one year. No differences in clinical remission (p=0.53), CRP (p=0.80), faecal calprotectin (p=0.40) and ADA trough levels (p=0.55) were found between baseline, week 26 and week 52 following switch.

Patterns of adverse childhood experiences and associations with prenatal substance use and poor infant outcomes in a multi-country cohort of mothers: A Latent Class Analysis,"['Chad Lance Hemady', 'Lydia Speyer', 'Aja Louise Murray[...]', 'Manuel P Eisner']","Aims This paper explores the number and characterization of latent classes of adverse childhood experiences across the Evidence for Better Lives Study cohort and investigates how the various typologies link to prenatal substance use (i.e., smoking, alcohol, and illicit drugs) and poor infant outcomes (i.e., infant prematurity and low birth weight). Participants and setting A total of 1,189 mother-infant dyads residing in eight diverse low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) were recruited. Methods Latent class analysis using the Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars (BCH) 3-step method with auxiliary multilevel logistic regressions with distal outcomes were performed. Results The LCA identified three high-risk classes and one low-risk class, namely: (1) highly maltreated (7%, n = 89), (2) emotionally and physically abused with intra-familial violence exposure (13%, n = 152), (3), emotionally abused (40%, n = 474), and (4) low household dysfunction and abuse (40%, n = 474). Overall, across all latent classes, there were low probabilities of prenatal substance use and poor infant outcomes. However, pairwise comparisons between classes indicate that class 1 and 3 had higher probabilities of prenatal illicit drug use compared to class 4. Additionally, class 2 had higher probability of low birth weight compared to the three remaining classes. Conclusion The results further our understanding of the dynamic and multifaceted nature of ACEs. More research grounded on LMICs is warranted with more attention to various parameters of risk exposure (i.e., severity, duration, chronicity).",Preprint,,,Aug 1,1,"

The emerging norms of e-cigarette use among adolescents: A meta-ethnography of qualitative evidence,"['Hannah Smith', 'Mark Lucherini', 'Amanda Amos', 'Sarah Hill']","While qualitative research has indicated that adolescents’ motivation for e-cigarette use is different than adults’, this body of literature has not yet been brought together and synthesised. We reviewed qualitative evidence on perceptions and uses of e-cigarettes in order to explore the emerging norms of vaping among adolescents. We searched five databases for qualitative research in October 2019 with no restrictions on date of publication or data collection. We identified fifteen papers from thirteen studies. Using a meta-ethnographic approach, we identified a spectrum of descriptive and injunctive norms of vaping across the themes of addiction; perceptions of comparative harm; parental perceptions and peer perceptions. We found addiction and perceptions of comparative harm to reflect descriptive norms, while we found clearer evidence explaining the use and non-use of e-cigarettes through parental and peer approval of vaping. However, these norms were fluid, diverse and sometimes contradictory. This review provides a resource for researchers, policymakers and practitioners to better understand the ways that emerging norms could be influenced through policy and practice.",Literature Review,1 , The International journal on drug policy,Aug 1,0,"

A New Era of European Integration? Governance of Labour Market and Social Policy Since the Sovereign Debt Crisis,"['Caroline de la Porte', 'Elke Heins']","In this chapter we develop a typology of European Union (EU) integration to capture how, to what extent and according to which policy aims EU involvement in Member States has altered with respect to labour market and social policy and what it signifies in terms of institutional change. On this basis, first we show that new instruments—the Six-Pack, Fiscal Compact and Two-Pack—have been layered onto the existing institutional framework governing the European Monetary Union (EMU). Furthermore, we show that the instruments strengthening budgetary discipline to improve the functioning of the EMU have become more explicit in terms of policy objectives, particularly specifying new benchmarks to obtain fiscal discipline. They are also stricter in terms of surveillance and enforcement. Secondly, we show that there are initiatives to address and improve the social dimension of the EU—Europe 2020, the Social Investment Package and the Youth Guarantee—and that these have also emerged through a process of institutional layering. However, the aims around Europe 2020 and Social Investment continue to be based on the voluntary Open Method of Coordination, with comparatively weak surveillance and enforcement. In the current context, and to attain economic growth together with social cohesion and welfare, it is of utmost importance that EMU criteria should be altered to take account of social investments.",Chapter,,,Jul 29,1,"

When the results were aggregated, the nuances between the two regions were hidden. When the results were disaggregated between the regions, assumed patterns – such as the majority of migrants being external labor migrants – were still identified; however, distinct differences between them were also found. There was regional variation in the status of migrants prior to migrating, motivations for migration, remittance transfer options, proportion of migrants engaged in internal and external migration, and gender dynamics. Equally, for natural resource management use and risk, results also varied regionally.

We identify highly cited papers within each cluster and in each decade, not because citations are a good indicator of quality, but as a guide to recognising what questions were of wide interest at particular times. The clusters differ in their temporal profiles and bibliometric features; here we attempt to understand the origins of these differences.",Literature Review,1 , Journal of Neuroendocrinology,Jul 16,0,"

Public health and far-right: The Brazilian case of coronavirus infodemic,"['Ricardo Ribeiro Ferreira', 'Juliana Alcantara']","The rumours alarm sounded in Brazil in early January 2020, when disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak started to emerge. Besides a public health crisis, Brazil has been facing a political crisis. In less than two months, two health ministers resigned under a president who publicly discredits science. Numbers of contaminations and deaths show an exponential growth day by day, having already passed the glooming mark of 9 million cases and 230 thousand deaths. As Tedros Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), alerted for an “infodemic”, predicting the viral spread of misleading content about coronavirus in a pandemic scenario, we argue that covid-19 disinformation becomes a useful political tool, particularly for the far-right. Information plays a crucial role in decision-making processes and ways of living, alongside political positioning. Preliminary research in this area suggests a relation between misleading content and news cases of the disease (Singha et al., 2020; Moreno et al., 2020). This paper aims to map the flow of disinformation related to the pandemic in Brazil and discuss its main themes, examining possible connections with political issues and actors in the country. We employed a quantitative approach to publications that circulated on social media in 2020. First, we constructed a sample of 255 high engagement disinformation pieces using document analysis (Bowen, 2009). The previously stored material was accessed through the reports from the Brazilian leading fact-checking agency Aos Fatos. Then, we conducted a content analysis of the original disinformation pieces. Categories and variables were built by inductive-deductive method (Elo & Kyngas, 2018; Mayring, 2000). Our find

Creating an innovation ecosystem for rapid diagnostic tests for livestock to support sustainable antibiotic use,"['Ann Bruce', 'Katherine Adam', 'Henry Buller[...]', 'Joyce Tait']","Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of today’s greatest public health threats and reducing antimicrobial use in livestock is essential to prevent its spread, requiring rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to ensure that the drug prescribed matches the sensitivity of the disease organism. However, despite decades of research on RDTs and a relatively permissive regulatory environment in the UK, few devices are in commercial use. Challenges discussed by RDT developers included identifying commercially-viable targets, and management of the innovation ecosystem, e.g. to create clear pathways to market supporting positive interactions between farmers, vets, and other actors along the value chain. Future support for RDT development could be provided through incorporation in: assured food systems; business service packages provided by centralised laboratories; or animal health monitoring packages related to the spread of AMR. Breeding stock sales could require an accompanying health package including RDTs, vaccines and/or antibiotics, linking to precision agriculture approaches. Unlike the example of RDT development for COVID-19, it seems that the urgency of the issue and the clarity of links between animal and human health outcomes are not yet sufficient to support a fast-tracking programme for the development of RDTs to combat AMR.",Article,1 , Technology Analysis and Strategic Management,Jul 12,1,"

Multiple meanings in South Indian temple worship,['Anthony Good'],"The survival of the cosmos is said to depend upon proper performance of the complex daily liturgy in large Hindu temples. This paper describes such daily worship in the Murukan temple at Kalugumalai, South India. After considering the significance of the principal stages—unction, decoration, food‐offering, and lamp‐showing—in the pūja rite which forms the basis of worship in Saivite temples, it seeks to understand this liturgy with reference to Hindu metaphysics, iconography and mythology, and notions of divine sovereignty. It is argued that such multi‐thematic analyses, which combine ethnographic and indological approaches, are essential for understanding contemporary Hindu practice.",Article,,,Jul 11,0,"

Disinformation in anti-Eu Facebook Groups Digital Methods Initiative Winter School 2020,"['Aichatou Sow', 'Berit Renser', 'Camille Godineau[...]', 'Ines Narciso']","Since the 2016 United States presidential election (Faris et al., 2017), concerns have raised globally about the risk of instrumentalization of social media by political actors interested in interfering in the democratic process (Del-Fresno-García et. al, 2018). In Europe those concerns grew after reporting of disinformation campaigns in the Brexit (Cadwalladr, 2017), Cataluña (Marino et. al, 2019) and French elections (Chesney & Citron, 2019). Since then, interference of “fake news” in the political discourse has been thoroughly analysed (Fletcher et al., 2018; Jack, 2017; Bennett & Livingstone, 2018). Research that covers disinformation with an anti-European discourse focuses mostly on possible Russian interference, Twitter and big data sets (Golovchenko, et. al., 2018; Gorrell et. al., 2019, Pierri et. al., 2019) and there is not a lot of understanding about how anti-EU online communities interact, share and produce disinformation. More importantly, the current project tried to demonstrate the relevance of adapting methodologies to study not only disinformation but digital phenomena in general in an closed API environment (Bruns, 2019; Perriam et. al., 2019). The more hands-on approach of manually fact-checking, categorizing and analysing a smaller number of posts in an ever more closed platform like Facebook contradicts general research focusing on AI, big data, Twitter-based data collection and analysis. However, as translated in this current report and previous findings using the same methodology (Cardoso et. al. 2019), it contributes with valid issues for the knowledge base. https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/WinterSchool2020DisinformationEU#A_1",Research,,,Jul 6,1,"

Towards more comprehensive health law and policy research,"['The Law Centre For Health And Life - University of Amsterdam', 'Eleanor Brooks', 'Anniek De Ruijter']","In this comment, and drawing on the papers in the special issue, we ask: what are the core questions for the future of research into health law and policy, and European health law and policy more specifically? We first sketch the general functions and values of health law and policy. We then outline how these functions and values are affected by globalisation and Europeanisation, on the one hand, and technological change and digitalisation, on the other. In light of these developments we carve out some questions for future research and the implications of this agenda for the academic community that is working on European health law and policy.",Article,0 , Health Economics Policy and Law,,0,"

The COVID-19 pandemic: Failing forward in public health,"['The Law Centre For Health And Life - University of Amsterdam', 'Scott L Greer', 'Anniek De Ruijter', 'Eleanor Brooks']","Although most governments were heavily scrutinized and looked bad early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU was most noticeable for its absence. This might seem strange, for an institution whose public health role has been forged through crisis—from the thalidomide tragedy and the scandal of HIV-infected blood supplies, to “mad cow disease” and the underwhelming H1N1 influenza pandemic. A closer review of the EU’s health governance, however, reveals it to have performed exactly as expected and intended. An initial phase of disorganization and national egotism, unavoidable given that member states have historically restricted the EU’s health capacities, has been followed by a substantial new health policy agenda and a reinforcement of the EU’s market- and fiscal-based health influence. This is leading, we posit, to further integration.",Chapter,,,,0,"

How to study the populist radical right and the welfare state?,"['Philip Rathgeb', 'Marius R. Busemeyer']","This review article and special issue introduction argues that studying the relationship between the populist radical right and the welfare state requires bridging literatures that have so far advanced with little mutual engagement: party politics and voting behaviour research on the one hand, and comparative political economy and welfare state research on the other. In this way, the article highlights the advantages of connecting different academic sub-fields in studying radical right politics. First, the literature of comparative political economy on the multi-dimensionality of welfare politics can contribute to a clearer understanding of both the welfare-related causes and consequences of radical right support. Second, the party politics literature on the radical right’s ideology provides theoretical tools to explain the welfare-related consequences of populist radical right parties. The article illustrates the advantages of bridging these literatures through the empirical contributions in this special issue and concludes with avenues of future research.",Article,1 , West European Politics,Jul 1,0,"
