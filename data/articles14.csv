"Feasibility, acceptability and sustainability of postpartum contraceptive implant provision by midwives in NSW public hospitals","['Jessica R Botfield', 'Melanie Tulloch', 'Hannah Contziu[...]', 'Kirsten Black']","Background Repeat pregnancy in the first year after a birth is common. Many of these conceptions are unintended and may be prevented by providing access to contraception in the immediate postpartum period. Midwives in the hospital setting could potentially play a greater role in improving postnatal contraception information and provision. Aim We sought to implement and examine the success of a program training hospital-based midwives in immediate postpartum implant insertion. Methods This mixed methods study in two hospitals in New South Wales sought to explore the feasibility, acceptability and sustainability of a program that provided competency-based implant insertion training for midwives. The study documented training completion, implant insertion numbers and experience, and conducted end of study interviews with midwives and stakeholders. Findings Twenty-seven midwives undertook training and inserted 265 implants during the study period. Interviews with 13 midwives and 11 stakeholders concluded the program to be feasible and acceptable with midwives reporting high satisfaction from their involvement. All interviewees felt that midwives were well placed to insert implants, and reported that challenges around workload and opportunities for practice were generally manageable. It was recognised that sustainability of the program would require supportive policy and regular insertion opportunities. Conclusions Midwives successfully upskilled in implant insertions and there was widespread support for the program with expectations it would be sustained. Provision of contraceptive information and implant insertion by midwives in the immediate postpartum period is likely to incr

Philanthropy and the Feminist Ethics of Care: Prospects and Problems,"['Annie Herro', 'Franklin Obeng-Odoom']","Surging philanthropic enterprises across the globe have raised questions about different approaches to giving and their associated moral theories. Much attention has been devoted to 'effective altruism', an outgrowth of the broader paradigm of 'effective' philanthropy which is aimed at addressing social problems using a businesslike , data-driven, outcome-oriented approach. Hierarchical in its decision-making structures and patterned after patriarchal social relations, effective altruism marginalises the weaker parties in the deliberations surrounding funding. The feminist ethics of care constitutes a formidable alternative because it emphasises contextuality, relationality and gender-equitable structures of care in philanthropy. Yet, apart from taking insufficient account of multiple identities, such as sexualities and race, class and caste, this paradigm overlooks hierarchical geographical and socio-spatial relations across the world and elevates household relations over community relations. More fundamentally, as a paradigm, care ethics portrays the existence and persistence of global inequalities and stratification as fortuitous, amenable to the care of the privileged. We highlight the importance of evolving care-based philanthropy to strengthen alternatives to effective altruism.",Preprint,,,,0,"

Taking the Research Journey Together: The Insider and Outsider Experiences of Aboriginal and Non-Aboriginal Researchers.,"['Angela Dew', 'Elizabeth Mcentyre', 'Priya Vaughan']","Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of Australia are among the most researched in the world. Indigenous research methodologies reframe a historical colonial-centric and often exploitative research paradigm, to instead privilege the voices and perspectives of Indigenous peoples within a social justice framework. In this article, we describe the lessons learnt in a research partnership between an Aboriginal and two Anglo-Australian researchers conducting an arts-based action research project in collaboration with five Aboriginal communities in New South Wales, Australia. We identify the importance of reflexivity to shed light on the impact of insider and outsider status in order to design and conduct culturally and ethically informed research with Aboriginal communities. Reflexivity, and a collaborative, adaptive approach to research processes also operates to ensure cultural and professional integrity are embedded into such research projects.",Article,9 , Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung,,0,"

A Novel Approach to First-Rib Resection in Neurogenic Thoracic Outlet Syndrome,"['Yueying Li', 'Yanxi Liu', 'Zhan Zhang[...]', 'Shusen Cui']","Objectives: The treatment for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (NTOS) conventionally involves first-rib resection (FRR) surgery, which is quite challenging to perform, especially for novices, and is often associated with postoperative complications. Herein, we report a new segmental resection approach through piezo surgery that involves using a bone cutter, which can uniquely provide a soft tissue protective effect. Methods: This retrospective study involved the examination of 26 NTOS patients who underwent piezo surgery and another group of 30 patients who underwent FRR using the conventional technique. In the patient group that underwent piezo surgery, the rib was first resected into two pieces using a piezoelectric device and subsequently removed. In the patient group that underwent conventional surgery, the first rib was removed as one piece using a rib cutter and rongeurs. Results: The piezo surgery group had significantly shorter operative time (96.85 ± 14.66 vs. 143.33 ± 25.64 min, P < 0.001) and FRR duration (8.73 ± 2.11 vs. 22.23 ± 6.27 min, P < 0.001) than the conventional group. The posterior stump length of the residual rib was shorter in the piezo surgery group than in the conventional group (0.54 ± 0.19 vs. 0.65 ± 0.15 cm, P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in postoperative complications and scores of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, the Cervical Brachial Symptom Questionnaire (CBSQ), and the visual analog scale (VAS). Even the TOS index (NTOS Index = [DASH + (0.83 × CBSQ) + (10 × VAS)]/3) and patient self-assessments of both the groups showed no significant differences.

Explaining divergent National Responses to Covid-19: An Enhanced State Capacity Framework,"['Linda Weiss', 'Elizabeth Thurbon']","We develop a state capacity framework to account for different national responses to Covid-19. Our starting point is the influential idea that neoliberalism has a major role to play in state failure to control the pandemic. By implementing neoliberal reforms, states have ostensibly rendered themselves incapable of preventing or mitigating the viral outbreak. A focus on the British experience lends weight to this perspective. But when viewed in a comparative light, the picture is less straightforward. By comparing the British and Australian cases, we see a similar embrace of neoliberal reforms across the whole of government, yet with strikingly divergent outcomes. How can we account for this dramatic difference? To answer this question, we offer an enhanced state capacity framework to improve our understanding of diverse national responses to Covid-19. Our larger objective is to enrich the existing state capacity literature in two ways. First, we extend the existing state capacity framework by introducing a new category – salutary capacity – to encapsulate a state's ability to correct and counteract the course of a national health emergency. Second, we introduce the idea of political choice to emphasise the importance of agency in offsetting the institutional weaknesses associated with neoliberal reform.",Article,1 , New Political Economy,,1,"

Relationship-Based Practice in Therapeutic Residential Care: A Double-Edged Sword,"['Kenny Kor', 'Elizabeth Fernandez', 'Jo Spangaro']","This article draws on the lived experiences and perspectives of young people and practitioners in therapeutic residential care to examine what constitutes relationship-based practice. Eight young people and twenty-six practitioners across three residential care services in Australia participated in this qualitative study. Framework analysis identifies that personalised engagement, a delicate balance between care and control, and perseverance through turbulent times are conducive to relationship-based practice in therapeutic residential care. Relationship-based practice is also found to be employed in a unique historical and relational context that demands mindful navigation through three specific professional boundary issues including self-disclosure, over-identification and physical contact. Against this context, relationship-based practice in therapeutic residential care is considered a ‘double-edged sword’, offering practitioners copious opportunities to build connections with young people in informal environments whilst needing to mitigate multiple ethical ambiguities. Implications for practice include the need to safeguard the ‘do no harm’ priority whilst resisting defensive or detached practice. Contextualising relationship-based practice within an ethical practice framework to embed ethics work in day-to-day practice becomes paramount.",Article,1 , British Journal of Social Work,,0,"

Male dominated workplaces and the power of masculine privilege: a comparison of the Australian Political and Construction sectors,"['Natalie Galea', 'Louise Chappell']","Increasing women's representation in male dominated work sectors remains a persistent problem. This paper reorientates the focus from women's underrepresentation to male overrepresentation and privilege, to identify and compare the causal mechanisms between the overrepresentation of men in two traditionally male dominated work places in Australia: politics and construction. By applying feminist institutionalism, masculinities and privilege, it argues the overrepresentation of men is linked to gendered rules that uphold hegemonic masculinities which produce masculine privilege and supports a gender hierarchy. Masculine privilege occurs via three mechanisms: 1. a culture of denial; 2. perceptions that rules are neutral, legitimate and applied objectively; 3. through backlash and resistance to keep the gender status quo in place. We argue the effects of privilege combine to act as a barrier to the attraction, retention and progression of women to both sectors and conclude that the masculine privilege provides a valuable lens to explore how male dominance operates within work sectors.

Corrigendum to: Cost–benefit analysis of enhancing the uptake of long-acting reversible contraception in Australia,"['Kristine Concepcion', 'Sarina Lacey', 'Kevin McGeechan[...]', 'Jessica R Botfield']","Objective Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) is the most effective form of reversible contraception, but its use in Australia is low compared with other countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the economic effect of an increase in LARC uptake to international rates.Methods An economic model was designed to assess two scenarios, namely increasing the current rate of LARC uptake of 12.5% to the international benchmark of 14.8% among: (1) women currently using the oral contraceptive pill (OCP); and (2) women at risk of pregnancy and not using contraception. Model inputs included cost of contraceptive methods, discontinuation rates and abortion and miscarriage costs associated with unintended pregnancies.ResultsWomen who switch from an OCP to LARC would save A$114–157 per year. Those not currently using any contraception who adopt LARC would incur costs of A$36–194 per year, but would reap savings from the reduction in unintended pregnancies. Over 5 years there would be a net saving of A$74.4 million for Scenario 1 and A$2.4 million for Scenario 2.Conclusion Greater use of LARC would result in a net gain in economic benefits to Australia. These benefits are largely driven by women switching from an OCP to LARC who have reduced costs, as well as women wishing to avoid pregnancy who choose to use LARC rather than no method. This evidence will support women making an informed contraceptive choice and policy makers in increasing the accessibility of LARC.What is known about the topic?LARC is the most effective form of reversible contraception, but uptake in Australia is relatively low.What does this paper add?There are economic benefits to society for women w

Overcoming incumbent resistance to the clean energy shift: How local governments act as change agents in coal power station closures in China,"['Hao Tan', 'Elizabeth Thurbon', 'Sung-Young Kim', 'John A. Mathews']","Phasing out the use of coal for power generation is an important concern for energy policy in the context of green transition. Despite the efforts of other nations, the role of China in the global phase-out of coal power remains crucial. Our study with a sub-national focus sheds important new light on the drivers and decision-making dynamics of exiting of coal power use in China. Based on a case study of closures of coal power plants in China's Guangdong province, we find that under certain circumstances, governments - especially those in the provincial and city levels - can and do act as change agents when it comes to retirement of coal fired power stations. Our study reveals a number of push and pull mechanisms that governments have utilized to overcome the resistance of incumbent power generation companies, primarily based on developmental considerations. By identifying the drivers and enabling mechanisms of phasing out the use of coal power in a significant sub-national region in China, our study contributes to both of the sustainability transition literature and the energy policy literature.",Article,1 , Energy Policy,Jan 14,0,"

Differences in public and private health services in a rural district of Malaysia,"['Syed Mohamed Aljunid', 'Anthony Zwi']","A cross-sectional study, comparing the nature of services in 15 private clinics and 6 public health facilities, was undertaken in a rural district of Malaysia. Semi-structured interviews and observations using check-lists were employed. Public health facilities were run by younger doctors (mean age = 31.1 years), supported mostly by trained staff. The private clinics were run by older doctors (mean age = 41.2 years) who had served the district for much longer (8.9 years vs 1.5 years) but were supported by less well trained staff. The curative services were the main strength of the private clinics but their provision of preventive care was less comprehensive and of inferior quality. Private clinics were inclined to provide more expensive diagnostic services than the public facilities.

Urban water security under a changing climate: Is Nepal's water policy on the right track?,"['Hemant Raj Ojha', 'Kamal Devkota', 'Chandra Pandey[...]', 'Anthony Zwi']","en Nepal's urban regions are facing increasing levels of water insecurity under a changing climate. The country has a long history of water policy development while climate-related policies are also emerging at different levels of the new federal republic. It is unclear whether public policy is on the right track to ensure urban water security in the face of growing demand and increasingly variable supply. In this paper, we assess how Nepal's water policy is shaping urban adaptation. We focus on how policies have defined institutional arrangements for water supply and management, allocation of water rights, and the conservation of water source catchments. Policy attention to these issues is crucial for the adaptation of water systems to climate change. Drawing on the review of policy texts and the status of policy implementation in two towns (Dharan and Dhulikhel), we conclude that current policy frameworks and strategies neglect opportunities to facilitate urban water adaptation to climate change. The neglect is seen in escalating conflicts among institutions, an unclear framework for water rights, and inadequate incentives for catchment conservation. We highlight the need for a more coherent and risk sensitive approach to water policy, underpinned by deliberative, research-informed, and learning-based strategies. 摘要 zh 气候变化背景下, 尼泊尔的城市地区正面临越来越严重的水不安全。该国拥有悠久的水政策发展史, 同时, 与气候相关的政策也正出现于该国的不同层面。尚不清晰的是, 面临水需求上涨和日益变化的水供给时, 公共政策是否在确保城市水安全的正轨上。本文中, 我们评估了尼泊尔水政策如何影响城市适应(urban adaptation)。我们聚焦于政府如何定义水供应和管理方面的制度安排、水权分配以及水源流域的保护。对这些问题给予政策关注, 对气候变化下的水系统适应而言是关键的。基于对政策文本的分析和两城市(Dharan 和Dhulikhel)的政策落实状态, 我们的结论认为, 现有政策框架和策略忽视了一系列能促进气候变化下城市水适应的机遇。这种忽视体现在机构间冲突的加剧、水权框架的不清晰、以及用于流域保护的激励措施不足。我们强调需要一个更一致的、对风险保持敏感的水政策措施, 辅以商议性的、基于研究和学习的策略。 Resumen es Las regiones urbanas de Nepal se enfrentan a niveles crecientes de inseguridad hídrica en un clima cambiante. El país tiene una larga historia de desarrollo de políticas de agua, mientras que las políticas relacionadas con el clima también están surgiendo en diferentes niveles de la nueva república federal. No está claro si las políticas públicas están en el camino correcto para garantizar la seguridad hídrica urbana frente a la creciente demanda y la oferta cada vez más variable. En este documento, evaluamos cómo la política hídrica de Nepal está dando forma a la adaptación urbana. Nos enfocamos en cómo las políticas han definido los arreglos institucionales para el suministro y la gestión del agua, la asignación de derechos de agua y la conservación de las cuencas de captación de fuentes de agua. La atención política a estos temas es crucial para la adaptación de los sistemas de agua al cambio climático. Basándonos en la revisión de los textos de políticas y el estado de implementación de políticas en dos ciudades (Dharan y Dhulikhel), llegamos a la conclusión de que los marcos de políticas y las estrategias actuales ignoran las oportunidades para facilitar la adaptación del agua urbana al cambio climático. La negligencia se ve en la escalada de conflictos entre instituciones, un marco poco claro para los derechos de agua e incentivos inadecuados para la conservación de las cuencas hidrográficas. Destacamos la necesidad de un enfoque de la política del agua más coherente y sensible al riesgo, respaldado por estrategias deliberativas, informadas por la investigación y basadas en el aprendizaje.",Article,1 , World Water Policy,Nov 18,0,"

“Our ways to planning”: Preparing to plan with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with disability,"['Angela Dew', 'Elizabeth Mcentyre', 'Leanne Dowse', 'Priya Vaughan']","This paper reports on the development of the Our Ways to Planning framework. The framework is intended as a guide for Australian organisations to work in safe and culturally appropriate ways to assist and enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with disability to make plans about their physical and mental health, wellbeing and future. The Our Ways to Planning framework is based on data collected via community-led research undertaken with Aboriginal people with disability and their family members and workers from five communities in New South Wales. Community mapping, an arts-based research method, was used to learn about the experiences of Aboriginal people with disability and their families regarding planning and access to services. Using iterative, thematic analysis, the research team identified core themes and concepts around which to structure the framework. The framework identifies three 'bridges' to organisational readiness for planning: knowledge, understanding and choice. It focuses on the importance of non-Aboriginal-led organisations learning from, and collaborating with, community-based Aboriginal-led organisations in order to build capacity in both types of organisations. The framework advocates for open and respectful organisational engagement with the needs of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people with disability. It also acknowledges the importance of developing an awareness of Aboriginal cultures, histories and points of view, given their influence on planning processes.

Practitioners’ experience of implementing therapeutic residential care: A multi-perspective study,"['Kenny Kor', 'Elizabeth Fernandez', 'Jo Spangaro']","Repeated inquiries into residential care for children and young people in out-of-home care have documented persistent service inadequacies. Calls for reforming residential care into therapeutic care have received growing attention in recent years. However, limited research data exists to inform how therapeutic care can be optimally implemented in residential care settings. This research draws on the first-hand experience of residential care practitioners to examine the barriers they experienced when implementing therapeutic care. Twenty-six practitioners across five different service strata (senior managers, therapeutic specialists, caseworkers, team leaders and direct care workers) from three Australian residential care organizations participated in semi-structured interviews. Framework analysis of the interview data indicated, whilst there was a strong consensus that therapeutic residential care should be underpinned by trauma-informed knowledge, its implementation is constrained by six barriers: (1) inconsistent understandings of how therapeutic care should be operationalized; (2) crisis-driven referrals and assessments; (3) problematic placement configuration and client mix; (4) inadequate workforce development; (5) the emotional cost of care; and (6) atrophied clinical support. These barriers call into question the extent to which therapeutic residential care is implemented as intended. Findings indicate that, to actualize the full potential of therapeutic residential care, substantial work is needed to provide a more translatable practice framework, strengthen referral and assessment processes, revitalize the workforce and elevate implementation efforts to a systemic level, bringing closer alignment between different se

"Exploring the relationship between functional limitations of the older adults and the health-related quality of life of their spouse in Shaanxi Province, China","['Wanyue Dong', 'Anthony Zwi', 'Chi Shen[...]', 'Jianmin Gao']","Background With trends towards longer life expectancy, lifetime with disability has also been prolonged. It is increasingly recognized that not only the person with disability but also those around them are affected. The relationship between functional limitation (FL) of the older adults and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of their spouse is of interest. So too is the determination of the factors aside from FL that influence HRQoL. Methods The sample was derived from the 2013 National Health Service Survey conducted in Shaanxi Province in China. Married couples aged ≥ 60 years were selected (n = 3463). The European quality of life five dimensions (EQ-5D) and visual analogue scale were used to measure HRQoL. Results Both wife and husband reported lower HRQoL if either the male or female partner had some or serious FLs ( P < 0.001). Other factors associated with lower HRQoL of the spouse included age, lower educational level, presence of chronic disease, and lower household economic status. Family size was associated with wife's HRQoL only when the male had no FL and lived with another 1–2 persons, or when the male had some FLs and lived in a larger family (n ≥ 5). Residential status did not relate to the HRQoL of spouses regardless of FL status. Conclusions Older adults in Shaanxi province who have partners with FLs tend to report poorer EQ-5D, suggesting that couples amongst whom one has FL may be particularly vulnerable to lower HRQoL.",Article,1 , Health and Quality of Life Outcomes,Sep 1,1,"

Implementing a crèche-based community drowning programme in rural Bangladesh: A process evaluation,"['Medhavi Gupta', 'Aminur Rahman', 'Notan C Dutta[...]', 'Jagnoor Jagnoor']","Background Living and environmental conditions in rural Bangladesh expose children to drowning. The Anchal programme protects children through crèche-based supervision in an enclosed space run by locally recruited carers. It is unclear under what conditions the programme best operates to maximise protection. We conducted a process evaluation of Anchal to determine enabling factors and challenges to implementation. Methods Quantitative programme data were analysed to calculate metrics including child participation and fidelity of implementation to defined processes. Qualitative data collection with programme participants and implementers provided insights into barriers and enablers of implementation. Analysis was guided by the UK Medical Research Council’s process evaluation framework. Results Anchal operated 400 centres with an average of 22.2 children enrolled, as per target. However, daily attendance averaged lower than the 80% target. Children aged 1–2 years old, who are most at risk of drowning, were least likely to enrol and attend regularly due to low engagement with activities and parental concerns for safety. Greater distances and lower educational attainment in some regions reduced attendance and increased carer attrition. Conclusions The Anchal programme met most programme delivery targets. However, programme success could be improved through increasing supervision, providing communication training for implementing staff, designing programmes for children aged 1–2 years old, encouraging community ownership and providing child pick-up services. These contextual solutions can be adapted to similar programmes operating through grassroots-level engagement and recruitment of com

The findings of the study uncover some of the profound challenges staff encounter in detecting and responding to different exploitative practices. Furthermore, they underscore the significant disjunctions between existing legislative provisions that aim to address modern slavery, and the experiences and understandings of workers at the frontline of the issue.

The most common diagnoses were schizophrenia (54%) and intellectual disability (33%). Patients were detained on average for 4.2 years, which is slightly shorter than the average maximum term imposed. Of the 55 people for whom criminal record data were available, 9.1% were charged with an offence during the first year post-release and 60% overall were charged for at least one post-release offence during a follow-up period ranging from 4.7 to 11.1 years.",Article,1 , Psychiatry Psychology and Law,Jan 22,0,"

"Gender, health and ageing in Fiji: a mixed methods analysis","['Rebecca Dodd', 'Janani Shanthosh', 'Thomas Lung[...]', 'Anna Palagyi']","Background Women are disadvantaged by ageing: older women are more likely than older men to suffer from ill-health, have less access to health care and suffer discrimination within the health care system. Globally, there is a dearth of health research on gender and ageing with substantial knowledge gaps in low and middle-income country contexts. Part of a wider investigation on health and ageing in Fiji, our objective was to identify and describe gendered differences in healthy ageing in this Pacific Island context which we believe to be the first such study in the Pacific region. Methods Applying a health systems lens, we used a mixed-methods approach, encompassing analysis of cause of death data; focus group discussion to gather community and family attitudes to health services; and policy analysis, and then used data triangulation techniques to draw out key themes and insights. Results We found that gender affects health outcomes among older persons, attitudes towards and experience of healthy ageing, and an older person’s access to and use of health services. We also found that while Fiji’s policy response to ageing has recognised the importance of gender, to-date there has been limited action to address gender differences. Gender (as oppose to sex differences) has direct and indirect implications for the health of older Fijians, while gendered inequalities and patriarchal norms appear to affect both men and women’s experience of ageing and the health system response. Further, gender and age discrimination may be intersecting, intensifying their separate effects. Conclusion This study demonstrates the feasibility and importance of applying a gender lens to the study of healthy ageing. Our findings from Fiji are like

Production and distribution of child sexual abuse material by parental figures,"['Michael Salter', 'Tim Wong']","Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is widely available online. Existing research indicates that the parents and parental figures of victims are notably represented in offender populations. However, there is limited research in this area. Drawing on Australian media and legal databases, this study created a database of 82 cases of CSAM production and distribution perpetrated by parents and/or parental figures from 2009 to 2019. The study found that perpetrators are most often the male parental figures of the victims, and victims are predominately girls under nine years of age. The findings reveal distinct patterns and scenarios of parental CSAM offending that may inform prevention, early intervention and improved responses to victims. The study documented the significant impact of parental CSAM offending on victims and the need for specialist victim support.",Book,,,Nov 4,1,"

Relevance in a state of flux: Civil society and environmental protection in Kazakhstan,['Fengshi Wu'],"This chapter explores the key mechanisms at work that have enabled the civil society actors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to not only sustain themselves but also continue to be relevant in environmental protection and social justice building in the unsettling political environment of Kazakhstan. Focusing on nature conservation, this research has found that NGOs have been able to retain their organizational autonomy and policy impact by both working with the existing institutional opportunities and mobilizing resistance outside the state system. Moreover, a decent level of autonomy and self-capacity of local NGOs and civil society group is the prerequisite, not the outcome, of having effective support from international organizations, particularly United Nations agencies and well-established global environmental NGOs, in the authoritarian context.",Preprint,,,,0,"

Facilitating access to scene photographs and CCTV footage for relatives bereaved after violent death,"['Jane Mowll', 'Gillian Adams', 'Juliet Darling']","Family members bereaved after a violent death may be prevented from seeing visual images such as photographs of the body or closed circuit television footage of the person at the scene of death taken as part of the investigation. However, there is little information on the helpfulness or otherwise of supported exposure to such, often graphic, visual evidentiary material contained in police reports. We draw on a case study approach to explore the lived experience of two bereaved family members and the practice experience of the social work authors to understand the meanings of seeing these visual images. These lived-practice experiences suggest that seeing such visual images, in the context of support, may provide a deeper understanding of the death event and facilitate a sense of peace for bereaved relatives. This paper contributes an insight into the meanings and benefits as well as the practice challenges of viewing such material which, it is argued, are differently experienced from seeing the body itself. Recommendations for practice are discussed, alongside suggestions for future research in representative samples.",Article,7 , Bereavement Care,Sep 14,0,"

Sexuality education for primary school students with disability in Fiji,"['Jessica R Botfield', 'Sera Ratu', 'Esiteri Turagabeci[...]', 'Yan Cheng']","Background People with disability have the same sexual and reproductive health needs and rights as people without disability, yet experience considerable barriers in accessing information and services. The Reproductive and Family Health Association of Fiji, Family Planning Australia, and disability stakeholders implemented a comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) disability inclusion project to increase access for students with disability to age-appropriate sexuality education. Method A train the trainer model was utilised, whereby staff and disability stakeholders undertook competency-based training on delivering sexuality education to teachers and people with disability, then trained and supported teachers working in special disability schools to provide sexuality education to students. An evaluation explored the acceptability and effectiveness of the project, utilising baseline and endline surveys and interviews. Findings From 2016 to 2018, the CSE disability project reached teachers and students in nine special disability schools in Fiji. At project completion, teachers reported increased confidence overall in teaching about sexuality and relationships, and students demonstrated increased knowledge regarding puberty and body changes. Interview findings suggested the project contributed to overcoming silence and stigma for people with disability and promoting safety for young people. Conclusion Age- and developmentally appropriate sexuality education for people with disability is essential for equipping them with necessary knowledge and skills. The CSE disability project utilised a collaborative, capacity building approach to co-design and implement sexuality education in special disability schools in Fiji. With co

"The significance of technology as both a resource in enhancing safety, and a means of perpetrating violence: the implications for policy and practice","['Sandra Gendera', 'kylie valentine', 'Jan Breckenridge']","There is evidence that technological devices such as personal safety alarms and security cameras can be effective in contributing to an increased sense of safety for victims of domestic and family violence, when they are provided as part of a broader programme of support. This article reports on findings from a mixed methods evaluation of a programme trialled in Queensland, Australia. The programme was funded by the Commonwealth Department of Social Services as part of the Keeping Women Safe in Their Home initiative. The trial was comprised of two components: the provision of personal safety alarms and security cameras to victims, and the resourcing of service providers to identify and respond to technology-facilitated abuse experienced by their clients. The findings from the evaluation of the trial contribute to an emerging evidence base on technology as a means to support and increase the safety of victims of violence. The findings also contribute to evidence on the capacity of the sector to respond to the use of technology to harass, monitor and stalk victims.There are benefits to clients and service providers from the innovative use of technology as part of a holistic and flexible domestic and family violence service response to meet the needs of victims, including those who wish to remain in their home. However, service providers in the trial felt less confident in supporting victims of technology-facilitated abuse. The limited uptake of strategies provided to assess and monitor technology-facilitated abuse indicates that support workers in the domestic violence sector would benefit from capacity building in this area.

'For my safety' Experiences of technology-facilitated abuse among women with intellectual disability or cognitive disability,"['Bridget Harris', 'Delanie Woodlock']","This research explores experiences of technology-facilitated abuse among women living with intellectual or cognitive disability. The findings are based on interviews with women with intellectual or cognitive disability and frontline workers who provide support services. This research was commissioned to address major gaps in the evidence about technology-facilitated abuse against women with intellectual or cognitive disability. The report reveals that the tactics used for technology-facilitated abuse of women with intellectual or cognitive disability are like those faced by all women, but there are some unique differences. Summary of key findings: Women's experiences Technology featured in the women’s lives in important ways. They used a variety of digital devices and platforms to connect with friends, family and partners as well as access information and services. In some instances, perpetrators could remove technology from these women, which could impact their autonomy, wellbeing and safety. The women had experienced a range of abuses, from general harassment to misuse of their online accounts, being monitored using spyware and tracking devices, and having their intimate images or videos shared without their consent. While most commonly the perpetrator was a partner or ex-partner, they included family members, carers and strangers. Barriers to support: Fear was a primary barrier for the women in seeking help for technology-facilitated abuse, including fear of having digital devices, apps and internet access removed, or of not being believed. In some instances, a woman’s situation was further complicated because her partner was also her carer. Women could feel trapped by needing to maintain access to their children

"Балансы сил, угроз и интересов: логика стратегического сближения Китая и России в постбиполярный период [Balances of Power, Threat, and Interests: The Logic behind China-Russia Strategic Alignment in the Post-Cold War Period]",['Alexander Korolev'],"Со времени распада СССР отношения между Китаем и Россией демонстрируют устойчивую позитивную динамику, по многим параметрам приближаясь к стратегическому союзу. При этом большинство попыток выявления причин этого сближения, как правило, ограничиваются указанием на продолжающееся ухудшение отношений этих стран с Западом, прежде всего США. Однако такой подход представляется недостаточным, поскольку не позволяет в полной мере выявить детерминанты российско-китайского сближения и оценить устойчивость данной тенденции. В представленной статье на основе современных наработок в теории формирования стратегических межгосударственных союзов предпринята попытка дать комплексную оценку причин формирования и эволюции отношений Российской Федерации и КНР, связав их с общей логикой развития системы международных отношений в постбиполярный период. Для этого автор предлагает опереться на эпистемологический потенциал трех основных подходов к объяснению причин формирования стратегических союзов, представленных концепциями «баланса сил», «баланса угроз» и «баланса интересов». При этом предлагается проанализировать российско-китайское взаимодействие не только с точки зрения изменений внутри каждого из этих балансов по отдельности, но и с позиции их взаимного переплетения и взаимного влияния.

What’s on offer: how do parties appeal to women voters in election manifestos?,"['Anna Sanders', 'Francesca Gains', 'Claire Annesley']","Existing research has tended to examine party manifesto appeals to women voters as a homogenous group however we know relatively little about how parties appeal to different groups of women voters. Yet there are strong incentives for parties to respond to and reflect diversity in women’s voting behaviour. Through a gendered analysis of party manifestos at the 2015, 2017 and 2019 British general elections, we investigate the spread and reach of parties’ policy appeals to women voters. We find that, while the principal state-wide parties are increasingly recognizing women’s diversity in their policy pledges, some groups of women remain marginalized from parties’ electoral agendas. Our findings extend the empirical and analytical understanding of how political parties make gendered appeals during election times and to whom. We argue the way parties seek to appeal to the diversity of women is important for the analysis of both issue ownership and interparty competition for women’s votes. Additionally, we make a normative case for parties to recognize diversity and intersectionality in their manifesto policy promises.",Article,1 , Journal of Elections Public Opinion and Parties,Sep 16,0,"

"COVID‐19 lockdowns, intimate partner violence and coercive control","['Ciara Smyth', 'Patricia Cullen', 'Jan Breckenridge[...]', 'kylie valentine']","2020 was a year like no other, with the COVID‐19 virus upending life as we know it. When governments around the world imposed lockdown measures to curb the spread of COVID‐19, advocates in the domestic and family violence (DFV) sector recognised that these measures were likely to result in increases in violence against women, particularly intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV can take many forms, including physical, emotional, psychological, financial, coercive controlling behaviours, surveillance and isolation tactics. Lockdown conditions provide fertile ground for the exercise of coercive control by encouraging people to stay at home, limiting social interactions to household members, reducing mobility and enabling perpetrators to closely monitor their partner's movements. However, media reports and awareness of IPV are generally dominated by a focus on physical violence and lethality, which are easily defined and measured. By contrast, coercive control as a concept is difficult to operationalise, measure and action in law, policy and frontline interventions. This paper discusses the challenges inherent in measuring coercive control and engages with current debates around the criminalisation of coercive control in NSW. Such reflection is timely as the conditions of COVID‐19 lockdowns are likely to lead to an increase in coercive controlling behaviours.",Article,1 , The Australian journal of social issues,Apr 30,0,"

-3 - SUPPORT FOR THE SALIVATION-EGESTION HYPOTHESIS FOR XYLELLA FASTIDIOSA INOCULATION: BACTERIAL CELLS CAN PENETRATE VECTOR SALIVA IN XYLEM Principal Investigator: Researcher,"['Elaine Backus', 'Kim Andrews']","Research is underway to develop varieties of grape that are resistant to Pierce's disease (PD) caused by Xylella fastidiosa (Xf). PD has become economically important since introduction of an exotic vector, glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS). However, achieving resistance to vector acquisition and inoculation is hampered by lack of knowledge of the Xf inoculation mechanism, despite nearly 70 years of research on this topic. Recent work suggests that bacterial cells spread from the cibarium (the retention reservoir) into the precibarium, from which inoculation occurs. Backus's recently published salivation-egestion hypothesis for inoculation proposes that saliva is brought up into the precibarium, where it is mechanically swept across taste organs by the precibarial valve. This mechanical action, combined with the enzymatic action of the saliva, dislodges bacteria in the precibarium, which are then forcefully egested (expelled) out of the stylets in a mixture of plant fluid and saliva that enters a xylem cell. The present preliminary study tested whether Xf bacteria can penetrate existing, hardened GWSS salivary sheaths. GWSS were allowed to feed for 24 hours on a grape stem, depositing salivary sheaths. After the insects were removed, the stem was needle-inoculated with Xf in the feeding area, then immunoprobed for Xf and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results showed Xf-lined needle punctures into xylem cells. Xf bacteria were drawn into xylem vessels and traveled varying distances from the punctures. Bacteria encountered and penetrated into undamaged, existing sheath saliva in xylem cells. The apparent ability of bacteria to penetrate into hardened sheaths suggests that Xf should be able to migrate out of newly-secreted

Enabling Pathways for Students from Refugee and Asylum-Seeker Backgrounds in Higher Education: Aspirations About Progression to Postgraduate Studies,"['Catherine Clark', 'Caroline Lenette']","University students from refugee and asylum-seeker backgrounds (SRABs) have unique resettlement experiences related to disrupted education, family expectations, financial pressures, and visa uncertainty. These arduous experiences often translate into a strong determination to access education and persevere with tertiary studies. Supportive educational trajectories are crucial to increase social cohesion and help redress the personal and social disadvantages SRABs face. Yet, there is virtually no attention paid to aspirations about progression to postgraduate studies despite the diverse aspirations and talents of many. This article reports on a qualitative study that explored the perspectives of six SRABs and two academics at an Australian university on aspirations to postgraduate studies. Participants identified several obstacles and opportunities at personal, institutional, community, and policy levels. Many existing recommendations in the enabling pathways literature focus on what universities could do differently, but we argue for a whole-of-person approach that considers institutional as well as personal issues, to increase prospects of SRABs progressing to postgraduate studies. Universities can assist with better institutional support structures, mentoring, raising staff awareness about SRABs, and financial aid. While institutions might not be able to directly address financial, visa, and personal concerns, universities can implement simple strategies to minimise their impact.",Article,0 , Refugee Survey Quarterly,,1,"

The logic of industrial capitalism versus the logic of Inuit thinking – denied interconnectedness and how it inhibits broad-based action in the human rights and environmental spaces,['Joseph Alizzi'],"This article is a preliminary examination on the experience of relation with physical and conceptual objects in space and how this relation generally affects broad-based action in regard to human rights violations or environmental exploitation. The article suggests that a felt awareness arising from an understanding of interconnectedness is often inhibited or obscured due to an inscribed logic emanating from industrial capitalism. This logic broadly dominates the individual and commonly shared spaces, and creates a distance that inhibits a felt relation with the life-sustaining aspects of objects from developing. The article explores how humans construct value and a commensurate morality towards objects, and how the neoliberal logic suppressing notions of interconnectedness is inhibiting the capacity of the institutional human rights and environmental domains to engender broad-based action. The article critiques this logic by drawing on logic emanating from indigenous spaces, where certain indigenous ways of object- imagining and relation more clearly reveal social and environmental interconnectedness, providing instructive lessons on the connection between a felt relation and responsiveness.

However, use of this method in Australia is low. To better understand women’s views and experiences of the female condom, we conducted an interventional cross-sectional study. Methods Cisgender women ≥16 years, heterosexually active and living in New South Wales were recruited through social media advertisements and email invitations to clients of a family planning service. Eligible participants were provided with three female condoms and invited to complete a follow-up survey. Survey responses for women who attempted to use at least one female condom were summarised using counts and proportions. Results We recruited 556 women; few (30/556) had used the female condom before the study. There were 284 women who used, or attempted to use, a female condom during the study and completed the follow-up survey. Fifty-one percent (104/205) reported experiencing some difficulty in insertion, although only 46% (130/284) had seen an instructional demonstration. Approximately half (105/204) of women rated the sensation and comfort of the female condom as the same or better than the male condom, and 66% (137/204) reported that it provided the same or better lubrication. Approximately half of women said they would consider using the female condom again for STI prevention (51% (133/260)) or contraception (40% (103/260)), or would recommend to others (43% (112/260)). Conclusion Findings highlight the need for increased health promotion and education regarding use of the female condom. To increase access it will be important to address method cost and availability in Australia.

Stranded at Sea: Photographic Representations of the Rohingya in the 2015 Bay of Bengal Crisis,"['Jenny Yeung', 'Caroline Lenette']","Visual representations can contribute to shaping how the general public perceives and engages with issues of forced migration. In 2015, thousands of Rohingya became stranded in the Bay of Bengal when smugglers abandoned them on unseaworthy boats and regional governments refused their disembarkation. Their ordeal made headlines across the globe and photographs documenting the crisis were widely disseminated. This paper applies visual-social semiotics to four of these photographs from an Agence France-Presse public exhibition. Our analysis suggests that the features in the photographs transcend the conventional “threat versus victim” dualism that typically characterizes such representations, to capture both the suffering and agency of the people at the centre of the crisis. This occurs in two ways: first, the Rohingya are depicted as proactive and enacting agency, and not just as powerless people in need of rescue. Second, the juxtaposition of mundane aspects with more dramatic frames offers a tangible pathway for viewers to connect with the circumstances of the people depicted. These visual representations were effective in triggering international concern and policy responses in 2015. However, such photographs’ longer-term potential for shifting public perceptions of displacement and forced migration—and by extension, effective policy measures—remains largely indeterminate.",Article,8 , Qualitative Report,,0,"

The Latent Digital Divides and Its Drivers in E-Learning: Among Bangladeshi Student During COVID-19 Pandemic,"['Md Badiuzzaman', 'Md. Rafiquzzaman', 'Md Insiat Islam Rabby', 'Mohammad Mustaneer Rahman']","The devastating COVID-19 pandemic forced academia to go virtual. Educational institutions around the world have stressed online learning programs in the aftermath of the pandemic. However, because of insufficient access to ICT, a substantial number of students failed to harness the opportunity of online learning. This study explores the latent digital divide exhibited during the COVID-19 pandemic while online learning activities are emphasized among Bangladeshi students. It also investigates the digital divide exposure and the significant underlying drivers of the divide. A cross-sectional survey was employed to collect quantitative data mixed with open-ended questions to collect qualitative information from the student community. The findings revealed that despite the majority of students have physical access to ICT but only 32.5% of students could attend online classes seamlessly, 34.1% of the students reported the data prices as the critical barrier, and 39.8% of students identified the poor network infrastructure is the significant barrier for them to participate in online learning activities. Although most students possess physical access to the device and the Internet, they face the first-level digital divide due to the quality of access and maintaining subscriptions. Consequently, they fail to take advantage of physical access, resulting in the third-level digital divide (Utility Gap) and submerging them into a digital divide cycle. This paper aimed to explore the underlying issues of the digital divide among Bangladeshi students to assist relevant stakeholders (e.g., the Bangladesh government, Educational Institutions, Researchers) in providing the necessary insights and theoretical understanding to arrange adequate su

"""I need you all to understand how pervasive this issue is"": User efforts to regulate child sexual offending on social media","['Michael Salter', 'Elly Hanson']","This chapter examines the phenomenon of internet users attempting to report and prevent online child sexual exploitation (CSE) and child sexual abuse material (CSAM) in the absence of adequate intervention by internet service providers, social media platforms, and government. The chapter discusses the history of online CSE, focusing on regulatory stances over time in which online risks to children have been cast as natural and inevitable by the hegemony of a “cyber-libertarian” ideology. We illustrate the success of this ideology, as well as its profound contradictions and ethical failures, by presenting key examples in which internet users have taken decisive action to prevent online CSE and promote the removal of CSAM. Rejecting simplistic characterizations of “vigilante justice,” we argue instead that the fact that often young internet users are being forced to act against online CSE and CSAM puts a lie to libertarian claims that internet regulation is impossible, unworkable, and unwanted. Recent shifts towards a more progressive ethos of online harm minimization are promising, however, this ethos risks offering a new legitimizing ideology for online business models that will continue to put children at risk of abuse and exploitation. In conclusion, we suggest ways forward toward an internet built in the interests of children, rather than profit.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Cambridge Review of International Affairs ISSN: (Print) ( Brazilian foreign policy under Jair Bolsonaro: far- right populism and the rejection of the liberal international order Brazilian foreign policy under Jair Bolsonaro: far-right populism and the rejection of the liberal international order,"['Déborah BL Farias', 'Leal Farias', 'Paixão E Casarões[...]', 'Guilherme Casarões']","This paper engages with debates over the Liberal International Order (LIO) and Latin America by focusing on Brazil. More specifically, it addresses President Jair Bolsonaro's foreign policy. His radical-right populist and religious-infused approach has been characterized by an explicit rejection of practically all elements of the LIO, including multilateralism, multiculturism, and regionalism-historically core features of Brazilian foreign policy. We seek to answer two interrelated questions: (1) what were the political conditions-domestic and international-that allowed for such dramatic foreign policy change? (2) what impact is Brazil's new foreign policy orientation having on the LIO? To address them, we resort to the aspirational constructivist theory, which has allowed us to theorize Brazil's new identity formation. We argue that Bolsonaro has reshaped Brazil's foreign policy as part of his endeavour to create a national self-image based on three pillars: anti-globalism, anti-Communism, and religious nationalism. By doing so, the Bolsonaro administration has transformed Brazil, otherwise an avid supporter of the LIO, into one of the order's most vocal critics. While anti-globalism (and, subsidiarily, anti-Communism) undermines the normative and institutional foundations of the LIO, religious nationalism offers a replacement to the order, based on independent ethno-nationalist communities. If Brazil's radical right populist model spreads across Latin America, it has the potential to hollow out the region's support to the LIO.",Article,1 , Cambridge Review of International Affairs,,0,"

The role of mobile technology in promoting social inclusion among adults with intellectual disabilities,"['Andrew J Martin', 'Iva Strnadová', 'Julie Loblinzk[...]', 'Therese M Cumming']","Background: Mobile technology has the potential to assist adults with intellectual disabilities to initiate and maintain social connections in important areas of their lives, such as family, friends and work/volunteering. Method: The present study investigated how specific aspects of mobile device/app use are associated with the social inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities. The study also examined what background attributes were associated with particular patterns of mobile device/app use and social inclusion. Results: The findings revealed that the use of mobile technology among adults with intellectual disabilities was positively associated with their social inclusion with family, friends and work/volunteering. There were also some key background attributes associated with participants' use of mobile technology and the extent to which mobile technology assisted their social inclusion. Conclusions: Implications for practice and policy are discussed.",Article,1 , Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disabilities,,0,"

Oiling the Rigs of State-building: A Political Settlements Analysis of Petroleum Revenue Management in Timor-Leste,"['Dahlia Simangan', 'Srinjoy Bose']","Timor-Leste’s extractive industry became economically and politically important during the post-conflict transition period. The government established the Petroleum Fund in 2005 to protect the economy from a “resource curse.” However, the management of the Fund has since become a source of controversy as it created opportunities for corruption and unsustainable spending practices. We argue in this article that political dynamics, in addition to if not more than weak institutions, engendered corruption, clientelist rule, and economic disenfranchisement in postconflict Timor-Leste. Using the Political Settlements approach as an analytical framework, we demonstrate that patronage, rivalry, and rent seeking in the management of petroleum revenues are associated with economic and political challenges in Timor-Leste’s state-building process.",Article,,,,0,"

Teaching for diversity: university educators’ accounts of care work and emotional labour with CALD students,"['Sally Baker', 'Clemence Due', 'Prasheela Karan', 'Megan Rose']","The massification of higher education has resulted in a highly diverse student body. Within this expansion, the increased number of Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) students has unquestionably enriched university campuses, but has also brought challenges for teaching and learning within higher education systems. There are limited accounts in the scholarly literature with regard to university educators’ perspectives of their teaching and students. In particular, limited attention has been paid to the care-related and emotional dimensions of teaching diverse cohorts. Through a mixed-method study of university educators, this paper provides a thematic analysis of university educators’ experiences of teaching CALD students, including their reflections on students’ specific needs, the existing supports offered and suggestions as to what supports are needed. It considers the visibility of the care work and emotional labour educators undertake, and problematises how this work is created by institutional assumptions but rarely recognised as legitimate ‘work’.",Article,1 , Teaching in Higher Education,,0,"

The Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights of Young People with Intellectual Disability: A Scoping Review,"['Allison Carter', 'Iva Strnadová', 'Chloe Watfern[...]', 'Christy E Newman']","IntroductionWe examined the breadth of research on sex, sexuality, and sexual and reproductive health and rights with young people with intellectual disability in the past two decades.Methods An inclusive scoping approach focused on agency and resilience was used to review studies in English-speaking, high-income countries (2000–2019).ResultsIn the 68 studies included, we found positive examples of sexual and reproductive agency across five key domains: 1) sexual development including sexual desire, identities, relationships, and menstruation, 2) sexual knowledge including sexuality education and sexual self-advocacy, 3) sexual activity and contraceptive use, 4) access to HPV immunization and cervical cancer screening, and 5) pregnancy, childbirth, and parenthood. The strongest factors in enabling agency were social support and sexuality education. However, several barriers including paternalist attitudes and infantilization of young people with intellectual disability affected all aspects of sexual expression, leading to the persistence of unfair and avoidable health inequities over the past two decades.Conclusions Ensuring young people with intellectual disability have a voice on all matters affecting their bodies, even if they have high support needs, is essential to promoting sexual and reproductive health and rights for all.Policy ImplicationsAnti-ableist policies in sexual and reproduction health (e.g., education curriculum, service delivery) are key to moving forward.",Article,1 , Sexuality Research and Social Policy,,1,"

Beyond deficit: ‘strengths‐based approaches’ in Indigenous health research,"['Joanne Bryant', 'Reuben Bolt', 'Jessica R Botfield[...]', 'Peter Aggleton']","Health research concerning Indigenous peoples has been strongly characterised by deficit discourse—a ‘mode of thinking’ that is overly focused on risk behaviours and problems. Strengths‐based approaches offer a different perspective by promoting a set of values that recognise the capacities and capabilities of Indigenous peoples. In this article, we seek to understand the conceptual basis of strengths‐based approaches as currently presented in health research. We propose that three main approaches exist: ‘resilience’ approaches concerned with the personal skills of individuals; ‘social–ecological’ approaches, which focus on the individual, community and structural aspects of a person's environment; and ‘sociocultural’ approaches, which view ‘strengths’ as social relations, collective identities and practices. We suggest that neither ‘resilience’ nor ‘social–ecological’ approaches sufficiently problematise deficit discourse because they remain largely informed by Western concepts of individualised rationality and, as a result, rest on logics that support notions of absence and deficit. In contrast, sociocultural approaches tend to view ‘strengths’ not as qualities possessed by individuals, but as the structure and character of social relations, collective practices and identities. As such, they are better able to capture Indigenous ways of knowing and being and provide a stronger basis on which to build meaningful interventions.",Literature Review,1 , Sociology of Health & Illness,Jun 21,0,"

Evidence supporting the Egestion-Salivation Hypothesis for inoculation of Xylella fastidiosa by sharpshooter vectors,"['Elaine Backus', 'Kim Andrews', 'John M. Labavitch', 'Carl Greve']","Despite more than 70 years of study, the mechanism of inoculation of semipersistent, foregut-borne plant pathogens by their vectors is still unknown. The best model system for these studies is inoculation of the Pierces disease bacterium, Xylella fastidiosa (Xf), by vectors such as the glassy-winged sharpshooter GWSS). Research on the egestion-salivation hypothesis for Xf inoculation is presented. Two important steps in this hypothesis are: 1) uptake of saliva containing the cell wall-degrading enzyme beta-1,4 glucanase into the vectors precibarium, causing the Xf colonies attached therein to loosen from the cuticle, followed by 2) injection of saliva containing loosened bacteria into the xylem prior to ingestion. To directly test the likelihood that Xf could survive in and migrate out of saliva following inoculation, immunohistology was used to study interactions between Xf and GWSS saliva in grapevine. Adult GWSS were confined in small cages on grapevine stems for 24 hours and allowed to probe, leaving salivary sheaths in the plant. Xf was then needle-inoculated into the same stem area; 1 hour later, the tissue was excised and prepared for immunohistology using a commercial Xf probe. Xf bacteria observed in xylem cells penetrated the semi-viscous saliva deposited during GWSS probing prior to Xf inoculation. Therefore, Xf bacteria have the ability to infiltrate gelled saliva containing salivary glucanase. Implications for the mechanism of inoculation are discussed.",Conference Paper,,,,0,"

The Trichan takedown: Lessons in the governance and regulation of child sexual abuse material,['Michael Salter'],"en Amidst renewed concern about the prevalence of online child sexual abuse material, the global technology sector is refocusing on models of multistakeholder governance and the development of new technological solutions. This paper argues that the language of multistakeholderism and technological solutionism obscures the administrative and commercial practices that facilitate the widespread distribution of abuse material. To illustrate this point, the paper describes the 2019 intervention of the Canadian Centre for Child Protection in the operations of “Trichan”, three websites that were amongst the largest purveyors of abuse material on the open web for 7 years. The case study underscores the materiality of the Internet and the role of commercial relations within the infrastructure stack in the provision of illegal content. While identifying opportunities for the mass removal of abuse material, the paper questions the discretion granted to technology companies under laissez faire regulation, and troubles characterizations of Internet infrastructure as neutral and instrumental factors in the epidemic availability of abuse material. 摘要 zh 在有关网络儿童性虐待内容盛行的新一轮关切中，全球科技部门正重新聚焦于多利益攸关方治理的模式和新技术解决措施的发展。本文主张，多利益攸关方主义（multi‐stakeholderism）和技术解决主义（technological solutionism）的表达方式模糊了那些帮助广泛散布虐待内容的管理实践和商业实践。为阐明这一点，本文描述了2019年加拿大儿童保护中心在“Trichan”操作中的干预，Trichan是7年来开放网络（open

"The Origins of Football: History, Ideology and the Making of 'The People's Game'",['Gavin Kitching'],"Recent scholarship on the origins of association football has been marked by a highly ideological debate on its ‘class’ nature. The traditional story – of a game created by ‘gentlemen’ but taken up, and ultimately dominated, by ‘ruffians’ – has been challenged by a revisionist account which presents football as an ancient ‘people’s’ or ‘plebeian’ game, briefly hijacked by upper-middle class men in the mid-Victorian period, before returning to its ‘popular’ roots from the 1880s onwards. This article suggests that, as currently conducted, the debate is both conceptually confused and bedevilled by paucity of sources. The conceptual problems derive partly from an endemic vagueness in the historical use of the term ‘football’, and partly from a persistent tendency to conflate football play with rules of play. The paucity of sources is well-known in the study of football as a medieval and early modern folk pastime. But it is also an issue in studying early forms of club football. This article uses a hitherto underused source – the match reports of the earliest amateur football clubs in Britain – as part of an attempt to address the conceptual confusion and also to present a genuinely new account of the impact of traditional ‘folk’ football on the modern game. It is suggested that the impact was both real and very short-lived.",Article,5 , History Workshop Journal,3d ago,1,"

Can Cameron Capture Women's Votes?

Subsequently, the Conservative Party leadership intensified efforts to attract women voters through recruiting more women MPs and in its policy messages and proposals and in 2005 and 2010 the gender gap was largely neutralised. However, in the contestation for women's votes at the next election we argue Conservative strategies are hampered by weaknesses in their symbolic, descriptive and substantive representation of women and they are unlikely to restore the Party's historical dominance with women voters with potentially serious consequences for the likelihood of a Conservative majority.",Article,4 , Parliamentary Affairs,,0,"

Opportunities for drowning interventions using existing government policy and programmes in India,"['Medhavi Gupta', 'Anthony Zwi', 'J Jagnoor']","Background Children living in coastal, rural India face a particularly high risk of drowning due to rurality, presence of open water, lack of accessible health systems and poor infrastructure. No drowning interventions are currently implemented in India. Interventions that build on existing policy targets or government programs are more likely to be sustainable and scalable. Methods For the first time to our knowledge for an injury-related issue in India, detailed content review of policy was conducted to identify both policy principles and/or specific government programs that may be leveraged for drowning interventions. The reach, enablers and barriers of these programs were assessed through a systematic literature review. Identified policies and programs were also assessed on how they catered for underserved groups and took into consideration equity. Results Three programs may be leveraged for drowning interventions: The Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), Self-Help Group (SHG) and Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) programs. All three had high coverage and considered underserved groups such as women and rural populations. Conclusions Programs targeting specific health outcomes should consider interventions outside of the health sector that address social determinants of health. This may enable the program to better align with relevant government agendas and increase sustainability. Key messages This is the first systematic analysis of both policy content and execution of government programs to provide comprehensive insights into possible implementation strategies for an injury intervention.

Less is known about the wider sense of security experienced by clients of such services as a counterbalance to social marginality in their daily lives. As part of a larger study of the experience of violence among Australian men, the authors completed 20 qualitative semi-structured interviews with male clients of Sydney’s Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC) in 2016–2020. These were conducted anonymously in a private clinical room inside the MSIC and focused on aspects of drug use and general life experiences of violence, law enforcement, safety and security. Interviews were analysed by thematic content through a combination of preliminary and second close readings. Our analysis found that the MSIC consistently acted as a reprieve from harassment and violence from police and members of the public, conflict in drug deals, and general social exclusion.",Article,1 , International Journal for Crime Justice and Social Democracy,Dec 15,0,"

“What’s Mum’s Password?”: Australian Mothers’ Perceptions of Children’s Involvement in Technology-Facilitated Coercive Control,"['Molly Dragiewicz', 'Delanie Woodlock', 'Michael Salter', 'Bridget Harris']","This is the first article to analyze children’s involvement in technology-facilitated coercive control in Australia. The primary research question was ‘‘How do mothers describe their children’s involvement in technology-facilitated coercive control?”. This article is based on incidental findings from a larger study on Australian women’s experiences of technology-facilitated abuse in the context of domestic violence. Although children were not the focus of the study, semi-structured interviews with twelve mothers yielded discussion of children’s involvement in the abuse. We used thematic analysis to identify key dynamics and contexts of this abuse. We found that mothers and their children are co-victims of coercive control. Mothers interviewed for the study reported that children were involved in technology-facilitated coercive control directly and indirectly. This study bridges the gap between the extant research on children and coercive control and technology-facilitated abuse by highlighting the ways children are involved in technology-facilitated coercive control. The social and legal contexts of co-parenting with abusive fathers exposed mothers and children to ongoing post-separation abuse, extending abusive fathers’ absent presence in the lives of children",Article,1 , Journal of Family Violence,Jun 11,0,"

Drawing on Aboriginal trauma scholarship and decolonizing methodologies, this paper situates the contemporary state removal of Aboriginal children against the backdrop of historical policies that actively sought to disrupt Aboriginal kinship and communities. The paper draws on submissions to the 2018 Australian Senate Parliamentary Inquiry into Adoption Reform from Aboriginal community controlled organizations and highlights four common themes evident throughout these submissions: (i) the role of intergenerational trauma in high rates of Aboriginal child removal; (ii) the place of children within Aboriginal culture, kinship and identity; (iii) the centrality of the principles of self-determination and autonomy for Aboriginal communities and (iv) Aboriginal community controlled alternatives to child removal. Acknowledging the failure of both federal and state reforms to address the issues raised in these submissions, the paper reflects on the marginalization of Aboriginal voices and solutions within contemporary efforts to address the multiple crises of the child protection system and the implications for the future of Aboriginal children.",Article,1 , Child & Family Social Work,Jul 26,0,"

"Emotions, De/Attachment, and the Digital Archive: Reading Violence at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY)",['Caitlin Biddolph'],"The study of global politics is not an exercise in objectivity and rationality, but one that is embodied, personal, and deeply affective.

In addition to feminist contributions, the emotional turn in IR has seen the emergence of vibrant scholarship exploring the role of emotions in sites and processes of global politics, as well as the role of emotions in the research process. In this article, I aim to contribute to this growing body of scholarship by speaking to these and other questions that explore the role of emotions in researchers’ engagement with their work.

Women and Stigma: A Protocol for Understanding Intersections of Experience through Body Mapping,"['Katherine Boydell', 'Jill Bennett', 'Angela Helen Dew[...]', 'Ruth Wells']","This paper outlines a research and dissemination protocol to be undertaken with specific groups of marginalised women in Australia. Women impacted by significant mental distress, disability, or refugee status are among society’s most vulnerable and disenfranchised groups. They can experience significant social exclusion, marginalisation and stigma, associated with reduced help seeking, deprivation of dignity and human rights, and threats to health, well-being and quality of life. Previous research has assessed the experiences of discrete groups of women but has to date failed to consider mental health–refugee–disability intersections and overlaps in experience. Using body mapping, this research applies an intersectional approach to identify how women impacted by significant mental distress, disability, and refugee status negotiate stigma and marginalisation. Findings on strategies to cope with, negotiate and resist stigmatised identities will inform health policy and yield targeted interventions informed by much-needed insights on women’s embodied experience of stigma. The women’s body maps will be exhibited publicly as part of an integrated knowledge translation strategy.

Queering crimes of torture: A (re)imagining of torture in International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia jurisprudence,['Caitlin Biddolph'],"International criminal justice mechanisms are guided by their mandates to hold individuals accountable for grave breaches of international humanitarian law. Within this body of law, a host of crimes are listed as prohibited, and if committed, could land individuals before national or international courts. While the legal categorisation of violence into discrete crimes serves the procedural justice of the courtroom, it simultaneously erases the overlapping, entangled, and messy practice of violence. In this paper, I engage in a queer (re)imagining of the legal category of the crime of torture, as defined and practiced at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). A queer reading of witness testimonies reveals the multiplicities and contingencies that constitute torture, but also exposes the logics of gender and sexuality that make the practice and prosecution of torture legible. I argue that the ICTY jurisprudence both erases and embraces the complicated ways that torture is practiced and embodied. A queer reading of this case offers opportunities to expand definitions and applications of torture in contemporary mechanisms of international criminal justice.",Article,1 , Australian Journal of Human Rights,,0,"

Yet, despite the global attention afforded to #MeToo, it was preceded by numerous initiatives, which we argue created digital footprints instrumental in rendering #MeToo intelligible. As such, the aim of this article is two-fold. Firstly, it offers the first attempt to map a diverse range of initiatives which have mobilized to fight sexual violence, and in doing so, makes visible the global genealogy of digital feminist activism responding to sexualised violence. Secondly, building on these digital footprints and looking towards the future of digital feminist activism, the article demonstrates the power and potential of initiatives that expose the structural conditions enabling sexual violence to occur through the collective sharing of experiences across cybernetworks via processes of “ethical witnessing.” We conclude by advocating for greater recognition of those voices and experiences that feminist scholars and activists alike continue to fail to witness and call for greater efforts to archive the genealogy of digital feminist mobilisation in order to capture the complexity and diversity of its past, present and future.",Article,1 , Feminist Media Studies,,0,"

Queering temporalities of international criminal justice: Srebrenica remembrance and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY),['Caitlin Biddolph'],"The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY, or the Tribunal) completed its mandate in 2017, marking the end of its 24-year lifespan. While the ICTY has officially ceased operations, the implications of the Tribunal’s closure continue to manifest in contemporary settings of transitional justice. Embracing a queer approach to time, the ICTY can be better understood as temporally fluid, open, and contested, rather than confined to its establishment and closure. This is because as a site for the (re)production and (re)presentation of discourses, the ICTY transcends temporal boundaries, continuing to shape and constitute (post-)conflict and transitional contexts. In this paper, I deploy queer approaches to time to interrogate how discourses of gender, sexuality, and violence at the ICTY traverse legal-political temporalities. Using the Tribunal’s Srebrenica remembrance as a case study, I demonstrate how gendered and sexualised logics constituted at the ICTY exceed the Tribunal’s official temporal mandate. Adopting a queer approach to time, I argue that gendered memories of violence at the ICTY permeate temporalities of international justice and global politics.",Article,1 , Griffith Law Review,,0,"

"Carnival, Sexual Violence and Harm at Australian Music Festivals","['Phillip Wadds', 'Bianca Fileborn', 'Stephen Tomsen']","Much has been written about the search for carnivalesque release in late-modern society, but relatively less attention has been paid to the harms experienced within this practice.

The paper examines the way in which situational, environmental and gendered dynamics shape these transgressive experiences. In doing so, it advances cultural criminological understandings of the carnivalesque by highlighting the bounded nature of carnival and the ‘cultural scaffolding’ that enables sexual violence and harassment at music festival events.",Article,1 , British Journal of Criminology,,0,"

Pragmatic strategies to reduce the digital divide in the online class and improve interaction to increase outcomes,"['Md Badiuzzaman', 'Mohammad Mustaneer Rahman']","Online classes are becoming increasingly popular in this technological era and, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become the mainstream practise (UN, 2020). Due to the unprecedented health risks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, 188 nations across the globe have implemented a safety regulation prohibiting direct instruction in educational institutions. Most countries have adopted online classes as a substitute for traditional face-to-face classes (Petretto et al., 2020). This indicates that perhaps this pandemic will lead to long-term reformation in the future education system, making online learning-teaching an integral part of traditional education in the future. For example, according to the UN (2020), numerous higher education programs have successfully been implemented online. According to UN (2020) data, approximately all European and Latin American countries have adopted online learning amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, approximately 60% of African countries have introduced online learning, which is significantly lower. Although online classes seemly effective, this introduces new forms of inequalities (Badiuzzaman et al., 2021; Petretto et al., 2020; UNESCO, 2020). UNESCO has warned that considering online learning as the way ahead for everyone is a delusion (UNESCO, 2020). Empirical evidence found that many students are deprived of onlineclasses in developing countries due to various forms of the digital divide (Badiuzzaman et al., 2021; UN, 2020). Along with these digital divide issues, lack of interaction in class, lack of technical skills of teachers and students, dearth of parental awareness cumulatively affecting the utility of online classes.

Australia and the Rules of International Trade and Finance,['Elizabeth Thurbon'],"Throughout the second half of the Twentieth Century, Australia was a fierce advocate and defender of the multilateral rules-based economic order. Since the early 2000s however, the Australian government has privileged the pursuit of preferential trade and investment agreements, and now sees the pursuit of preferential deals as central to the advancement of its broader foreign policy goals. In this chapter, I assess Australia's contribution to the rules-based international order in trade and finance from the end of WWII to the present. I also examine the relationship between Australia's trade and investment policy approach and its broader foreign policy objectives by asking: are the economic rules Australia is promoting likely to advance or undermine its stated foreign policy goals? My aim is to advance debate about the most desirable future direction of Australia's foreign economic policy agenda.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Re-examining the gap: A critical realist analysis of eye health inequity among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians,"['Aryati Yashadhana', 'Ted Fields', 'Anthea Burnett', 'Anthony Zwi']","The prevalence of diabetes among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter ‘Aboriginal’) Australians is three times greater than non-Aboriginal Australians, contributing to a greater risk of blindness from treatable and preventable ocular conditions, most prominently cataract and diabetic retinopathy. In rural and remote Aboriginal communities, blindness prevalence is higher, and ocular treatment coverage and uptake are lower. In collaboration with Aboriginal Community Based Researchers (CBRs), this study explored complex contingent factors that shape access to eye health services for rural and remote Aboriginal Australians living with diabetes. Interviews (n = 126) and focus groups (n = 12) were conducted with patients, primary care clinicians, and CBRs, in four rural communities in the Northern Territory and New South Wales. Factors internal and external to health systems were examined, drawing on Bourdieu's concepts of habitus, and doxa to understand agency and decision-making among patients and clinicians. The study used the ontology of critical realism, categorising contingent factors as underlying structures (generative mechanisms), and applying a decolonising approach that centred causal relationships and tensions between dominant (Western biomedical neoliberalism) and non-dominant (Aboriginal) value systems. Three forms of marginalisation; linguistic, economic, and cultural, were identified as the generative mechanisms that inhibit equitable eye health outcomes. Marginality is linked to structural factors that position Aboriginal culture as a barrier, and is reinforced through biomedical health systems, and the agents who operate in and influence them. In order to address eye health inequity, a shift in how

‘To the Arabic Community Disability Is Not Normal’: Multiple Stakeholder Perceptions of the Understandings of Disability among Iraqi and Syrian People from Refugee Backgrounds,"['Angela Helen Dew', 'Caroline Lenette', 'Louisa Smith[...]', 'Yasir Mohammad']","In 2015, the Australian government committed to take an additional 12,000 refugees from Syria and Iraq prioritizing those considered most vulnerable including people with disability. The aim of this preliminary study was to understand, from multiple stakeholder perspectives, the experiences of settling in Australia for people with disability from Syrian and Iraqi refugee backgrounds living in Sydney. Interviews were conducted with nine family members of 11 people with disability from Iraqi and Syrian refugee backgrounds; eight Iraqi and Syrian community organization leaders; and seven community and health refugee service practitioners. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using the thematic analysis. Three themes were identified that contribute to understandings of disability based on the perceptions of the multiple stakeholders interviewed: Iraqi and Syrian perceptions of ‘disability’; beliefs about who is ‘responsible for’ the disability; and comparisons between Iraqi/Syrian and Australian views, attitudes, and approaches to disability. Understandings of disability are shaped by fluid and dynamic factors, including culture. It is essential that services are offered to people with disability and their family members using a whole-of-person, culturally informed approach to community support.",Article,0 , Journal of Refugee Studies,"Dec 26, 2020",0,"

‘In the Beginning is Relation’: Martin Buber’s Alternative to Binary Oppositions,"['Andrew Metcalfe', 'Ann Game']","In this article we develop a relational understanding of sociality, that is, an account of social life that takes relation as primary. This stands in contrast to the common assumption that relations arise when subjects interact, an account that gives logical priority to separation. We will develop this relational understanding through a reading of the work of Martin Buber, a social philosopher primarily interested in dialogue, meeting, relationship, and the irreducibility and incomparability of reality. In particular, the article contrasts Buber’s work with that of poststructuralist theorists who take as their starting point the deconstruction of the Hegelian logic of binary oppositions. Deconstruction understands difference as the excess that undoes the binary, but Buber, we argue, shows how difference derives from the primacy and ontological undefinability of relation. Relational logic does not exclude the logic of separations and oppositions: relation is the primal ground that makes separations possible.",Article,1 , Sophia,Nov 15,0,"

“It ain’t a compliment”: Feminist data visualisation and digital street harassment advocacy,"['Bianca Fileborn', 'Verity Trott']","In an era of datafication, data visualisation is playing an increasing role in civic meaning-making processes. However, the conventions of data visualisation have been criticised for their reductiveness and rhetoric of neutrality and there have been recent efforts to develop feminist principles for designing data visualisations that are compatible with feminist epistemologies. In this article, we aim to examine how data visualisation is used in feminist activism and by feminist activists. Drawing on the example of digital street harassment activism, we analyse how street harassment is visualised in and through a selection of prominent activist social media accounts. We consider the platform affordances utilised by activists, and how these are harnessed in making street harassment ‘knowable'. Moreover, we critically interrogate which and whose experiences are ‘knowable’ via digital techniques, and what remains obscured and silenced. In analysing digital feminist activists’ practices, we argue that what constitutes ‘data visualisation’ itself must be situated within feminist epistemologies and praxis that centre lived experience as the starting point for knowledge production. Such an approach challenges and disrupts normative constructions of what constitutes data visualisation. Our findings demonstrate how feminist activists are adopting ‘traditional’ practices of speaking out and consciousness-raising to the digital sphere in the creation of a range of visualisations that represent the issue of street harassment. We consider the efficacy of these visualisations for achieving their intended purpose and how they might translate to policy and government responses, if this is indeed their goal. Further, we document a tension between feminis

information The Latent Digital Divide and Its Drivers in E-Learning among Bangladeshi Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"['Md Badiuzzaman', 'Md. Rafiquzzaman', 'Md Insiat Islam Rabby', 'Mohammad Mustaneer Rahman']","The devastating COVID-19 pandemic forced academia to go virtual. Educational institutions around the world have stressed online learning programs in the aftermath of the pandemic. However, because of insufficient access to Information Communication Technology (ICT), a substantial number of students failed to harness the opportunity of online learning. This study explores the latent digital divide exhibited during the COVID-19 pandemic while online learning activities are emphasised among students of Bangladesh. It also investigates the digital divide exposure and the significant underlying drivers of the divide. In order to accomplish this, a cross-sectional survey was employed to collect quantitative data, mixed with open-ended questions were utilised to gather qualitative information from the student community. The findings revealed that despite the majority of students having physical access to ICT, only 32.5% of students could attend online classes seamlessly. In total, 34.1% reported data prices as the critical barrier, while 39.8% identified poor network infrastructure as the significant barrier preventing them from participating in online learning activities. Although most students possess physical access to various devices and the Internet, they face the first-level digital divide due to the quality of access and price of cellular Internet. Consequently, they fail to take advantage of physical access, resulting in the third-level digital divide (utility gap), which submerges them into a digital divide cycle. The primary objective of this study is to explore the underlying issues of the digital divide among Bangladeshi students.

Treatment of opioid dependence with depot buprenorphine (CAM2038) in custodial settings,"['Adrian Dunlop', 'Bethany White', 'Jillian Roberts[...]', 'Nicholas Lintzeris']","Background and aims Opioid agonist treatment is effective but resource intensive to administer safely in custodial settings, leading to significant under-treatment of opioid dependence in these settings worldwide. This study assessed the safety of subcutaneous slow-release depot buprenorphine in custody. Design Open-label, non-randomised trial. Setting Correctional centres in New South Wales, Australia. Participants Sixty-seven men and women, aged≥18 years of various security classifications with a diagnosis of moderate to severe DSM-5 opioid use disorder currently serving a custodial sentence of ≥6 months were recruited between November 2018 and July 2019. Patients not in opioid agonist treatment at recruitment commenced depot buprenorphine; patients already stable on oral methadone treatment were recruited to the comparison arm. Intervention and comparator Depot buprenorphine (CAM2038 weekly for 4 weeks then monthly) and daily oral methadone. Measurements Safety was assessed by adverse event (AE) monitoring and physical examinations at every visit. Participants were administered a survey assessing self-reported diversion and substance use at baseline, week 4 and week 16. Findings Retention in depot buprenorphine treatment was 92%. Ninety-four percent of patients reported at least one adverse event, typically mild and transient. No diversion was identified. The prevalence of self-reported non-prescribed opioid use among depot buprenorphine patients decreased significantly between baseline (97%) and week 16 (12%, OR=0.0035, 95% CI 0.0007-0.018, p<0.0001).

How not to think about the state and religious recognition,['Geoffrey Brahm Levey'],"Bouke De Vries opposes the constitutional recognition of one religion. This typically, though not always, involves the constitutional recognition of the religion shared by the historically dominant group in a society, a recognition not given to minority religions. De Vries’ objection to 'mono-recognition' is not, however, the usual arguments levelled against it. Rather, he claims to offer a novel argument showing that mono-recognition is ‘pro tanto wrong’, that is, wrong as far as it goes and until it can be otherwise justified. His argument is that it is enough that some citizens desire constitutional recognition for their religion on morally reasonable (or at least on not unreasonable) grounds for the non-recognition of their religion to be wrong. De Vries’ intervention is useful as a cautionary tale about how not to think about religious recognition and fairness in liberal democracies. It supplies three lessons. The first is that one should not try to resolve these issues in total disregard of a society’s history and culture. Lesson two is not to fixate on constitutional recognition as there are different ways of effecting political recognition and promoting a sense of belonging in a diverse society. Third, De Vries’ article inadvertently highlights the practical and moral dilemmas involved in trying to distribute recognition in a mechanical or uniform fashion. Assessing the legitimacy of the political recognition of religion and religious minorities requires a much more nuanced and context-sensitive approach than the one De Vries presents, a tiptoeing rather than a pro tantoing through the tulips.",Article,1 , Ethnicities,,0,"

This article focuses on one alternative pathway, ‘enabling’ education, which has a 45-year history in Australia but has, for a variety of reasons, remained on the periphery of mainstream discourses about higher education. In this article, we offer a meta-scoping study of a selection of 88 journal articles and research reports focusing on Australian Enabling education. Through an analysis of who is writing, what is written and how it is written, we attempt to unite enabling education scholars in a conversation about our field and suggest ways forward to better connect with broader conversations about higher education in Australia and move enabling programs, practitioners and the students they serve into the centre stage of Australia’s equity in higher education agenda.",Article,0 , Research Papers in Education,,0,"

KOMUNITI SEMPADAN BA’KELALAN: ANTARA IDENTITI NASIONAL DAN IDENTITI BUDAYA,"['Yusten Karulus', 'Maine Suadik']","Border communities, particularly in Southeast Asia have a similar identity before the formation of the modern nation state. The Treaty of Westphalia 1648 has separates nation state to various national identity (Chandler, 2003). With the establishment of national borders, collectives' identity among some ethnic groups has been divided into different national identity related to their nationalities. Based on these arguments, this paper discusses the tendency of identity among the border community of Ba'kelalan, Lawas in Sarawak. Ba'kelalan is located about four kilometers from the international border of Malaysia-Indonesia on the Malaysian side. The interaction among Lun Bawang or Lun Dayeh in Ba'kelalan, Malaysia and Long Bawan, Indonesia has been going on before the border formation in this area. The close cultural and historical ties between people on both sides of the border are one of the main reasons for the intense cross-border social and economic interactions. A general phenomenon and the dynamics of political identity have been used to examine the dominant factors of national and cultural identity in the context of cross border relations. Research has been done by using ethnographic approach to the 32 informants. 2 Findings show that cross border interaction in Ba'kelalan is conspicuously about maintaining their cultural identity. Specifically, the identity of being Lun Bawang as an ethnic group is more important than being Indonesian Lun Dayeh or Malaysian Lun Bawang. However, from the phenomenon of national identity, it shows that the sense of belonging among the Lun Bawang in Ba'kelalan is located on the Malaysian side-of being Malaysian",Article,,,,0,"

More 'Creative' Than 'Destructive'? Synthesizing Schumpeterian and Developmental State Perspectives to Explain Mixed Results in Korea's Clean Energy Shift,"['Elizabeth Thurbon', 'Sung-Young Kim', 'John A Mathews', 'Hao Tan']","We develop a new way of analyzing the state's strategic role in the clean energy shift. We do so by synthesizing Schumpeterian understandings of 'creative destruction' and techno-economic change with cutting-edge developmental state theorizing centred on 'developmental environmentalism'. Our approach allows us to explain South Korea's mixed results in the clean energy shift over the 2008-2020 period by focussing on varying degrees of alignment between the state's 'creative' and 'destructive' ambitions and capabilities. Following a period of misalignment characterized by a creative emphasis (2008-2015), we have seen growing alignment between the state's 'creative' and 'destructive' endeavours (2015-present). On the basis of our analysis, we anticipate that Korea's hitherto mixed results are likely to give way to more consistent strides towards greening the national economy. Beyond Korea, our fresh analytical approach may be applied to other national contexts, helping to advance broader debates about the state's strategic role in the clean energy shift.",Article,1 , The Journal of Environment & Development,May 20,0,"

Beyond Formal Ethics Reviews: Reframing the Potential Harms of Sexual Violence Research,"['Shaez Mortimer', 'Bianca Fileborn', 'Nicola Henry']","Given the recent surge of research about sexual violence, it is timely to revisit the role of ethics in this field. This article examines two key frameworks which govern ethics in sexual violence research: institutional risk management and trauma discourse. While recognising the importance of these frameworks, we argue that they share a narrow conceptualisation of the potential harms of sexual violence research. Drawing on the legacy of decades of feminist research on sexual violence, we call for a deeper engagement with ethical and epistemological questions of knowledge, positionality and power. We argue that researchers need to consider the broader social and political contexts that shape survivors’ lives and experiences of disclosure in undertaking ethical research. Sexual violence researchers must also consider the potential harms of their research on marginalised communities – from questioning who is included in research, to the implications of the responses to violence advocated for. Utilising insights from feminist, critical and intersectional traditions – and reflections on our own experiences as sexual violence researchers – we argue for ethical considerations to extend beyond risk management and medicalised trauma frameworks.",Article,1 , Australian Feminist Studies,Oct 29,0,"

Opportunities for strengthening sexual health education in schools: Findings from a student needs assessment in NSW,"['Caecilia Roth', 'Yan Cheng', 'Eleanor Wilson[...]', 'Jane Estoesta']","Issue Addressed Comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) is important for the sexual and reproductive health of young people. To better understand young people’s views and experiences of sexual health education in NSW, a student needs assessment survey was conducted in 2017. Methods This paper presents the findings from 1,603 NSW students in Years 8-12 following online recruitment. Descriptive analyses explored students’ views and experiences in relation to sources of sexual health information, education providers, school-based topics covered and resources drawn on. Results Findings indicate that school, parents, friends and social media are students’ most common sources of information on sexual and reproductive health. Approximately one-third of students reported wanting more information on topics related to relationships, reproductive health, consent and sexual decision-making and sexual harassment, abuse and bullying, and two-thirds of transgender and gender diverse students wanted more information on gender identity. For the topics which students reported receiving the least information about at school, they were most likely to seek this out on social media and websites. Conclusion Findings provide valuable insight for improving CSE in NSW. The influence of social media, parents and the internet should be taken into consideration when developing resources and programme content. Professional development for educators could contribute to improving the quality of CSE delivered. Accurate and up to date resources must be utilised to support student engagement and effective learning.",Article,1 , Health promotion journal of Australia: official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,,0,"

The human rights of older persons: the politics and substance of the UN Open-Ended Working Group on Ageing,['Annie Herro'],"Elder rights are the new frontier in the pluralisation of human rights yet they have been a largely neglected area of research. The United Nations (UN) has started to seriously consider establishing a Convention on the Rights of Older Persons through the Open-Ended Working Group on Ageing (OEWGA). Through qualitative and quantitative analyses of documents from the OEWGA and interviews with elder rights activists, this article examines the rights claims and subgroups of older persons that have been given primacy. It also identifies forces that have shaped the rights discourse and the implications of the dominant themes for how older persons are perceived. It argues that the political divisions and the rules of the OEWGA have prevented a consistently comprehensive discussion on the rights of older persons. It also argues that there is a risk that the emphasis on economic and social rights and older persons with disabilities by states and non-state actors might subtly reinforce the notion that elderly people are a drain on resources, a burden, and objects of welfare rather than as active contributors to societies. It concludes by proposing possible ways of avoiding these pitfalls and suggestions on widening the scope of the rights discussion and future research.",Article,7 , Australian Journal of Human Rights,,0,"

"The Struggle for Certainty: Ontological Security, the Rise of Nationalism, and Australia-China Tensions after COVID-19","['Guangyi Pan', 'Alexander Korolev']","Australia-China relations have been relatively stable over the last decade. However, soon after the outbreak of COVID-19, Australia took an increasingly assertive stance toward China, one that is arguably even more assertive than those of its Western allies. What prompted Australia to adopt a tougher policy against China? This article argues that COVID-19 has brought significant uncertainty to the international system and, hence, to Australia’s external environment, which has affected the country’s decision-making, accelerating the formation of a hardline policy toward China. A contributing factor behind this policy is Australia’s quest for ontological security, which, in the context of COVID-19, has triggered a rise in anti-China sentiment. Meanwhile, this strategy backfired when it encountered China’s own nationalism, which exacerbated the widening political chasm, dragging the two countries into an unprecedented diplomatic confrontation. The core of ontological security lies in maintaining the stability of the identity needed for the formation of consistent policy. The uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic have changed the familiar external environment and challenged Australia’s ability to interpret this new environment and adjust to it, which has triggered ontological insecurity. By analyzing Australia’s identity as a middle power in the context of changing regional security and its commitment to certain values, the article shows how COVID-19 has accelerated Australia’s quest for ontological security, which has changed the country’s China policy.",Article,1 , Journal of Chinese Political Science,Jan 5,1,"

Tissue-engineered nerve grafts using a scaffold-independent and injectable drug delivery system: a novel design with translational advantages,"['Yanxi Liu', 'Shuangjiang Yu', 'Xiaorong Gu[...]', 'Shusen Cui']","Objective: Currently commercially available nerve conduits have demonstrated suboptimal clinical efficacy in repairing peripheral nerve defects. Although tissue-engineered nerve grafts (TENGs) with sustained release of neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are experimentally proved to be more effective than these blank conduits, there remains a lack of clinical translation. NTFs are typically immobilized onto scaffold materials of the conduit via adsorption, specific binding or other incorporation techniques. These scaffold-based delivery strategies increase complexity and cost of conduit fabrication and lack flexibility in choosing different drugs. Therefore, to facilitate clinical translation and commercialization, we construct a TENG using a scaffold-independent drug delivery system (DDS). Approach: This study adopted a scaffold-independent DDS based on methoxy-poly (ethylene glycol)-b-poly(γ-ethyl-L-glutamate) (mPEG-PELG) thermosensitive hydrogels that undergo sol-to-gel transition at body temperature. In addition, TENG, a chitosan scaffold filled with nerve growth factor (NGF)-loaded mPEG-PELG that gel in the lumen upon injection during surgery and function as a drug-releasing conduit-filler, was designed. Subsequently, the efficacy of DDS and therapeutic effects of TENG were assessed. Main results: The results demonstrated that NGF-loaded mPEG-PELG controllably and sustainably released bioactive NGF for 28 d. When bridging a 10 mm rat sciatic nerve gap, the morphological, electrophysiological, and functional analyses revealed that NGF-releasing TENG (Scaffold + NGF/mPEG-PELG) achieved superior regenerative outcomes compared to plain scaffolds and those combined with systemi

Economic Anthropology in View of the Global Financial Crisis,['Timothy Heffernan'],"Economic anthropology is the study of how individuals and communities understand and engage with economic life, broadly conceived. This chapter provides an overview of central debates and approaches used in the subdiscipline over the past century. These debates – ranging from the form and substance of the economy, the impact of the cultural turn, and the rise of neoliberal economic policy – are explored amid changing relationships with credit and debt following the global financial crisis (GFC). Positioned between anthropology and economics, the field of economic anthropology has long sought to understand notions of exchange, ownership, consumption, value, reciprocity, production, and labor and considers how these relate to the function and maintenance of distinct cultural worlds. Analyzing central debates in historical perspective, this chapter asks how practitioners continue to engage with key ideas after the GFC. What is more, it decenters key theoretical approaches by examining the experience of the GFC from outside the global centers of finance. Through a case study of the Icelandic banking collapse as part of the GFC, questions of how credit and debt are understood in light of crisis are pursued, particularly after the collective prosperity of Iceland’s “economic miracle” in the early 2000s. It concludes with a discussion of the harms of neoliberalism and economic “virtualism” and charts emerging inquiries in economic anthropology that boast flexibility for examining economy in a changing world.",Chapter,,,Dec 13,0,"

This study aimed to determine health professional knowledge of the renewed screening program following implementation. Methods: We invited health professionals providing cervical screening in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, to complete an online survey in late 2018, to better understand their knowledge of the renewed screening guidelines, in particular regarding screening of specific populations, and to ascertain whether they had undertaken any educational activities relevant to the renewal. Results: A total of 241 responses were included in the data analysis. Health professionals demonstrated good knowledge of some aspects of the renewed program, including 64–85% correctly identifying limited indications for testing people younger than 25 years, 87% correctly identifying the need for completion of the Test of Cure protocol following treatment of high-grade lesions, and 71–80% correctly identifying management of symptomatic women. However several key knowledge gaps were identified including management of immune-deficient women (only 37% of respondents were aware of the need for 3-yearly screening), screening after total hysterectomy (56% were aware of guidance) and approximately 66% of health professionals correctly identifying indications for self-collected screening. One in ten health professionals had not undertaken any education specific to the renewal of the program.

Disaster Justice in Nepal's Earthquake Recovery,"['Krishna K. Shrestha', 'Basundhara Bhattarai', 'Hemant Ojha', 'Ayusha Bajracharya']","Many policies on disaster governance and community resilience aim at enhancing justice outcomes at the local community level. In so doing, they tend to focus on equal distribution of a set of rights and goods among the communities. However, these rights and goods are defined by an underlying value structure, and such structures tend to mirror the interests of the powerful groups in the community. The fundamental problem is that the equality of the rights and redistribution of the goods cannot remedy disaster injustices. Taking a case study from Nepal's earthquake 2015, this paper aims to link key works on disasters with justice theories - an attempt, which could help strengthen the conceptual foundations of policy responses to disaster recovery. We use the Nepal case of earthquake recovery to demonstrate the relevance of disaster justice lens which emphasizes the role of disaster justice champions, critical politics of knowledge, accountability, representation and disaster justice convictions. We demonstrate that the platform of critical knowledge politics is important where civic science and traditional science is deliberated, interrogated, negotiated and integrated. We argue that only when disaster justice champions with convictions of priority to the disadvantaged effectively utilizes the platform of critical knowledge politics, it is possible to influence political deliberations and decision making that can potentially enhance disaster justice in practice. Finally, and in a more theoretical sense, we argue that in order to enhance disaster justice, responses need to be informed by the understanding of ‘justice as redistribution’ as well as ‘justice as recognition’.",Article,8 , International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,Apr 12,0,"

The responses of the Australian state are developed as a case study of actions and policies directed at refugees and temporary migrant workers through the COVID-19 pandemic. The theoretical framing of the article draws on racial capitalism to argue that the developments manifest during the ‘crisis times’ of COVID-19 are in large part a continuity of the exclusionary politics of bordering practices at the heart of neoliberal capitalism. The article proposes that a rethinking of foundational theoretical and methodological approaches in the social sciences are needed to reflect contemporary changes in justice claims, claims that increasingly recognize the multi-species nature of existential threats to all life.",Article,,,Sep 23,0,"

Digital mapping as feminist method: critical reflections,['Bianca Fileborn'],"Digital maps have been taken up as a productive tool in both activism and academic research. However, there has been less consideration of their use as a research method in qualitative social sciences research. This paper aims to contribute towards scholarship on qualitative research by providing a critical reflection on the use of digital mapping as a research method in a feminist research project on street-based harassment in Australia. Drawing on practices of reflexivity, as well as comments made by participants across 46 qualitative interviews, I consider how digital mapping can be used to facilitate feminist research, arguing that it represents a generative instrument which lends itself to the development of in-depth insights from participants. Yet, mapping also delimits the epistemological possibilities of qualitative research, and I consider how this method simultaneously constrains what can be known about street harassment.",Article,1 , Qualitative Research,,0,"

The Qualitative Report Digital Storytelling in Research: A Systematic Review,"['Adele de Jager', 'Andrea S Fogarty', 'Anna Tewson[...]', 'Katherine Boydell']","Digital storytelling refers to a 2 to 5 minute audio-visual clip combining photographs, voice-over narration, and other audio (Lambert, 2009) originally applied for community development, artistic and therapeutic purposes, and more recently adapted as an arts-based research method. To date, no systematic review of the use of digital storytelling in a research capacity, to generate information about a phenomenon has been conducted. Accordingly, our aim was to provide a systematic review of digital storytelling in research. The review identified 25 articles representing 23 discrete studies that met inclusion criteria. A thematic analysis of results indicated that digital storytelling in research was especially appropriate for use with marginalised groups, and was most commonly used in this context. There was some variation in the extent to which digital storytelling in research adhered to the principles with which it was originally developed. Surprisingly, although digital storytelling provides a ready-made knowledge translation product, few research projects employed the digital stories generated to this end. Across research projects, participants reported several benefits of digital storytelling. While some disadvantages were noted, overall, these were outweighed by the benefits of using a respectful, participatory research practice. © 2017: Adële de Jager, Andrea Fogarty, Anna Tewson, Caroline Lenette, Katherine M.

Child sexual abuse material on the darknet: A script analysis of how offenders operate,"['Benoit Leclerc', 'Jacqueline Drew', 'Thomas J Holt[...]', 'Sara Singh']","The development of online technologies in recent decades has facilitated the distribution and consumption of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) over the internet, which also led to the emergence of CSAM on the darknet-the segment of the internet hidden from the general public. Using data obtained from interviews with online investigators, this study uses crime script analysis to reconstruct step-by-step how offenders operate on the darknet. The findings highlight the three phases of the script: (1) the crime setup phase, (2) the crime completion phase, and (3) the crime continuation phase. Scripting is a practical method of developing concrete ways to address this problem. The implications of using crime scripts to fight CSAM are discussed.",Article,1 , Trends and Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice,,0,"

"The Danish Cartoons, Charlie Hebdo and the culture wars: satiric limits in comparative national and transnational perspectives",['Mark Rolfe'],"A considerable body of academic literature has lauded political satirists as rebellious defenders of democracy and free speech against an establishment. Although satire is not always rebellious, this reputation of satirists and of satire may itself be the object of partisan capture. In this article, it is the object of capture by right-wing populists. In that respect, satire and the meta-discourse about satire can be used like any political rhetoric in gathering like-minded allies, claiming standards, and fighting opponents. With the Danish cartoons crisis of 2005-2006 and the Charlie Hebdo massacre of 2015, proponents of culture wars rhetoric added satire to their list of Western cultural legacies that needed defence against Islamic terrorism as well as left authoritarian elites who suppressed free speech through political correctness. They constructed simplistic global political dichotomies about satire, free speech, and civilisation and lifted events out of local contexts in a process of global framing. The culture war rhetoric was absolutist in support of free speech and satire on the international level. But the national level reveals the hortatory and partisan side to this rhetoric and the complexities that belie the absolutist stand. Nations are the arenas where struggles over free speech and political humour are played out.",Article,1 , European Journal of Humour Research,,0,"

Importance of sex education for a successful transition to life after school: Experiences of high school girls with intellectual disability,"['Iva Strnadová', 'Julie Loblinzk', 'Joanne Danker']","Accessible summary • Quality sex education is important for all students. It also helps with a successful transition to life after school. • We talked to 11 Australian high school girls with intellectual disability. We wanted to know what they think about their sex education at school. • The girls told us that they were often not included in Individual Learning Plan meetings. They were also not consulted about what they would like to learn in sex education. • Sex education classes were largely inaccessible for them. • Accessible sex education classes are important to prepare students for life after school. Abstract 1.1 Background Students with intellectual disability often do not receive holistic sex education, which is critical for their successful transition to post-school life, including having an ability to make healthy choices about their sexuality and relationships. The aim of this inclusive research study was to explore the perceptions and experiences of sex education with Australian high school girls with intellectual disability, as they prepare for a transition to post-school life. 1.2 Method There were 11 high school girls aged 13–20 years who participated in this study. Interviews were conducted and analysed using inductive content analysis. 1.3 Findings The findings indicate that critical topics such as gender and sexual identity, and masturbation are not sufficiently covered in sex education in New South Wales, Australia. The participating girls also highlighted ways in which teachers could make sex education lessons more accessible. Individual Learning Plan meetings, an important platform for transition planning, were attended by less than a third of the girls in this study. 1.4 Conclusions Comprehensive and accessible programmes on sex educati

"Impact of national guidelines on use of BRCA1/2 germline testing, risk management advice given to women with pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants and uptake of advice","['Bettina Meiser', 'R. Kaur', 'April Morrow[...]', 'Gillian Mitchell']","Background This nationwide study assessed the impact of nationally agreed cancer genetics guidelines on use of BRCA1/2 germline testing, risk management advice given by health professionals to women with pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants and uptake of such advice by patients. Methods Clinic files of 883 women who had initial proband screens for BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants at 12 familial cancer clinics between July 2008–July 2009 (i.e. before guideline release), July 2010–July 2011 and July 2012–July 2013 (both after guideline release) were audited to determine reason given for genetic testing. Separately, the clinic files of 599 female carriers without a personal history of breast/ovarian cancer who underwent BRCA1/2 predictive genetic testing and received their results pre- and post-guideline were audited to ascertain the risk management advice given by health professionals. Carriers included in this audit were invited to participate in a telephone interview to assess uptake of advice, and 329 agreed to participate. Results There were no significant changes in the percentages of tested patients meeting at least one published indication for genetic testing - 79, 77 and 78% of files met criteria before guideline, and two-, and four-years post-guideline, respectively (χ = 0.25, p = 0.88). Rates of documentation of post-test risk management advice as per guidelines increased significantly from pre- to post-guideline for 6/9 risk management strategies. The strategies with the highest compliance amongst carriers or awareness post-release of guidelines were annual magnetic resonance imaging plus mammography in women 30–50 years (97%) and annual mammography in women > 50 years (92%).

Perspectives of professionals on the safety and accessibility of aged care for Care Leavers and Forgotten Australians,"['Kathryn Browne-Yung', ""Diana O'Neil"", 'Ruth Walker[...]', 'Monica Cations']","Objectives: Little is known about how prepared the aged care system is to meet the specific needs of Care Leavers and Forgotten Australians. We explored service provider and advocate perspectives about the barriers and facilitators for appropriate and safe care for this group. Methods: Three focus groups with sixteen professional stakeholders examined the ways aged care support is accessible and inaccessible for Forgotten Australians. Results: Participants noted structural and organisational features that act as barriers to best practice aged care. It was perceived that funding models and processes provide insufficient opportunity to develop trust with professionals and access tailored care. Once engaged with aged care services, the sector lacks the psychological literacy required to tailor care to manage the complex needs and preferences of Forgotten Australians. Conclusion: Systemic and organisational change that promotes increased flexibility, trauma-informed care and non-residential housing options will improve the safety and accessibility of aged care for Forgotten Australians.",Article,1 , Australasian Journal on Ageing,,0,"

Benefit of China’s Social Health Insurance Schemes: Trend Analysis and Associated Factors Since Health Reform,"['Wanyue Dong', 'Anthony Zwi', 'Ruhai Bai[...]', 'Jianmin Gao']","With the deepening of health insurance reform in China, the integration of social health insurance schemes was put on the agenda. This paper aims to illustrate the achievements and the gaps in integration by demonstrating the trends in benefits available from the three social health insurance schemes, as well as the influencing factors. Data were drawn from the three waves of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (2009, 2011, 2015) undertaken since health reforms commenced. χ2, Kruskal–Wallis test, and the Two-Part model were employed in the analysis. The overall reimbursement rate of the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) is higher than that of Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) or the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) (p < 0.001), but the gap has narrowed since health reform began in 2009. Both the outpatient and inpatient reimbursement amounts have increased through the URBMI and NRCMS. Illness severity, higher institutional level, and inpatient service were associated with significant increases in the amount of reimbursement received across the three survey waves. The health reform improved benefits covered by the URBMI and NRCMS, but gaps with the UEBMI still exist. The government should consider more the release of health benefits and how to lead toward healthcare equity.",Article,1 , International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,1,"

Embracing the future: an evaluation of sexuality workshops for parents and carers of children and young people with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders,"['Erin Donnelly', 'Ee-Lin Chang', 'Yan Cheng', 'Jessica R Botfield']","Background: Evidence shows that parents and carers are often under resourced and lacking confidence and awareness in supporting their child or young person with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with puberty, sexuality and relationships. Method: In 2018, Family Planning NSW (funded by nib Foundation) delivered six workshops to parents and carers across NSW focussing on puberty, sexuality and relationships education for children and young people with ID and ASD. Pre and post workshop surveys were completed by participants (n = 116) with a three month follow-up via online survey or telephone interview to evaluate the effectiveness of the workshop. Quantitative data was analysed using STATA 14.0. Qualitative data was summarised by theme or analysed in Nvivo using thematic analyses. Results: A significant improvement in participants’ knowledge and confidence level in providing sexuality support to their child/young person between the pre- and post-workshop survey was found across survey respondents, with those gains retained at the three month follow up. Respondents also identified barriers in supporting their child or young person, including lack of understanding about how to adapt information effectively to their child’s needs, lack of time, and a scarcity of workshops and resources in regional areas. Implications: The provision of sexuality workshops to build the knowledge and confidence of parents and carers is highly valuable. However, improving the sexuality support provided to children and young people should also focus on identifying and minimising barriers to providing that support.",Conference Paper,,,,0,"

A Comparative Content Analysis of Pre-Internet and Contemporary Child Sexual Abuse Material,"['Michael Salter', 'Tyson Whitten']","Child sexual abuse material is now recognised as a major social problem however, prior to the internet, disclosures of victimisation in abuse material were the subject of sceptical scholarly commentary. The veracity of the sceptical position has been subject to limited empirical scrutiny. The aim of this study is to analyse the content of a sample of 1004 images of pre-internet abuse material. The pre-internet sample was analysed according to the characteristics of victim/s, perpetrator/s and severity and setting of abuse, which were then compared to a pre-existing dataset of 34,561 contemporary abuse images. The findings of the study underscore the severity of pre-internet abuse material. The comparison between the pre-internet and contemporary sample found that the average age of girls abused in abuse material has decreased, and the severity of the material has increased. The study highlights the significant abuse experienced by abuse material victims prior to the internet, and suggests the popularisation of the internet is linked to a trend towards more serious offending against children in abuse material. The consistent role of the home as the major site of abuse material production poses significant challenges to prevention, early intervention and prosecution.",Article,1 , Deviant Behavior,,1,"

Land rights in peacebuilding discourse: domination and resistance in Timor-Leste’s Ita Nia Rai program,"['Maxim Mancino', 'Srinjoy Bose']","The development of land rights programs is deeply rooted in power relations. Using discourse analysis, this paper unpacks how Western logics (assumptions and conventions) regarding ‘best practices’ for property rights institutions and tenure security impact the design of peacebuilding programs. In 2017, the Government of Timor-Leste passed a controversial Land Law Package. These laws were initially developed for a USAID land reform program. But local dynamics, actions, and interests were ignored. Examining civil society exclusion from decision-making infers a reluctance to acknowledge local voices and practices that threaten liberal peacebuilding interests. This paper is organised into two parts. In the first, we argue that peacebuilding ‘best practices’ reflect how dominant Western discourses create conceptual boundaries (‘violent hierarchies’) to restrict the recognition of indigenous ideas as legitimate. In the second, we examine Timorese civil society efforts to improve the land reform program through acts of resistance to bodies of authority. Overall, we illuminate how in Timor-Leste Western assumptions and conventions contributed to boundaries to local participation, which contradicts liberal narratives of empowerment and capacity-building.",Article,1 , Australian Journal Of International Affairs,Apr 5,1,"

Social and emotional wellbeing of indigenous gender and sexuality diverse youth: mapping the evidence,"['Karen Soldatic', 'Linda Briskman', 'William Trewlynn[...]', 'Kim Spurway']","There has been little exploration of the social and emotional wellbeing of young Indigenous populations who identify as gender and sexuality diverse. Given the vulnerability of this cohort in settler colonial societies such as Australia, Canada and the USA, wider investigation is called for in order to respond to their needs and aspirations. Using a scoping review, this paper maps existing research on the intersections of youth, gender and sexuality diversity, Indigeneity and wellbeing. The evidence points to the importance of historical and contemporary experiences tied to colonisation and intergenerational trauma. For young Indigenous gender and sexuality diverse peoples, heteronormative colonial value systems converge to produce environments characterised by racism, phobia and marginalisation. The evidence base includes deficit models based on trauma and negative outcomes.

Elder Mediation Services Among Diverse Older Adult Communities in Australia: Practitioner Perspectives on Accessibility,"['Annie Herro', 'Ka Yee Lee', 'Adrienne Withall[...]', 'Craig Sinclair']","Background and objectives: Elder abuse is a complex problem, and barriers to reporting and help-seeking include shame and fear of loss of relationships with key family members. Elder-mediation has been identified as one promising method of alternative dispute resolution. This study aimed to investigate the accessibility of elder-mediation services among diverse groups of older adults, from the perspective of practitioners in a large Australian jurisdiction. Research design and methods: The study employed a sequential mixed-methods approach, comprising a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews (N=17) and an online survey of practitioners (N=49) involved in referral to, or provision of, elder-mediation services. Accessibility was conceptualized using existing theoretical frameworks, spanning practical (logistics-related) and normative (justice and culture-related) dimensions. Results: Factors limiting accessibility of elder-mediation services included lack of community and practitioner awareness of elder abuse and elder-mediation, discomfort with the mediation process, financial costs, lack of services in regional and remote areas and complex service systems for older people. Within the mediation process, difficulties in assessing and accommodating cognitive and other impairments, managing power imbalances and determining the appropriateness of the dispute for mediation were influential. Discussion and implications: This study showed that mediation can be a promising and effective approach to resolving disputes involving older people. The emergent perceptive dimension (community and practitioner awareness) emphasizes the importance of awareness raising efforts surrounding both elder abus

Outcomes of routine screening for reproductive coercion in a family planning service,"['Yan Cheng', 'Eleanor Wilson', 'Jessica R Botfield[...]', 'Kevin McGeechan']","Background: Reproductive coercion (RC) occurs when a person's autonomous decision-making regarding reproductive health is compromised by another. RC screening, that is, the use of routine, non-invasive screening questions asked of service users/clients, is one strategy that can be used to assess for RC. Routine screening for RC was implemented within Family Planning NSW clinical consultations in December 2018. A cross-sectional study was undertaken to review the outcomes of screening to better understand the situation of RC among women accessing family planning services. Methods: A retrospective review of clinical consultation data of eligible women attending Family Planning NSW clinics in 2019 was undertaken. Descriptive analysis was conducted and modified Poisson regression was used to estimate prevalence ratios and assess associations between binary outcomes and client characteristics. Results: Of 7943 women eligible for RC screening, 5497 were screened (69%) and 127 women (2.3%) disclosed RC. RC was more likely to be disclosed among clients who were unemployed, had a disability or had more than one visit within 1 year. Conclusions: Sexual and reproductive health clinicians, in particular, are well placed to conduct RC screening. However, they must have adequate training and access to resources to implement screening and respond to women who disclose RC.",Article,1 , Sexual Health,,0,"

Characteristics and Impacts of Sexual Violence Against Men and Boys in Conflict and Displacement: A Multicountry Exploratory Study,"['Sarah Chynoweth', 'Dale Buscher', 'Sarah Martin', 'Anthony Zwi']","Evidence of sexual violence against men and boys in many conflict-affected settings is increasingly recognized. Yet relatively little is currently known about the varied forms, sites, and impacts of this violence. Further, scant research on sexual violence against men and boys in displacement contexts has been undertaken to date. To begin to address these knowledge gaps, we undertook a multicountry, qualitative, exploratory study to gain insights into these issues. Study settings and populations were Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh; refugees and migrants who had traveled through Libya residing in Italy; and refugees from eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Somalia, and South Sudan residing in Nairobi and Mombasa, Kenya. Methods included 55 semi-structured focus group discussions with 310 refugees and semi-structured key informant interviews with 148 aid workers 1 Women's Refugee Commission, 2 Journal of Interpersonal Violence and human rights experts. Data were thematically analyzed using NVivo 12. Findings suggest that sexual violence against men and boys may not be rare in Myanmar (northern Rakhine state), Libya, eastern DRC, and South Sudan. Frequently reported forms of violence in these settings were genital violence, forced witnessing of sexual violence, and rape. Sites where violence was often reported included border crossings, along the roadside, and during imprisonment. In host countries, forms of sexual violence included sexual abuse of boys, sexual exploitation particularly of adolescents and persons with diverse sexual orientation and gender identity, and rape. Impacts on survivors involved short-and long-term physical, mental, economic, and familial dimensions. These findings aim

Mothers & Daughters : Redefining Cultural Continuity Through South Sudanese Women’s Artistic Practices,"['Caroline Lenette', 'Apuk Maror', 'Serena Manwaring']","A group of South Sudanese women came together in 2018 to share artistic and cultural practices with one another during a series of creative workshops at a community art gallery in Sydney, Australia. We collaborated with the women to organise workshop activities and a community event to showcase their cultural artefacts and items created during the workshops. Through a research-arts partnership, we documented women’s conversations about their artistic and cultural traditions and practices during weekly gatherings and pre and post-workshop discussions. This paper suggests that the women involved in these participant-designed and driven workshops were redefining their culture and cultural practices in a different place, and shaped new notions of cultural continuity, defined as the process of maintaining and passing on traditional knowledge. They conceptualised cultural traditions as everyday practices in their lived realities, and as points of connections with the past. The creation of a women-only space for artistic practices in a resettlement context provided regular opportunities for women of different ages to discuss culturally-prescribed gender norms and traditions candidly. Participant-led research-arts collaborations represent a flexible approach to exploring women’s notions of art and culture and gender-based experiences to understand how they navigate everyday social realities.",Article,9 , Journal of Intercultural Studies,,0,"

Adapting Service Delivery during COVID-19: Experiences of Domestic Violence Practitioners,"['Natasha Cortis', 'Ciara Smyth', 'Kylie valentine[...]', 'Patricia Cullen']","COVID-19 rapidly altered patterns of domestic and family violence, increasing the complexity of women’s needs, and presenting new barriers to service use. This article examines service responses in Australia, exploring practitioners' accounts of adapting service delivery models in the early months of the pandemic. Data from a qualitatively enriched online survey of practitioners (n = 100) show the ways services rapidly shifted to engage with clients via remote, technology-mediated modes, as physical distancing requirements triggered rapid expansion in the use of phone, email, video calls and messaging, and many face-to-face interventions temporarily ceased. Many practitioners and service managers found that remote service delivery improved accessibility and efficiency. Others expressed concerns about their capacity to assess risk without face-to-face contact, and were unsure whether new service modalities would meet the needs of all client groups and reflect best practice. Findings attest to practitioners' mixed experiences during this period of rapid service innovation and change, and underline the importance of monitoring emerging approaches to establish which service adaptations are effective for different groups of people, and to determine good practice for combining remote and face-to-face service options in the longer term.",Article,1 , British Journal of Social Work,Jul 31,0,"

The interviews demonstrate the different ways in which social inclusion/exclusion practices, patterns and process within First Nations communities and non-Indigenous LGBTIQ+ communities impact on the SCEWB of these young people. The research demonstrates the importance of acceptance and support from families in particular the centrality of mothers to young people feeling accepted, safe and able to successfully overcome challenges to SCEWB. Non-Indigenous urban LGBTIQ+ communities are at times seen as a “second family” for young people, however, structural racism within these communities is also seen as a problem for young people’s inclusion.

Young Carers in Australia: Understanding Experiences of Caring and Support-Seeking Behaviour,"['Isaac Yeboah Addo', 'Sienna Aguilar', 'Sarah Judd-Lam[...]', 'Abner Weng Cheong Poon']","Although young carers experience several challenges associated with their roles, little is known about the current effects of those challenges on their education, work, and social life. Their support-seeking behaviour is also under-researched. Based on findings from 25 interviews and a focus group discussion, this qualitative study presents insights into the effects of providing informal care on the lives of young carers and their support-seeking behaviour. Participants reported several physical, mental, and social effects of caring that have either positive or negative implications for their lives. Whereas providing care influenced early maturity, self-efficacy, and formation of stronger bonds with care recipients, it also limited participants’ ability to find work, focus on their education, and socialise with peers. Utilisation of formal community-based and professional support services was low among the participants. Stigma associated with the label “carer”; lack of youth-friendly service settings; lack of self-identification of carer status; and a lack of cultural, age, and specific support services for different stages of caring constrained the use of support services among participants. In contrast, positive attitudes of service providers encouraged the use of support services. These findings highlight an urgent need for more professional support for young carers. • IMPLICATIONS • Failure to provide sufficient professional support to young carers can aggravate the negative consequences associated with their caring roles. • Social workers and other professionals can strengthen their collaboration with educators, work supervisors, and other support agencies to address the challenges of providing care at a young age. • Given that caring roles

Sintering expansion behavior and expansion mechanism of Cu-Ni-Al powder alloy,"['Y. Feng', 'Y.-M. Li', 'Haobin He', 'Z.-Y. Zeng']","Cu-10Ni-1.25Al alloy was prepared by compression molding with Cu, Ni and Al powder. The sintering behavior and expansion mechanism of Cu-Ni-Al system powder alloy were investigated. The results show that considerable expansion occurs after being sintered at 600-800°C, accompanied by the decrease of density and increase of porosity. The measurements including differential thermal analysis, EDAX analysis and metallographic observation were conducted, and it is proved that the compacts perform the larger and faster expansion after the appearance of Al-rich melt which forms by the reaction of Al with Cu and Ni at 600°C. Al-rich melt penetrates into the grain boundaries of Cu particles and leaves pores at the prior Al particle sites. Because of a large solubility of Al in the Cu and Ni, Al-rich melt is finally absorbed into the solid as a result of unbalanced diffusion between components, leading to the net mass flow between the solid/liquid interfaces, which brings about the solid particle grain growth and the increase in the volume of the specimen as a whole.",Article,0 , Zhongnan Daxue Xuebao (Ziran Kexue Ban)/Journal of Central South University (Science and Technology),Apr 19,0,"

When Following the Rules Is Bad for Wellbeing: The Effects of Gendered Rules in the Australian Construction Industry,"['Natalie Galea', 'Abigail Powell', 'Fanny Salignac[...]', 'Martin Loosemore']","The construction industry is known to be highly masculinised and to have work practices detrimental to employees’ wellbeing. Drawing on feminist institutional theory and a rapid ethnographic approach in two construction multinationals in Australia, we examine the relationship between the gendered nature of construction and workplace wellbeing for professional women and men employed in the industry. The findings reveal that adhering to the gendered ‘rules in use’ in the construction industry is negatively associated with wellbeing and is usually endured in silence. We also identify the ways in which the gendered rules have different effects on the wellbeing of men and women. We conclude that the construction industry is characterised by a set of ‘greedy’ gendered institutions that are inextricably linked to workplace wellbeing for both men and women and that these rules must be broken to improve worker wellbeing.",Article,1 , Work Employment and Society,,0,"

"Greening Sydney: attitudes, barriers and opportunities for tree planting","['Natalia Saldarriaga', 'Krishna K. Shrestha', 'Phil McManus', 'Ayusha Bajracharya']","Understanding people’s attitudes towards the urban forest is crucial to advance sustainability goals and for proposing policy changes in local governments. With global cities such as Sydney becoming highly multi-cultural, it is vital for local governments in cities to be responsive to the diverse voices and interests of their residents. This paper investigates attitudes of people from different socio-economic backgrounds and thereby identifies barriers and opportunities for tree planting. Analysing two socio-economically diverse local government areas (LGAs) in Sydney, viz. Parramatta and North Sydney, this paper demonstrates that residents’ attitudes towards trees depends largely on tree location. Trees located on private land, are preferred for aesthetics and functionality (e.g. beauty and privacy), and trees are removed if they represent a threat to residents’ health or infrastructure. Trees located on public land are appreciated because people prefer to live along a tree-lined street where aesthetic and environmental values of trees are paramount. The above attitudes vary with income, education and dwelling type. Findings from this study suggest that local governments must engage effectively with socio-economically diverse populations and recognise different attitudes of communities in policies and practices for managing urban greenery.",Article,0 , Australian Geographer,,0,"

"Impact and Return on Investment of the Take Kare Safe Space Program—A Harm Reduction Strategy Implemented in Sydney, Australia","['Christopher M. Doran', 'Phillip Wadds', 'Anthony Shakeshaft', 'Dam Anh Tran']","Safe spaces are increasingly utilized to reduce alcohol-related harm, violence, crime and improve public safety in nightlife settings. This study aimed to determine the impact and return on investment of the Take Kare Safe Space (TKSS) program—a harm reduction program implemented to address alcohol-related violence and disorder in three locations in Sydney’s night-time economy between 2014 and 2019. TKSS ambassadors provided support at static safe spaces and patrolled designated nightlife precincts to provide practical assistance to vulnerable and intoxicated people. Ambassadors recorded information relating to these interactions including ‘client’ age, gender, perceived level of intoxication, time and length of engagement with the program. Costs of program implementation and benefits of major incidents averted were obtained to allow calculation of return on investment. From December 2014 to April 2019, 66,455 people were supported by TKSS ambassadors. Most users were male (62%) and aged 18–25 years (66%). Of 3633 interventions by ambassadors, serious risk of harm was averted in 735 cases (20%). The program’s return on investment is estimated at 2.67, suggesting that a $1 investment results in $2.67 in benefits. Safe Spaces are extensively utilized, particularly by young males with high levels of intoxication, and represent a positive return on investment. Despite the growth of such services, there remains a notable absence of rigorous, independent evaluation regarding the outcomes and/or social benefit of safe space programs. From a policy perspective, there is a need for more high-quality economic evaluations to better inform decisions about competing uses of limited resources.",Article,1 , International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,0,"

SELF-REPRESENTATION IN PARTICIPATORY VIDEO RESEARCH: ETHICS AND LESSONS LEARNT,"['Caroline Lenette', 'Isobel Blomfield', 'Arash Bordbar[...]', 'Anyier Yuol']","Participatory video involves co-researchers using digital or video cameras to create their own videos and present issues according to their sense of what is important. In 2018, the authors—including three co-researchers from refugee backgrounds—collaborated through participatory video research to document views on better access and participation in higher education. Here, we reflect on key ethical issues encountered and share lessons learnt from our project. Our aim is not to discredit this methodology but to contribute new discussions on how participatory video can be used effectively as a form of self-representation to target wide audiences and effect social and policy change. This way, debates on the social and political potentialities of arts-based methods such as participatory video can be expanded. Since deploying participatory video in forced migration research is a relatively novel approach, there is much scope to expand the contours of knowledge on its potential to reach diverse audiences and open up new opportunities for social and political impact.",Article,0 , Art/Research International A Transdisciplinary Journal,,0,"

Women and new labour: Engendering politics and policy?,"['Claire Annesley', 'F. Gains', 'Kirstein Rummery']","Although there is a growing body of international literature on the feminisation of politics and the policy process and, as New Labour’s term of office progresses, a rapidly growing series of texts around New Labour’s politics and policies, until now no one text has conducted an analysis of New Labour’s politics and policies from a gendered perspective, despite the fact that New Labour have set themselves up to specifically address women’s issues and attract women voters. This book fills that gap in an interesting and timely way. Women and New Labour will be a valuable addition to both feminist and mainstream scholarship in the social sciences, particularly in political science, social policy and economics. Instead of focusing on traditionally feminist areas of politics and policy (such as violent crime against women) the authors opt to focus on three case study areas of mainstream policy (economic policy, foreign policy and welfare policy) from a gendered perspective. The analytical framework provided by the editors yields generalisable insights that will outlast New Labour’s third term.",Book,,,,0,"

Importance of sex education for a successful post-school transition: Experiences of high school girls with intellectual disability,"['Iva Strnadová', 'Julie Loblinzk', 'Joanne Danker']","Background. Students with intellectual disability often do not receive holistic sex education, which is critical for their successful transition to post-school life, including having an ability to make healthy choices about their sexuality and relationships. The aim of this inclusive research study was to explore the perceptions and experiences of sex education with Australian high school girls with intellectual disability, as they prepare for a transition to post-school life. Method. There were 11 high school girls aged 13 – 20 years who participated in this study. The interviews were analysed using inductive content analysis. Findings. The findings indicate that critical topics such as gender and sexual identity, and masturbation are not sufficiently covered in sex education in New South Wales, Australia. The participating girls also highlighted ways in which teachers could make sex education lessons more accessible. Individual Learning Plan meetings, an important platform for transition planning, were attended by less than a third of the girls in this study. Conclusions. Comprehensive and accessible programs on sex education for high school girls with intellectual disability are needed to promote successful transition to an autonomous life for these students.",Article,1 , British Journal of Learning Disabilities,,0,"

Scoping Review of Family Interventions That Support the Physical Health of Caregivers,"['Abner Weng Cheong Poon', 'Julia Lappin', 'Alyssa Cassidy', 'Jan Breckenridge']","Purpose Family interventions have been developed to support carers of people with mental illness, but not much is known about how such interventions can improve carers’ physical health. This review aimed to identify and analyze existing family interventions that addressed the physical health of carers. Methods A scoping review was conducted to identify peer-reviewed journal articles on family interventions with physical health components. A total of six articles were found and analyzed thematically to identify the family interventions, physical health components of the interventions, and associated physical health outcomes. Results Synthesis of the findings from relevant articles showed that the development of physical health components in family interventions is emerging and at an early stage. However, most studies had physical health as a minor area focusing mainly on stress and sleep. Conclusions Family interventions would be more holistic if consideration of physical health issues was addressed as a core module.",Article,0 , Research on Social Work Practice,Nov 4,0,"

‘Better than a pill’: digital storytelling as a narrative process for refugee women,"['Caroline Lenette', 'Mark Brough', 'Robert Schweitzer[...]', 'Lyn Vromans']","Digital storytelling is a valuable and ethical research tool to engage in collaborative research with refugee women. This paper recounts how digital storytelling was used in a mixed-methods study on settlement, to document the journeys of women who entered Australia through the Woman at Risk program in 2014–2015. Instead of merely asking a series of questions, the digital storytelling process extended our qualitative inquiry as an approach that valued the women’s own memories, interests, and hopes. The methodology represents a meaningful way of engaging in collaborative research, where participating women were not just storytellers but valued as active co-constructors of new knowledge. We outline each of three digital narratives as a ‘whole’ to consider what we can learn from a storytelling process where women with complex circumstances are privileged as protagonists-and-producers of their own stories. We argue that it is worth critically reflecting on the concepts the women propose for themselves as meaningful ways to articulate their lives, when we relinquish the researcher role as question asker to enter a space alongside participants and listen intently. Our paper highlights the broader potential of digital storytelling particularly in mental health research in collaboration with refugee participants.",Article,8 , Media Practice and Education,,1,"

Artistic Representations of Refugees: What Is the Role of the Artist?,"['Isobel Blomfield', 'Caroline Lenette']","The literature on ethical considerations for artists involved in collaborative projects with refugees and asylum seekers is sparse, indicating a lack of robust discussions on the ethical pitfalls artists may encounter in such endeavours. Based on the first author’s reflections on her subjective experiences as an artist representing the story of a young Somali asylum seeker woman through collaborative filmmaking, this paper aims to open up broader discussions about artists’ responsibilities to produce counter-narratives that value refugees’ perspectives and voices. By doing so, artists can avoid perpetuating existing tropes that can at times be detrimental to refugees and asylum seekers, and ensure that artists’ own agendas are secondary to what ‘protagonists’ wish to convey. We suggest five simple ways of realising this goal: genuine collaboration; informed consent; anonymity; focusing on the mundane; and (in the case of filmmaking specifically) an awareness of the editing process as a political act.",Article,8 , Journal of Intercultural Studies,Jun 25,1,"

Gendered Responses to Gendered Harms: Sexual Violence and Bystander Intervention at Australian Music Festivals,"['Greta Baillie', 'Bianca Fileborn', 'Phillip Wadds']","Bystander intervention has shown promise in preventing sexual violence in certain social contexts. Despite emerging evidence of pervasive sexual violence at music festivals, no research has considered bystander intervention in this setting. Drawing on an online survey conducted with 371 Australian festival attendees, we explore the role of gender on bystander intervention at music festivals. Findings point to significant gender differences, with women more willing and likely to intervene in a broader range of scenarios. We argue that responses to sexual violence are a collective responsibility shared by both women and men, as well as festival organizers and industry bodies.",Article,1 , Violence Against Women,,0,"

An emerging concern: Does social media addiction strengthen social bonds or isolating from society?,['Md Badiuzzaman'],"It has commonly believed that scrolling and surfing through social media strengthen social bonding. As a consequence, during the last decade, social media has increased in popularity. Currently, 3.96 billion people use different social networking platforms, which became double in 2021, which was 2.07 billion in 2015 [1]. Therefore, the ease of using these virtual media for social communication provisionally appeared extremely useful. However, sociologists believe that virtual social interaction has ushered in a dark era or that one is on the horizon[2]. Evidently, it has become a rising concern that social media addiction is isolating users from real society.",Article,,,,0,"

Rates of homicide and homicide associated with severe mental illness in NSW between 1993 and 2016,"['Olav Nielssen', 'Georgia Lyons', 'Katya Oldfield[...]', 'Matthew Large']","Objective To describe the characteristics of offenders found not guilty on the grounds of mental illness (NGMI) in New South Wales and rates of NGMI and other homicide verdicts. Method Demographic, legal and clinical data after referral to the NSW Mental Health Review Tribunal following an NGMI verdict for homicide matched with results from the National Homicide Monitoring Program. Results Between 1993 and 2016, a total of 2159 homicide offenders were dealt with by the NSW courts, including 169 (7.8%) who were found NGMI. Over this period, the rate of non-NGMI homicide convictions fell from 1.83 per 100,000 per annum to 0.65 per 100,000 per annum (Kendall’s tau = −0.79, p ⩽ 0.001) while the rate of NGMI homicide fluctuated, with an average annual rate of about 0.1 per 100,000 per annum (Kendall’s tau = 0.17, p = 0.23). There was no association between the annual rates of NGMI and non-NGMI homicides (Pearson r = −0.3, p = 0.16) but falling rate of non-NGMI homicide meant that the proportion of NGMI offences doubled from 5.5% in the first 12 years to 11% in the second 12 years. Nearly all (88.7%) of those found NGMI had a schizophrenia-related psychosis. However, there were high rates of psychiatric comorbidity including substance use disorder (60.7%) and a history of a prior head injury (41.1%). Most (83.4%) of the NGMI offenders had previous contact with mental health services, but only half of these had received treatment with antipsychotic medication. Conclusion The fall in conviction for homicide offences in the last 24 years has not been matched by a reduction in NGMI homicide verdicts.

Regulation of nursing professionals in Cambodia: strategies to overcome underpinning challenges,"['Sadatoshi Matsuoka', 'Noriko Fujita', 'Kyoko Koto-Shimada', 'Anthony Zwi']","Aims To elucidate (i) the challenges and constraints in the development and implementation of the regulatory framework for nursing professionals in Cambodia and (ii) the specific strategies adopted to address the challenges experienced in Cambodia. Introduction The health workforce will be critical to achieving the health‐related and wider Sustainable Development Goals in the years up to 2030. Background In 2006, the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations signed a Mutual Recognition Arrangement in relation to nursing services in the region with the main aim of facilitating the mobility of nursing professionals between countries. To ensure the competency of the health workforce and the quality and safety of health services, member states are required to establish an appropriate regulatory framework. Methods This is a qualitative descriptive study. Eighteen key informant interviews were conducted in Cambodia in 2018. Walt and Gilson’s policy analysis model was applied to organize and synthesize the data. Findings Major challenges were identified such as conceptual and cultural issues, limited capacity of Cambodian stakeholders and an unstandardized system with limited coordination. Discussion In Cambodia, the nursing regulatory environment has expanded greatly over the last decade. Strategies adopted were ‘political leadership’, optimal utilization of ‘outsider’s capacity’, strengthening ‘insider’s capacity’, and ‘dedicated consultation and collaboration and consensus building’ involving all players. Implications for nursing and health policies Policymakers in similar resource‐limited countries could apply and adapt similar strategic efforts when formulating and implementing health policies, legislation and regul

Shrinking room for hedging: system-unit dynamics and behavior of smaller powers,['Alexander Korolev'],"This article advances the understanding of ‘hedging’ in international politics by highlighting and examining the limits to smaller powers’ hedging behavior. Building on the line of reasoning that hedging is an outcome of regional or state-level, rather than system-level, variables, the article suggests that the room for hedging available to smaller states shrinks as great powers become more competitive and attempt to balance against one another. With an empirical focus on the post-Cold War South China Sea region, particularly the evolving behavior of the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia, the article demonstrates how, under the conditions of growing China–US competition, these regional states start moving from hedging to more pronounced bandwagoning vis-à-vis great powers regardless their domestic-level sociopolitical dispositions. Therefore, hedging has limits and can be envisaged as a ‘luxury’ that is inversely related to the intensity of great power balancing.",Article,9 , International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,,0,"

"The need for a community-led, holistic service response to Aboriginal young people with cognitive disability in remote areas: a case study","['Ruth McCausland', 'Leanne Dowse']","There are multiple structural and practical barriers to Aboriginal young people with cognitive disability in remote areas receiving the support and services they need. Multidisciplinary mixed-methods research over the past decade has provided evidence of the ways that many such young people end up with complex support needs and being ‘managed’ by police and justice agencies in the absence of appropriate early intervention, transition support and community-based options. This article presents and synthesises knowledge generated by this body of work and contextualises it within the experiences and trajectory of a young Aboriginal woman with cognitive disability and complex support needs from a remote town. This case study is drawn from a New South Wales linked administrative dataset containing data from health, housing, disability, human services, police, legal, court and justice agencies on a cohort of people who have been incarcerated.

The female condom: What do Australian women say?,"['Jessica R Botfield', 'Sarah Cucuzza', 'Prudence Kidman[...]', 'Deborah Bateson']","Background The female condom is a barrier method for prevention of sexually transmissible infections and unintended pregnancy. Uptake of this method remains low in Australia, although little research has been undertaken to explore this. Methods An interventional cross‐sectional study was undertaken in 2019 to explore the views and experiences of women in New South Wales. After trying the female condom, they were invited to complete an online survey and/or structured interview. Training in use of the female condom was not provided. This paper reports on qualitative findings from open‐ended survey responses and interviews. Results In total 284 participants completed the survey, and 20 participated in an interview. Most were aware of the female condom prior to participating in the study, but few had used it previously. Four broad themes were identified from the data: i) accessibility of the female condom, including cost and availability, ii) supporting choice in different circumstances, iii) aspects of empowerment and control, and iv) use of gendered language. Conclusions The female condom may be an acceptable option for many women in Australia. To support choice of method and promote uptake, it will be important to increase accessibility of the female condom by raising awareness and addressing issues of cost and availability. Further exploration of issues regarding inclusive language and messaging in health promotion campaigns and marketing is warranted to ensure this product is accessible for all people who may wish to use it, regardless of gender or sexuality. Similar research could be undertaken with men/partners and members of the LGBTQ+ community to explore their perspectives of the female condom.

Fe-50%Ni soft magnetic alloy prepared by metal injection molding,"['Z.-Y. Zeng', 'Y.-M. Li', 'Haobin He', 'L.

The effects of sintering atmosphere, sintering temperature and time, as well as heat treatment conditions on the magnetic properties of MIM Fe-50%Ni alloy were systematically investigated. Impurity content, density, microstructure and magnetic properties of specimens prepared by different techniques were determined, finding that the maximum magnetic permeability and coercive force of MIM Fe-50%Ni alloy are considerably influenced by the content of interstitial atom such as C, O, etc. and the cooling mode of heat treatment, while the relative density is a predominant effect factor for the saturation induction and initial permeability of MIM Fe-50%Ni alloy. The specimens prepared by a series process including sintering at 1380°C in hydrogen atmosphere for 3 h, holding at 650°C for 1 h and then oil quenching has the optimum magnetic properties as follows: saturation induction strength (Bs), coercive force (Hc), maximum permeability (μm) and initial permeability (μi) are 1.495 T, 4.8 A/m, 75.2 mH/m, 9.18 mH/m, respectively.",Article,1 , Fenmo Yejin Cailiao Kexue yu Gongcheng/Materials Science and Engineering of Powder Metallurgy,,0,"

Driverless Autonomous Taxi Service: A futuristic open-source conceptual back-end architecture and technical operation strategies,['Md Badiuzzaman'],"Driverless taxi service is no longer a novel idea as few ventures have been testing the human-less/driverless taxi service—Google's parent company Alphabet testing autonomous taxi service in Phoenix, Arizona. A government and industry supported autonomous car service ""DRIVEN"" has been initiated in London since 2019. Another e-commerce giant, ""Alibaba"" formed a new firm, ""AutoX,"" and tested autonomous taxi services in some Shanghai city parts in China. Not only tech giants but even prominent universities are also taking part in the exciting race of human-less taxi service. An MIT based engineer brought a driverless taxi service to Singapore. Therefore, many tech giant companies and lead research universities are accelerating their pace to win the driverless taxi business's race at the background level. However, it seems the existing market dominators are ahead in the race, and as usual, they are going to grab the future driverless taxi service business. The article aims to propose a conceptual back-end operational architecture to construct a driverless taxi service. The development of driverless cars seems satisfactory, and already almost-driverless cars are available in the market (2020 Tesla Model S, 2020 Cadillac CT6, 2020 Nissan Rogue, 2020 BMW X7, 2020 Infiniti QX50, 2020 Volvo XC60, 2020 Mercedes-Benz S-Class). Therefore, an individual entrepreneur will organize his own driverless car taxi service using an operational strategy in the near future. This article will provide a conceptual framework that will be open-source and usable by other enthusiastic people to improve and put on the rail for further development. The framework will explain the technical, operational strategies, including the system diagram, flowcharts visually. It asserts h

Mapping Activist Responses and Policy Advocacy for Street Harassment: Current Practice and Future Directions,['Bianca Fileborn'],"This article presents findings from a comprehensive mapping exercise of activist responses to, and policy advocacy for, street harassment across the US, UK and Australia. Analysis of activist groups found that the bulk of responses constituted forms of “awareness raising” and documenting the experiences of victims, suggesting that current advocacy is largely situated within the “problem identification” phase of policy development. The extent and focus of activism and advocacy efforts varied across the three locations, with the responses advocated for shaped by local concerns and politics. In particular, activist groups diverged in their support for criminal justice responses to street harassment. Where policy and other initiatives have been developed, these have rarely been evaluated, and there is a clear need to establish an evidence base to better support future policy and practice developments.",Article,,,Mar 1,0,"

Planning for Health Sector Reform in Post-Conflict Situations: Kosovo 1999-2000,"['Dean A Shuey', 'Fatime Arenliu Qosaj', 'Erik Schouten', 'Anthony Zwi']","The restoration and development of health care systems in post-conflict situations and complex emergencies are attracting attention. Kosovo is unique in being a post-conflict situation, in a former socialist country, with an unclear political future, under temporary UN administration. The World Health Organization (WHO) led a process of developing a health policy framework for the emergency period that included elements of health sector reform, a somewhat controversial initiative. Reform elements of the policy were consistent with normative health policies in much of eastern and central Europe. There was tension between the need to have a policy in place rapidly and the desire to be participatory. Policy to deal with emergency situations that is not available at the time required is of limited value. Although there was some tension between relief and development agendas, the policy process did direct significant resources and effort in directions that contributed to longer-term reform and development. A policy framework does not ensure compliance with policy unless issues of authority, mandate, and leadership are clear. A rapidly developed health policy framework at the onset of an emergency is desirable. Policy developers should be experienced, seen as being neutral and be relatively independent of any specific donor or interest group. WHO is well situated to play this role if it meets certain conditions.",Article,3 , Health Policy,,0,"
