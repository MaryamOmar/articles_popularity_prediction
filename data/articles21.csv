Enhancing family nursing practice in schools: School nurses’ perspectives on illness beliefs and family nursing practice skills when caring for children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder or asthma – A cross-sectional study,"['Erla Kolbrun Svavarsdottir', 'Gudny Tryggvadottir', 'Margret Gisladottir', 'Ragnheidur Osk Erlendsdottir']","An increasing number of children attend schools with chronic illnesses/disorders that require managing and comprehensive healthcare from school nurses during the day. Collaboration between school nurses, the school-aged child with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or asthma, and their families is needed when coordinating/managing chronic health problems in the school setting. However, involving families in the assessment and care planning processes can be challenging. The aim of this study was to survey the illness beliefs of school nurses and their perceptions of their family nursing practice skills when offering healthcare services to children with ADHD or asthma in schools. A cross-sectional study was used for a sample of 82 school nurses. The manuscript was prepared following STROBE guidelines. Results indicated that the school nurses perceived themselves to be more confident and to have better knowledge and skill in family nursing practice when offering healthcare services to families of children with ADHD in comparison to asthma.",Article,,,,0,"

"Public or private school? Determinants for enrolment of adolescents in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau","['Geir Gunnlaugsson', 'Fatou N’dure Baboudóttir', 'Aladje Baldé[...]', 'Jónína Einarsdóttir']","Inequality in access to quality education is wide-ranging across and within countries. This study examines determinants for adolescents’ school enrolment in private and public schools in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau, including 2,039 randomly selected school-attending adolescents. The survey methodology was built on the Planet Youth collaboration and is the first of its kind in the setting. The critical determinant for attending a private school rather than a public one reflects parental socioeconomic background, i.e., education, employment status, and financial resources, not gender. Overage class enrolment is common, particularly in public schools and among boys rather than girls. National and international collective action and innovative education policies are needed for Bissau-Guinean adolescents to enjoy their right to the quality education they are entitled to.",Article,1 , International Journal of Educational Research,Jan 1,0,"

"Passion, grit and mindset of Iranian wrestlers: A socio-psychological approach","['Saeed Shamshirian', 'Vidar Halldorsson', 'Hermundur Sigmundsson']","The study presents a socio-psychological analysis of the conventional psychological concept of passion, grit and mindset among Iranian elite wrestlers, along with exploring the associations of the aforementioned variables. We conducted a cross-sectional, correlational questionnaire survey among 124 international and national Iranian top male wrestlers and recruited 106 male and female Iranian university students as a control group to provide more rationale of the variables within the context. Passion Scale, GritS Scale and Theories of Intelligence Scale (TIS) were used to measure the variables. The wrestlers scored high on the passion, grit and growth mindset scales, higher than the controls. Further analysis indicated a positive association between passion, grit and growth mindset on wrestlers as a whole and the subgroups. There were, however, no differences in terms of the level of competency and achievement within the groups of wrestlers, which counters former findings. This research contributes valuable insights into how passion, grit and growth mindset, considering the interplay between individual agency and an apt social context, sustain athletes' desire for tough training; motivate them to overcome a series of setbacks and challenging situations in order to meet further achievements in such a competitive sport. The research further provides insight into a distinctive sport culture and proposes how the socio-cultural context of athletes impacts their mentality and achievement.",Article,1 , New Ideas in Psychology,,0,"

Adolescent Vocational Interests Predict Early Career Success: Two 12-Year Longitudinal Studies,"['Kevin Hoff', 'Chu Chu', 'Sif Einarsdóttir[...]', 'James Rounds']","Vocational interests are relatively stable individual differences that can change across the life span. However, little is known about the importance of interest changes, relative to stable interest levels, for predicting career outcomes. This study assessed the long-term predictive power of adolescent interest levels and interest growth for five career outcomes: degree attainment, occupational prestige, income, career- and job-satisfaction. The study used two 12- year longitudinal samples (N1 = 485; N2 = 1,290) with vocational interests measured across multiple waves from late adolescence to young adulthood. Results from both samples converged on three key findings. First, adolescents who showed better interest fit with their eventual vocation were more satisfied with their jobs over a decade later. Second, adolescent interests predicted objective career outcomes (i.e., degree attainment, occupational prestige, and income), revealing that early interests shaped educational and career choices. Third, interest changes were typically not associated with career outcomes, indicating that adolescent interest levels played a larger role. Together, these findings highlight the critical importance of childhood and adolescent interest development for guiding career trajectories and outcomes. We discuss implications for interest development theories, educational policies, and applied interventions.",Article,1 , Applied Psychology,,1,"

Structural factors affecting community mobility for people with mobility impairments in Iceland: A human rights and occupational perspective,"['Sigrun Kristin Jonasdottir', 'Snaefridur Thora Egilson', 'Jan Polgar']","Moving between places in the community, or community mobility, is both an occupation and a means to other occupations. In order to move around and participate in society, people with mobility impairments need modifications as they encounter multiple barriers in their everyday lives. This discussion paper makes recommendations for policy development, especially as it relates to accessibility and transportation services for disabled people. This work highlights aspects that need to be incorporated into policy making to support community mobility for people with mobility impairments: (1) Incorporation of occupational values; (2) Participatory policy making; (3) Consistency and transparency in policy documents; and (4) Comprehensive monitoring system. The recommendations are discussed and reflected upon in the light of human rights, occupational science, and the Capabilities Approach. This paper highlights issues that arise at the system level and how limitations of policies and their implementation can lead to multiple capability failures and violations of human rights – such as the difficulties people with mobility impairments face if society fails to provide the necessary means to support their community mobility – and the various ways that situation may affect their other chosen occupations.",Article,1 , Journal of Occupational Science,,0,"

Collective Action and the Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: The Case of the Panama Papers Protest in Iceland,['Jón Gunnar Bernburg'],"Social theory implies that a rise in the expectation that many will participate in collective action can make participation in the action widely rational, giving rise to a ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’. I address this classic, yet understudied, proposition by surveying participation in a demonstration that the ‘Panama Papers Leak’ triggered in Iceland in 2016. The demonstration was preceded by a sudden rise of large-turnout expectations, and attracted one-fifth of an urban population, allowing me to obtain event-specific, population-representative survey measures of the focal constructs (N = 821). The findings support hypotheses about the role of large-turnout expectations in collective action. They confirm that protest support (i.e. the value placed in the goal of the collective action) both raises large-turnout expectations and moderates their effects on protest participation. In fact, large-turnout expectations were associated with participation only if individuals supported the protest. Also, the findings imply that large-protest expectations trigger interpersonal relational dynamics that further motivate participation. The study thus supports and yet qualifies the role of the self-fulfilling prophecy in collective action.",Article,1 , European Sociological Review,Oct 26,0,"

"""Nothing happens in a vacuum here"": university-industry collaboration in Iceland","['Verena Karlsdottir', 'Ingi Runar Edvardsson', 'Thamar Melanie Heijstra']","In recent years, universities have become driving forces of economic growth, and they have taken greater responsibility in economic, cultural, and social matters. Thereby, universities have placed a stronger emphasis on university-industry collaboration (UIC), which facilitates knowledge and technology transfer and frames teaching and research activities. In this article Iceland is an example to illustrate the importance of the triple helix which serves the purpose of enhancing formal UIC. The study conducts a thematic analysis of qualitative data collected in interviews with staff in universities, public research organisations, and companies. The findings show that informal modes of collaboration were prevalent and characterised by short-term orientation and reliance on social capital. The reasons for these findings could be traced to the business culture, funding structures, and the location and size of organisations in Iceland. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations to governments, universities, and industries for strengthening their collaboration.",Article,1 , International Journal of Knowledge-Based Development,Nov 22,0,"

Until now, it has not been possible to empirically examine whether this increased debate reflects a development towards a change in attitudes among the Icelandic public. The data from the Icelandic National Election Study (ICENES) shows an apparent long-term change in attitudes towards environmental issues over the past thirty years (1987-2017). Here, we analyze the results of two questions from ICENES. Firstly, we investigate attitudes concerning whether environmental issues should take precedence over efforts to increase economic growth, and, secondly, views on whether the government should place great or little emphasis on heavy industry. Similar changes are seen over time; the proportion of those who want to prioritize environmental issues increases year by year (with one exception immediately after the economic crisis), and the proportion of those who want the government to emphasize heavy industry decreases. The last survey (2017) found that 65% of respondents prioritized environmental issues above economic growth, and 80% wanted the government to place little emphasis on heavy industry. People who identified with a left political party where more likely to emphasize environmental issues whereas those who identified with a right political party where more likely to emphasize heavy industry.",Article,1 , Icelandic Review of Politics & Administration,,0,"

Local knowledge of emerging hazards: Instability above an Icelandic glacier,"['Stephanie Matti', 'Helga Ögmundardottir']","Climate change is contributing to shifts in the magnitude and scale of hazards, and the emergence of risks in areas where they were previously unknown. In south-east Iceland, a fracture in the mountainside of Svínafellsheiði threatens to cause between 60 and 100 million cubic metres of rock to fall onto the glacier below. A large landslide could break up the surface of the glacier, crash into the proglacial lake, and affect people and infrastructure downhill. In addition to the unprecedented scale, the Svínafellsheiði fracture represents the first time people and infrastructure have been exposed to this type of hazard in Iceland. In this article we examine the role of local knowledge in disaster risk reduction and management for communities that are facing a particular type of hazard for the first time. We argue that even when a community lacks experience with a specific type of hazard, local knowledge can still play a valuable role in hazard identification and risk management.",Article,1 , International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,Mar 29,1,"

Objectives: This study aims to examine whether gender differences exist in teenage work accidents, the level of the accidents, their causes, and the types of the injuries. Methods: A survey was sent to a sample of 2,800 13-19-year-olds, randomly selected from Registers Iceland. The response rate was 48.6%. A chi-square test, CI 95%, was applied to measure gender differences. Results: In total, 16.3%of the respondents had at least one work accident, and 1.2%, an accident that lead to more than one week's absence from work. No gender differences were observed in the level of the accidents, but appeared in the types of injuries and their causes. Cuts were the most common injuries of the boys, but burns of the girls. Bone fractures were the most serious injuries of the boys, but sprains of the girls. Conclusion: Work accidents among teenagers are a particular threat to public health. Therefore, all stakeholders need to work together to prevent teenage work accidents in the future; and to keep in mind the gender diversity of the group.",Article,1 , Work,Aug 2,0,"

“We at least say we are equal”: Gender equality and class in healthcare professionals’ discursive framing of migrant mothers,"['Sunna Símonardóttir', 'Annadis Rudolfsdottir', 'Helga Gottfredsdottir']","In the last few decades, the demography of Iceland has become increasingly diverse with an immigrant population similar to that of the other Nordic countries. Women comprise almost half of all international migrants and many of those female migrants require maternity care in their host countries. While some literature describes how migrant women experience the healthcare provisions of their host countries, less is known about the experience of providing the service, from the perspective of the healthcare practitioners. In this study we adopt a social constructionist perspective to explore the discourses of knowledge healthcare professionals in Iceland draw on in their discussion of prenatal and postpartum healthcare in Iceland. Interviews were conducted with 16 healthcare professionals with extensive experience of providing maternity care to migrant women to understand how they construct and make sense of the needs and behaviour of migrant women seeking maternity care. Our findings suggest that some healthcare professionals subject migrant women to normative professional discourses of parenting, without considering how those ideals are tailored to white, middle class women. Migrant mothers and pregnant women are thus excluded from the middle-class mothering norms that are ascribed to Icelandic women. Our findings also highlight how national identity, such as being part of a gender equal society and the image of Iceland as a classless society, influe

"Whale Ecosystem Services and Co-production Processes Underpinning Human Wellbeing in the Arctic: Case Studies from Greenland, Iceland and Norway","['Laura Malinauskaite', 'David Cook', 'Brynhildur Davidsdottir', 'Helga Ögmundardottir']","The concept of ecosystem services (ES) has only just begun to be applied in the Arctic, and to an even lesser extent to marine mammals, such as whales. This chapter develops an ES cascade model and related ES co-production processes as they apply to whale resources in the Arctic. The result is a new conceptual model demonstrating the interconnectedness of social-ecological processes involving natural and human capital that enhance human wellbeing through the co-creation of whale ES. An ES cascade model is presented for whale ES, which connects the five linked stages of such ES production: the biophysical structure, functions, ecosystem services, the benefits to human wellbeing, and associated values. They are further expanded to include the co-production processes of whale ES as well as its main stages, inputs, and flows. These processes are illustrated using examples from ARCPATH case studies of coastal communities dependent on whale resources: Húsavík in Iceland, Andenes in Norway, and Ilulissat/Disko Bay in Greenland. The chapter aims to improve the understanding of the human dimensions of ES and the underlying processes that enable Arctic coastal communities to benefit from whales. It provides a starting point for further analysis of possible research and management approaches regarding whale resources in the Arctic.",Chapter,,,Jan 1,0,"

"Gender, agency, and time use among doctorate holders: The case of Iceland","['Maya Staub', 'Gudbjorg Linda Rafnsdottir']","This article investigates how doctorate holders in Iceland make sense of time and utilize their own time management as an instrument in their career development and whether gender is a defining factor in this context. The project is based on 32 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with participants holding 5- to 20-year-old doctorate degrees in Iceland. These interviews were then analyzed using a phenomenological approach. The results indicate that the men generally felt a higher level of agency regarding their work–life balance and time management than did the women, who more often expressed difficulties finding a proper balance and expressed being more stressed about the often fragmented time they had to combine their career and family obligations successfully. The study provides a picture of how societal time norms among highly educated people are very gendered and how time is still inevitably linked to power. The contribution of this study to prior studies is that, even when comparing highly educated people among whom it is more likely to find a higher level of egalitarian attitudes, in a country where gender equality is assumed to be at a higher level than in many other countries, women still seem to experience time differently from men in terms of personal autonomy.",Article,9 , Time & Society,,0,"

In light of this, questions remain both on what the international community could have done differently for the cause of a peaceful change in Belarus and how to move forward. In light of this, the policy brief “Baltic and Nordic Responses to the 2020 Post-Election Crisis in Belarus” takes on and compares the reactions of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden in light of the Belarus 2020 post-election crisis and assesses implications for the bilateral and multilateral cooperation of the Baltics and Nordics with Belarus.",Book,,,,0,"

"Nordic folk legends, folk traditions and grave mounds The value of folkloristics for the study of Old Nordic religions",['Terry Gunnell'],"his article examines the potential value of folkloristic research approaches and nineteenth-century folkloristic material for the study of Old Nordic religions and pre-Christian beliefs and rituals in the Nordic area. Starting with a short introduction to the nature of folklore, and the important role played by folklore and the oral tradition in the pre-literate (and early literate) Nordic world, it simultaneously stresses the folkloric nature of Old Nordic religions and the extant sources regarding them. The article concludes with a short case-study of Norwegian traditions involving offerings made to farm grave mounds in the nineteenth century, demonstrating that both the practice and the beliefs and legends attached to it not only underline the continuing sacral value of the grave mound for local people, but also potentially reflect early beliefs in ancestral spirits which the Church failed to eradicate.",Conference Paper,4 , FF Communications,,0,"

Curatorial Research as Boundary Work,['Ólöf Sigfúsdóttir'],"Curatorial research is a new field only emerging in the last few years within museological discourse. The notion of curating as research offers useful suggestions on how to escape historically induced binary oppositions between theory and practice, the academic and the artistic. Moreover, curatorial research instigates critical questions on the significance of knowledge production in the context of public museums, particularly the relationship between research, display and museum audience. This article explores different notions of curatorial research as they emerge through current museological discourse. Three models of curatorial research are identified, each conveying a distinct – yet related – understanding of knowledge production through curatorial practice in the museum setting. The article then uses the exhibition In Between as a case to explore these models further. Building on the analysis of the case and the three models, a fourth research model is proposed. The new model is based on the concept of “boundary work”, emphasising the multiple epistemological contributions curatorial research entails as it traverses borders between the domains of science and culture, thereby blurring the distinctions between theory and practice, the discursive and the immersive, the systematic and the creative.",Article,1 , Curator The Museum Journal,,0,"

Fisheries management on Lake Victoria at cross-roads: Assessing fishers' perceptions on future management options in Uganda.,"['Veronica Mpomwenda', 'Dadi Kristofersson', 'Jon Geir Petursson', 'Tumi Tómasson']","Fishers’ perceptions on the state of fisheries and the applicable fisheries management system in Lake Victoria (LV), Uganda, were assessed. Fisheries management in the lake is currently at a crossroads. The government abolished a co-management system in November 2015 and installed the military to temporary enforce management. The objective of this study was to explore how fishers envisage future management options by assessing past management regimes and analysing perceptions of alternative regimes. A total of 273 semi-structured interviews at six selected landing sites on LV in Uganda were conducted. Fishers targeted two dominant species, Nile perch, Lates niloticus (L.), mainly on motorised vessels representing the commercial fishers and dagaa, Rastrineobola argentea (Pellegrin), using both motorised and paddled vessels. The dominance of motorised fishing vessels depicted a consequence of the army operations and represents government priority to protect rather than regulate commercial fishing operations. Fishers mainly perceived regulations they knew about as effective, strongly opposed local governments as a management entity and assigned management to fisher groups as expected. The results support a management regime of key resource users organised by common interest groups to participate in decision-making and combined government structures to regulate and enforce sustainable fisheries measures.",Article,1 , Fisheries Management and Ecology,Dec 2,0,"

Bears are iconic animals, playing a variety of roles in human culture. The essays collected here provide a rich selection of views on the human/bear relationships. They explore how bears are an influence in contemporary art, and how they are represented in the illustrations in children's literature and in museum exhibitions. The connection between bears and native peoples, and how contemporary society lives alongside these animals, provides an understanding of current attitudes and approaches to bear management and conservation. The history of captive bears is brought into contemporary relief by considering the fate of captive bears held in Asian countries for bile production.

Timing of paediatric orchidopexy in universal healthcare systems: international administrative data cohort study,"['Matthew A Jay', 'Arzu Arat', 'L. Wijlaars[...]', 'R. Gilbert']","Background: International guidelines in 2008 recommended orchidopexy for undescended testis at 6-12 months of age to reduce the risk of testicular cancer and infertility. Using administrative data from England, Finland, Ontario (Canada), Scotland and Sweden (with data from Victoria (Australia) and Iceland in supplementary analyses), the aim of this study was to investigate compliance with these guidelines and identify potential socioeconomic inequities in the timing of surgery before 1 and 3 years. Methods: All boys born in 2003-2011 with a diagnosis code of undescended testis and procedure codes indicating orchidopexy before their fifth birthday were identified from administrative health records. Trends in the proportion of orchidopexies performed before 1 and 3 years of age were investigated, as were socioeconomic inequities in adherence to the guidelines. Results: Across all jurisdictions, the proportion of orchidopexies occurring before the first birthday increased over the study period. By 2011, from 7·6 per cent (Sweden) to 27·9 per cent (Scotland) of boys had undergone orchidopexy by their first birthday and 71·5 per cent (Sweden) to 90·4 per cent (Scotland) by 3 years of age. There was limited evidence of socioeconomic inequities for orchidopexy before the introduction of guidelines (2008). Across all jurisdictions for boys born after 2008, there was consistent evidence of inequities in orchidopexy by the first birthday, favouring higher socioeconomic position.

Following up on our genome-wide scan of basal cell carcinoma, we found that rs401681[C] on chromosome 5p15.33 satisfied our threshold for genome-wide significance (OR = 1.25, P = 3.7 x 10(-12)). We tested rs401681 for association with 16 additional cancer types in over 30,000 cancer cases and 45,000 controls and found association with lung cancer (OR = 1.15, P = 7.2 x 10(-8)) and urinary bladder, prostate and cervix cancer (ORs = 1.07-1.31, all P < 4 x 10(-4)). However, rs401681[C] seems to confer protection against cutaneous melanoma (OR = 0.88, P = 8.0 x 10(-4)). Notably, most of these cancer types have a strong environmental component to their risk. Investigation of the region led us to rs2736098[A], which showed stronger association with some cancer types. However, neither variant could fully account for the association of the other. rs2736098 corresponds to A305A in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) protein and rs401681 is in an intron of the CLPTM1L gene.",Article,9 , Nature Genetics,,1,"

It is part of a larger research project that investigates the gap between policy ideals and service provision for young disabled children and their families in Iceland. Contrary to ofcial policies, earlier fndings based on the families’ perspectives reported strain and stress from fragmented and inﬂexible services. The fndings presented here are based on three focus-group interviews, conducted with 13 professionals from six disciplines. The aim was to capture their views on their roles, responsibilities, and working conditions. A number of organisational and professional barriers were exposed along with an overall lack of awareness of the basic principles of family-centred services and the human rights relational approach to disability.

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the life of Bissau-Guinean religious (Quranic) schoolboys during a state of emergency: a qualitative study,"['Boiro Hamadou', 'Jónína Einarsdóttir', 'Geir Gunnlaugsson']","Background COVID-19 is mainly a disease of adults but can affect vulnerable children indirectly through social containment measures. The study aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on the lives of Quranic schoolboys, almudos , who beg on behalf of their teachers, chernos, in Guinea-Bissau. Methods Data were collected in July 2020 during a state of emergency. Data rest on semistructured interviews with 14 almudos and observations. The almudos , aged 12–16 years, were identified in the capital Bissau and the regional centre Gabú. Results Four interconnected themes were found. The first, hardship, was brought by the COVID-19 pandemic and caused by lockdown and police threats, resulting in a decrease in alms and hunger. The second, circumvention of calamity, included preventive measures the boys undertook and concerns with crowdedness impeding social distancing. Relations with others is the third theme. These had changed with sharply reduced contacts with neighbours and other providers of alms. The parents had more frequent telephone contact with their sons, and encouraged them to continue their studies. At the same time, the chernos and almudos passed more time together, and they dedicated more time than earlier to the studies and prayers. The fourth theme has to do with the boys’ concerns about their long-term aspirations—to complete their studies and become respected chernos , for which begging was seen as an integral part. Conclusion The almudos suffered from decrease

"Pots and Pans Pro-Democracy Protest in Iceland (forthcoming in Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Social and Political Movements, 2nd Edition)",['Jón Gunnar Bernburg'],"This entry discusses the “Pots and Pans Revolution” in Iceland, a wave of popular protest that evolved in Iceland after the global financial crisis triggered a joint collapse of the country’s three major banks in October 2008. The protest started as a series of “town meetings” challenging the authorities’ framing of the collapse and its enormous impact on the state budget and the country’s economy as simply being a part of a “global financial storm” (Bernburg, 2016). The alternative frame that emerged at the meetings was that the crisis exposed misrepresentation, corruption, and privilege and thus called for mass civil action to create a pressure on the politics to reform (starting with the immediate resignation of the ruling, center-right government). During the unfolding of the financial crisis, in fall 2008, participation by the general public in the protest meetings grew rapidly and the expanding protest platform encouraged activists to perform increasingly radical acts of contention. Eventually, in January 2009, after a few, consecutive days of pots and pans protest, which attracted a quarter of the population of the country’s major urban area (Bernburg, 2015), the government resigned.",Preprint,,,,0,"

Life Quality and Participation of Disabled Children and Young People: Design and Methods of a Transformative Study,"['Snaefridur Thora Egilson', 'Linda Björk Ólafsdóttir', 'Anna Sigrun Ingimarsdottir[...]', 'Stefan Hardonk']","The LIFE-DCY research project has two aims. First, to evaluate disabled children’s quality of life (QoL) as reported by themselves and their parents, and second, to locate commonalities, differences, and conflicting issues in the processes that may influence disabled children’s life quality and participation. This paper describes the study design, methodology, and methods along with lessons learned. In addition various methodological and ethical concerns are raised. A sequential mixed-methods design was applied. In Phase one (mapping) we used KIDSCREEN-27 to study how disabled children evaluate their QoL compared with the perspectives of their parents and those of non-disabled children and their parents. Using the Participation and environment measure we also studied parents’ perspectives of their children’s participation in different social contexts. Altogether 209 disabled children and their parents, and 335 children in a control group and their parents (paired reports) participated in phase one. Phase two (unpacking) consisted of 14 case studies with disabled children aged 8–18 years and focus groups with 21 disabled people aged 19–35 years. The initial analysis was inductive and data-oriented. We then used critical and transformative lenses to shed light on how meaning was made of life quality and participation in relation to the context in which study participants found themselves.

Iceland and Foreign Aid: From Recipient to Donor,"['Geir Gunnlaugsson', 'Þórdís Sigurðardóttir', 'Margrét Einarsdóttir', 'Jónína Einarsdóttir']","Iceland came under the jurisdiction of the Norwegian King in 1262 to later become a colony of Denmark for about 500 years. Already in the second half of the 18th century, the Danish king initiated actions that aimed to improve the precarious situation of the Icelandic population. After independence in 1944, Iceland enjoyed the highest per capita support of the Marchall Plan (European Recovery Program) following World War II. Thereafter Iceland received aid and loans from the World Bank according to which Iceland was a developing country until 1976. In 1981, the Icelandic International Development Agency (Iceida) was established, substituting the office for Iceland´s Assistance to the Developing Countries, and since 2013 it is a formal member of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD. Iceida and now Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has in recent years been engaged in bilateral collaboration with mostly three countries, one of which is Malawi. The aim of the chapter is to describe and analyze the transformation of Iceland from a net receiver of foreign aid to a donor country, with particular attention given to its involvement in Mangochi District in Malawi in Southern-Africa. From early engagement within the fishing sector at the shores of Lake Malawi in the early 1990s, the focus of the collaboration in the area moved to health services, water-and-sanitation, primary education, and social sector initiatives, later expanded to district-wide support.

Fit Gets Better: A Longitudinal Study of Changes in Interest Fit in Educational and Work Environments,"['Alexis Hanna', 'Daniel A Briley', 'Sif Einarsdóttir[...]', 'James Rounds']","Theories of person-environment (P-E) fit describe a dynamic process in which fit should improve over time due to changes in a person’s attributes, the environment, or both. Although these ideas are central in several theoretical perspectives, they have largely gone untested. Here, we report a longitudinal examination of interest congruence (i.e., interest fit) across 12 years during the transition from education to the workforce. The study uses four methods to capture interest congruence and the drivers of fit change: growth models, latent congruence models, person and environment latent difference scores, and piecewise growth models based on environmental transitions. Each method uses a different lens to understand interest congruence in educational and work domains. Across methods, three results were typically found: (1) interest congruence improved over time in school and at work, (2) participants’ interests often predicted educational and work changes, and (3) participants’ interests rarely changed in response to their environment. These results support a dynamic conceptualization of fit and suggest that selection—rather than socialization—is the main mechanism through which individuals achieve better interest fit during young adulthood. Other implications are discussed for theory development and the applied use of interest assessments.",Preprint,,,Mar 20,0,"

“This Would Never be Possible if Not for Our Team Play”: An Analysis of Icelandic Doctorate Earnings from a Gender Perspective,"['Maya Staub', 'Thamar Melanie Heijstra']","At the international level, Iceland is faring well on gender assessments concerning economic status, political position, education, and health. However, these rankings fail to assess what is happening within the private sphere regarding gender equality. We argue that research on the interplay between the domestic and public spheres is important because these overlapping fields affect the lives of women and men differently. By focusing on the earnings of doctorate holders in Iceland, we aim to obtain a better understanding of the gendered meaning and implications of found earnings inequalities. Relying on longitudinal population register data, as well as 32 in-depth interviews with doctorate holders, we find that the men earn significantly more than the women. While the quantitative model only explains a small part of the inequality, the qualitative findings indicate that decisions made within the household, referred to as team play, negotiation, and choices, play a defining role in post-doctorate career development. We conclude that, despite the male breadwinner model being outdated in Icelandic society, some of its pillar thoughts still persist beneath the surface, keeping gender inequality within the household in place.",Article,1 , Journal of Family and Economic Issues,Aug 12,0,"

This material suggests that we should be very careful before assuming that “rational” attitudes to the supernatural had become widespread among the learned who had all grown up in candlelight amid the deeply engrained beliefs of their forefathers.

An international football match experienced from within a 'working quarantine' -a photographic journey,['Vidar Halldorsson'],"The Covid pandemic has affected contemporary lives to unprecedented levels, including the world of sports, which have faced training and competition bans, matches and tournaments having been postponed or cancelled. However, the Union of the European Football Associations (UEFA) was keen to continue playing despite the pandemic and staged matches played behind closed doors. Thus, UEFA provided the involved parties with a strict protocol of how to organise and conduct matches in order to protect players and staff from contracting the virus, as well as to limit the risk of spreading the virus. This study provides a visual auto-ethnographical account of a European qualifier match between the women´s national teams of Iceland and Sweden. The match took place in September 2020, in the midst of the second wave of the Covid pandemic which was sweeping through Europe at the time. This visual story illustrates how the Covid pandemic was experienced in a team working quarantine and how it affected the social organisation of the match as shown by established rules and recommendations for human conduct and manifested in new norms of behaviour. The visual story further highlights how the pandemic imposed unprecedented challenges for sport teams to settle the conflicting forces of how to withhold manifested and collective team rituals under such constrains, as for the social organisations, which had to make-up protocols, at short notice, in order to keep the virus at bay.

The sociological theory of craftsmanship: An empirical test in sport and education,"['Thorolfur Thorlindsson', 'Vidar Halldorsson', 'I.D. Sigfusdottir']","The aim of this study is to test empirically the sociological theory of craftsmanship originally developed by C. Wright Mills, Torstein Veblen, and Howard Becker and later extended by Harper, Sennett, and Fine. We conduct a quantitative analysis based on a nationally representative sample of 10,783 Icelandic adolescents (50.2% girls). We developed a scale measuring craftsmanship that we use to test several hypotheses regarding the role of craftsmanship in sport and education. Our findings provide a consistent empirical support for the theory of craftsmanship. First, they indicate that elements of the craftsmanship theory that have been identified by prior qualitative research go together as predicted to form a coherent theoretical construct and a measurement scale that is both reliable and valid. The craftsmanship scale therefore offers good opportunities for quantitative research in an area that has been exclusively qualitative. Second, our findings indicate that, as predicted, the craftsmanship approach makes schoolwork more meaningful and reduces general feelings of meaninglessness. Third, the findings show, as predicted, that the craftsmanship approach influences school performance in a positive way. Fourth, we find that the positive relationship between sport participation and school performance is in part mediated by craftsmanship. Finally, the findings show that the influence of craftsmanship on school performance is in part mediated by meaninglessness. We discuss the implicat

Co-production processes underpinning the ecosystem services of glaciers and adaptive management in the era of climate change,"['David Cook', 'Laura Malinauskaite', 'Brynhildur Davidsdottir', 'Helga Ögmundardottir']","Glaciers have been an increasingly studied topic in the ecosystem services (ES) literature, with multiple scientific studies affirming a critical and diverse contribution to human well-being. However, the literature to date on glacier ES has lacked a systematic analysis of their type and the various stages in the formation of glacier ES, including the linkages between biophysical structures and ecological processes to human values, benefits and well-being. This paper begins to fill this gap by (1) detailing the first Common International Classification for Ecosystem Services classification of ES specific to glaciers; and (2) constructing an ES cascade model specific to the ES of glaciers, integrating four main stages of co-production: value attribution, mobilisation of ES potential, value appropriation, and commercialisation. In both stages, examples from the academic and grey literature are highlighted. Based on a systematic literature review, a total of 15 ES are identified, categorised as follows: provisioning (2), regulation and maintenance (6), and cultural (7). Apart from abiotic regulation and maintenance ES, it is evident that human interventions are necessary in order to mobilise, appropriate and commercialise several glacier ES, including freshwater for drinking, hydropower generation, recreation and education. Rapidly intensifying climate change has led to intense focus on the initial co-production process of value attribution and identification of dynamic ES potential, with a view to maximising commercial b

We employed a mixed-methods design to explore and compare parent perspectives on (1) participation of children with and without autism spectrum disorder in activities at home, (2) the environmental features and resources that affect these children’s home participation and (3) the strategies parents use to help their children participate at home. The Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth (PEM-CY) was used to gather online survey and qualitative data from parents of 99 high-functioning children with autism spectrum disorder and 241 children without autism spectrum disorder. Independent sample t-tests and χ² tests were used to explore differences between groups, and Cohen’s d was calculated to examine effect sizes. Differences were obtained on all Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth dimensions but particularly when comparing parents’ satisfaction and perceived environmental barriers to their children’s participation. The qualitative analyses revealed that parents in both groups used similar strategies to facilitate their children’s participation at home, although parents of children with autism spectrum disorder made use of more distinct modifications. Our results highlight the importance of environmental aspects and point to how practitioners can support families in their efforts to promote their child’s participation at home.",Article,7 , Autism,,1,"

A survey was conducted to evaluate the disposition of respondents to the relative prioritisation of security over civil liberties. The results indicate that even in a rather secure setting, where threats from terror can be considered relatively distant, citizens have a disposition towards prioritising security, although this depends on the degree of anxiety, political trust and general social trust. Anxiety leads to greater willingness to accept infringements, as does trust in government while general social trust leads to smaller receptiveness in this respect.",Article,1 , Icelandic Review of Politics & Administration,Jun 30,1,"

Skógræktaröldin: Samanteknar tölur úr Ársriti Skógræktarfélags Íslands [The first 100 years of tree planting in Iceland],['Jon Geir Petursson'],"English summary THE FIRST 100 YEARS OF TREE PLANTING IN ICELAND This year, the 100 year's anniversary of tree planting is celebrated in Iceland. The year 1899 the first successful attempt was made to establish new forest by planting forest tree seedlings in an extensive area. This article presents the number of forest tree seedlings produced and planted annually in Iceland last hundred years. The general trends are discussed as well as the main tree species used. The main results are that the total number of forest tree seedlings planted in Icelandic soils are approximately 75-80 million. Ten tree species stand for about 90% of the plantings; Russian larch (22%), native downy birch (21%), lodgepole pine (15%), Sitka spruce (14%), Norway spruce (6%), Scots pine (4%), Siberian larch (4%), Engelman spruce (3%), mountain pine (3%) and black cottonwood (2%)",Article,,,,0,"

Agreements and disagreements between children and their parents in health-related assessments,"['Helena Hemmingsson', 'Linda Björk Ólafsdóttir', 'Snaefridur Thora Egilson']","Purpose: To systematically review research concerning parent-child agreement in health-related assessments to reveal overall agreement, directions of agreement, and the factors that affect agreement in ratings. Method: The Uni-Search and five additional databases were searched. Children's health issues were grouped into psychosocial issues including autism and ADHD, and physical and performance issues including pain. Measures used for comparison were those addressing (a) psychosocial functioning, (b) physical and performance functioning, and (c) health-related quality of life. Results: Totally, 39 studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 44 analyses in all since four studies contained more than one analyses. Moderate child-parent agreement was demonstrated in 23 analyses and poor agreement in 20 analyses. Several analyses found more agreement on observable/external than on non-observable/internal domains. Overall, parents considered their children had more difficulties than did the children themselves, although there were indications that for children with physical performance issues, parents may underreport their children's difficulties in emotional functioning and pain. There were no consistencies in differences between children's and parent's ratings on levels of agreement with respect to the children's health issue, age or gender. Conclusions: Discrepancies between child and parent reports seem to reflect their different perspectives and not merely inaccurac

The Dynamics of Managerial Succession: The social aspects of contemporary football (MA thesis),['Vidar Halldorsson'],"This study focuses on the contemporary football manager with emphasis on managerial succession in football. First, a statistical analysis on the Icelandic Premier Football League was made in order to evaluate the frequency of managerial succession and job-tenure of football managers. Second, interviews with football managers and various football related resources were used to gain a more adequate understanding for the reasons and consequences of managerial succession in football. The findings show that the job of the football manager is complex and problematic and that managerial succession is frequent in contemporary football. In-season managerial changes are made when team efficiency is low and the findings also actuate the importance of the football managers for their clubs since results tend to improve considerably for low-efficient teams that make in-season managerial change. The findings further suggest that football managers experience what Merton described as ´anomie´ in their jobs. The cultural goals in contemporary sports are out of reach for most football clubs with the structural means provided. Finally, it is argued that ´anomie´ is one of the main reasons for frequent managerial succession in contemporary football.",Thesis,,,,0,"

Is Co-Management Still Feasible to Advance the Sustainability of Small-Scale African Inland Fisheries? Assessing Stakeholders' Perspectives in Zambia,"['Sydney Kapembwa', 'Jon Geir Petursson', 'Alan J Gardiner']","Co-management has been promoted as an alternative approach to the governance of small-scale inland fisheries resources and has been implemented in many African countries. It has, however, not proven to be a simple solution to improve their governance; hence, most African inland fisheries are still experiencing unsustainable overexploitation of their resources. As such, there is a need for reassessing the application of governance strategies for co-management that should strive to strengthen the participation of stakeholders, primarily the local fishers, as they are fundamental in the governance of fisheries resources. Therefore, this study set out to explore the prospects of a co-management governance approach at a Lake Itezhi-Tezhi small-scale fishery in Zambia. Focus group discussions with fishers and semi-structured interviews with other stakeholders were used to collect data. This study revealed that the stakeholders perceive co-management as a feasible approach to governance of the Lake Itezhi-Tezhi fishery. However, the feasibility of the co-management arrangement would be dependent mostly on the stakeholders’ ability to address most of the ‘key conditions’ criteria highlighted in the study. This study also identified the need to establish a fisheries policy to provide guidelines for the co-management, coming with decentralisation of power and authority to the local fishers.",Article,1 , Sustainability,,1,"

Understanding Disability Throughout History: Interdisciplinary Perspectives in Iceland from Settlement to 1936,"['Hanna Sigurjónsdóttir', 'James Rice']","Understanding Disability Throughout History explores seldom-heard voices from the past by studying the hidden lives of disabled people before the concept of disability existed culturally, socially and administratively. The book focuses on Iceland from the Age of Settlement, traditionally considered to have taken place from 874 to 930, until the 1936 Law on Social Security (Lög um almannatryggingar), which is the first time that disabled people were referenced in Iceland as a legal or administrative category. Data sources analysed in the project represent a broad range of materials that are not often featured in the study of disability, such as bone collections, medieval literature and census data from the early modern era, archaeological remains, historical archives, folktales and legends, personal narratives and museum displays. The ten chapters include contributions from multidisciplinary team of experts working in the fields of Disability Studies, History, Archaeology, Medieval Icelandic Literature, Folklore and Ethnology, Anthropology, Museum Studies, and Archival Sciences, along with a collection of post-doctoral and graduate students. The volume will be of interest to all scholars and students of disability studies, history, medieval studies, ethnology, folklore, and archaeology.",Book,,,,1,"

"Child Protection, Disability and Obstetric Violence: Three Case Studies from Iceland","['James Rice', 'Helga Baldvins Bjargardóttir', 'Hanna Sigurjónsdóttir']","This contribution is a collective re-analysis of three research projects in Iceland focused on parenting with a disability which draws upon data spanning a twenty-year period. The core purpose of these projects is to understand why parents with primarily intellectual disabilities encounter such difficulties with the child protection system. Our aim with this contribution is to identify, through a longitudinal and comparative framework, why these difficulties persist despite a changing disability rights environment. A case study methodology has been employed highlighting three cases, one from each research project, which focus narrowly on disabled parents’ struggles with the child protection system in the context of the maternity ward. The findings, framed in the concept of structural violence, indicate poor working practices on the part of healthcare and child protection, a lack of trust, and that context is still ignored in favour of disability as the explanatory framework for the perceived inadequacies of the parents. We contend that child protection authorities continue to remain out of step with developments in disability and human rights. The contribution concludes to make a case as to why the concept of obstetric violence is a useful framework for criticism and advocacy work in this area",Article,1 , International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Dec 31, 2020",0,"

"Co-Management of Protected Areas: A Governance System Analysis of Vatnajökull National Park, Iceland","['Jon Geir Petursson', 'Dadi Kristofersson']","Land allocated to protected areas (PA) is expanding as are expectations about the services these areas deliver. There is a need to advance knowledge on PA governance systems, like co-management, recognising that there is no ""one-size-fits-all"" solution. We analyse the co-management governance system and performance of Vatnajökull National Park (VNP), Iceland. We adapt an analytical framework from the literature on environmental governance and analyse its governance system, hence actor roles, institutional arrangements and interactions. Our findings illustrate that the co-management structure was an outcome of political negotiations and a response to the lack of legitimacy of its predecessors; resulting in a tailor-made governance system set out in park-specific legislation. Although the performance is quite positive, being adaptive to changes, inclusive, promoting rural development and an appreciated facilitator of devolution and power-sharing, it has come with challenges. It has encountered problems delineating responsibilities among its actors, causing conflict and confusion; in settling conflicting localised issues close to local stakeholders, there have been capacity issues. We argue that the VNP co-management system is fit for its purpose, aligned with Icelandic land-use governance structures but in need of systematic improvements. There are important lessons as Iceland seeks to expand its PA estate and beyond, since the global community is setting ambitious policy goals t

"Fairy tales, copyright, and the public domain",['Valdimar Hafstein'],"In 1873, an ailing Hans Christian Andersen traveled to Switzerland, where he sought treatment at a spa in Glion, high above Lake Geneva, drinking daily doses of whey - a cure that brought affluent people from all over Europe to Swiss resorts. The whey did nothing for him. Not surprising considering that two years later he died of a cancer from which he was in all likelihood already suffering. A family from Hamburg stayed in the room directly above him, a Mr. Mai, his wife, and their young daughter. Andersen kept company with them, among other guests in the spa, and on Thursday, May 29, he records in his diary: The weather doesn’t look promising today either. I slept with many interruptions, but slept nonetheless. My ringworm itches constantly and I have many small liver spots on my legs, what does that mean? A letter from Mrs. Melchior and from Simon Henriques. A visit from Mr. Mai, who maintained that the story about ""What the Old Man Does"" was taken from Grimm. I told him it was a Danish folktale and that Grimm had never composed a fairy tale, he was only a collector… I am not in a good mood. ""What the Old Man Does Is Always Right"" appeared in 1861 in the second series of Andersen’s New Fairy Tales and Stories. By this time, Andersen was easily Scandinavia’s most famous author, internationally acclaimed for his fairy tales that had already been translated many times into a number of languages. In introductory remarks to a complete collection of his tales published in 1874, a year after Mr. Mai’s

Genome-wide association study identifies sequence variants on 6q21 associated with age at menarche,"['Patrick Sulem', 'Daníel Fannar Guðbjartsson', 'Thorunn Rafnar[...]', 'Kari Stefansson']","Earlier menarche correlates with shorter adult height and higher childhood body fat. We conducted a genome-wide association study of age at menarche (AAM) on 15,297 Icelandic women. Combined analysis with replication sets from Iceland, Denmark and the Netherlands (N = 10,040) yielded a significant association between rs314280[T] on 6q21, near the LIN28B gene, and AAM (effect = 1.2 months later per allele; P = 1.8 × 10(-14)). A second SNP within the same linkage disequilibrium (LD) block, rs314277, splits rs314280[T] into two haplotypes with different effects (0.9 months and 1.9 months per allele). These variants have been associated with greater adult height. The association with adult height did not account for the association with AAM or vice versa. Other variants, previously associated with height, did not associate significantly with AAM. Given the link between body fat and AAM, we also assessed 11 variants recently associated with higher body mass index (BMI) and 5 of those associated with earlier AAM.",Article,9 , Nature Genetics,,0,"

Common variants on 9q22.33 and 14q13.3 predispose to thyroid cancer in European populations,"['Julius Gudmundsson', 'Patrick Sulem', 'Daníel Fannar Guðbjartsson[...]', 'Kari Stefansson']","In order to search for sequence variants conferring risk of thyroid cancer we conducted a genome-wide association study in 192 and 37,196 Icelandic cases and controls, respectively, followed by a replication study in individuals of European descent. Here we show that two common variants, located on 9q22.33 and 14q13.3, are associated with the disease. Overall, the strongest association signals were observed for rs965513 on 9q22.33 (OR = 1.75; P = 1.7 x 10(-27)) and rs944289 on 14q13.3 (OR = 1.37; P = 2.0 x 10(-9)). The gene nearest to the 9q22.33 locus is FOXE1 (TTF2) and NKX2-1 (TTF1) is among the genes located at the 14q13.3 locus. Both variants contribute to an increased risk of both papillary and follicular thyroid cancer. Approximately 3.7% of individuals are homozygous for both variants, and their estimated risk of thyroid cancer is 5.7-fold greater than that of noncarriers. In a study on a large sample set from the general population, both risk alleles are associated with low concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and the 9q22.33 allele is associated with low concentration of thyroxin (T(4)) and high concentration of triiodothyronine (T(3)).",Article,9 , Nature Genetics,,1,"
