Perceptions of the appropriate response to norm violation in 57 societies,"['Kimmo Ericsson', 'Pontus Strimling', 'Michele Gelfand[...]', 'Paul A M Van Lange']","Norm enforcement may be important for resolving conflicts and promoting cooperation. However, little is known about how preferred responses to norm violations vary across cultures and across domains. In a preregistered study of 57 countries (using convenience samples of 22,863 students and non-students), we measured perceptions of the appropriateness of various responses to a violation of a cooperative norm and to atypical social behaviors. Our findings highlight both cultural universals and cultural variation. We find a universal negative relation between appropriateness ratings of norm violations and appropriateness ratings of responses in the form of confrontation, social ostracism and gossip. Moreover, we find the country variation in the appropriateness of sanctions to be consistent across different norm violations but not across different sanctions. Specifically, in those countries where use of physical confrontation and social ostracism is rated as less appropriate, gossip is rated as more appropriate.",Article,,,,0,"

The Palgrave Handbook of Family Sociology in Europe,"['Anna-Maija Castrén', 'Isabella Crespi', 'Gauthier Jacques-Antoine[...]', 'Vida Cesnuityte']","‘The handbook provides an excellent blend of reassessment and reflection on what we know and how we know about families and intimate lives in Europe. Critical overviews and new insights are offered across a carefully chosen range of starting points.’ —Lynn Jamieson, Professor of Sociology, University of Edinburgh, UK, and series editor for Palgrave Macmillan Studies in Family and Intimate Life ‘This handbook is an excellent compendium of recent scholarship on the sociology of the family by European scholars. It will be a valuable resource for American scholars who wish to keep up with the best research in Europe.’ —Andrew Cherlin, Professor of Sociology and Public Policy, Johns Hopkins University, USA This handbook provides a meaningful overview of topical themes within family sociology as an academic field as well as empirical realities in various societal contexts across Europe. More than sixty prominent European scholars’ original texts present the field’s main theoretical and methodological approaches in addition to issues such as families as relationships, parental arrangements, parenting practices and child well-being, family policies in welfare state regimes, family lives in migration, and family trajectories. Presenting cutting-edge research on findings, theoretical interpretations, and solutions to methodological challenges, it is a timely tool for researchers, teachers, students, and family practitioners who wish to familiarise themselves with the state of family sociology in Europe.",Book,,,,0,"

Assessing inequalities in geographical access to emergency medical services in metropolitan Lisbon: a cross-sectional and ecological study,"['Katielle Silva', 'Miguel Padeiro']","Objectives Studies have suggested that material deprivation is strongly associated with negative health outcomes, and lower usage of various levels of healthcare. We aim to analyse geographical access to emergency medical services (EMSs) and hospital emergency units by EMS in relation to deprivation in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA), Portugal. Design This study estimates road network-based access times from the centroids of statistical sections (census block groups equivalent) to locations of EMS and hospital emergency services. Each statistical section has been linked to a Material Deprivation Index (MDI). A non-parametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) was undertaken to compare MDI-linked statistical sections in terms of access to emergency care. Geographical access analysis was conducted for 2018. Primary outcome measure Road network-based access time (in minutes) for EMSs to statistical sections and then on to emergency units in hospitals. Results Overall, 82.4% of the LMA population is located less than a 10 min drive from an EMS without transport, and 99.1% from an EMS with transport. Travel time from EMS with transport to hospital is potentially less than 20 min for 95.2% of the population. However, 63.1% of residents living beyond a 30 min threshold (total time from emergency call to hospital arrival) are in areas with very high MDI (18.8% in high MDI, 13.3% in medium MDI, 4.7% in low MDI, 0% in very low MDI). Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA confirms discrepancies in access times between better-off and poorer areas. Conclusion Poorer areas experience worse geographical access to EMS and hospital emergency units.

Payments for Ecosystem Services and Rural Transition to Sustainability. A critical assessment.,"['Rui Simões', 'Alexandra Bussler']","Ecosystem services (ES) are commonly understood as the benefits humankind obtains from nature in order to satisfy their needs and that, at the same time, fulfil other species requirements (Costanza et al., 1997; MEA, 2005). Designed with the aim to capture the value that nature should represent for society, the concept of ES has been gradually introduced into the realm of the market (Gómez-Baggethun et al., 2010). Nowadays, it is argued that Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) help to reverse the degradation of ecosystems, its services and biodiversity and even help to restore the latter. Furthermore, it is said to reduce poverty and create a novel “urban–rural compact” since it transfers funds from consumers of ES to the providers responsible for their provisions (Kosoy & Corbera, 2010, p. 1228). Heavy critiques have arisen of the utilitarian approach to nature, especially the mainstreaming of the economic approach to nature (cf. Gómez-Baggethun et al., 2010; McCaubley, 2006; Corbera et al., 2007). However, they are still seen as the dominant mechanism to attain sustainability. Some authors are even proposing that, if significantly altered and reframed, PES could help to trigger a transition to sustainability (Muniz & Cruz, 2015). It is in this realm that our paper has to be positioned. It has the double aim of 1) inquiring into how the PES mechanism functions, in order to 2) find out which are the main limitations and constraints of this approach to value ecosystems. For this undertaking we look at the hypothetical case of a rural unsustainable community in Southern Europe and ask ourselves under which premises the PES mechanism could help the community to transition to a real sustainability state, framed by the transition literature.

Narratives of Socioecological Transition: The Case of the Transition Network in Portugal,"['Vera Ferreira', 'Antonio Carvalho']","This article explores narratives and characteristics of sociological transitions displayed by members of the Transition Network (TN) in Portugal. It is informed by scholarly work on grassroots innovations, sociological transition narratives, and environmental engagement in Portugal. It furthers this research in three ways: (1) it analyzes an original case study—the Portuguese TN; (2) it identifies and defines the various socioecological narratives conveyed by its participants; and (3) it interprets the TN’s sociopolitical appeal as a grassroots innovation in the context of environmental mobilization in Portugal. Drawing on 20 semistructured interviews with current and former members of the Portuguese TN, three narratives of sociological transition were identified—utopianism, inevitability, and pessimism—as well as seven characteristics that motivated interviewees’ engagement with the TN.",Article,1 , Nature and Culture,Jun 11,0,"

The AMIGAS Model: Reconciling Prejudice Reduction and Collective Action Approaches Through a Multicultural Commitment in Intergroup Relations,"['Ana Urbiola', 'Craig McGarty', 'Rui Costa-Lopes']","Social psychology’s search for ways to address intergroup inequality has grappled with two approaches that have been considered incompatible: (a) the prejudice reduction approach, that argues that changing individual negative attitudes will undermine the basis for discrimination and lead to intergroup harmony; and (b) the collective action approach, that argues that social protest and activism can improve the position of disadvantaged groups. The problem is that efforts toward prejudice reduction may serve to suppress genuine efforts to change. We propose the Achieving Multicultural Integration of Groups Across Society (AMIGAS) model, in which a multicultural commitment is proposed as a driver of both improved intergroup evaluations and promotion of collective action for reduced inequality, especially in contexts where there are conditions for a respectful intercultural dialogue. The AMIGAS model is a theoretical advance in the field of intergroup relations and a basis for implementing effective egalitarian policies and practices.",Article,1 , Review of General Psychology,,0,"

Pluralising the European energy landscape: Collective renewable energy prosumers and the EU's clean energy vision,"['Lanka Horstink', 'Kiat Ng', 'Julia Wittmayer']","To fulfil the European Union's (EU) goal of providing 'Clean Energy for All Europeans', a transformative shift from centralised, fossil-fuel based systems to decentralised systems based on renewable energy sources (RES) is envisaged. Keen to lead the clean energy transition while embedding technological innovation and elements of justice and equitability into the envisioned 'Energy Union', EU Member States need their citizens on board as active participants. Prosumerism or self-consumption is an important part of this citizen involvement. While the new EU regulatory framework for energy now recognises civic-inspired prosumer initiatives such as energy communities, little is known about the full range and diversity of collective actors in renewable energy self-consumption as well as how they engage with the changing energy system. This paper presents an exploratory categorisation of the different collective social actors that produce and consume energy from renewable sources, referred to as 'collective RES prosumers', aiming to clarify their participation in the energy landscape. We find six categories with different engagement and needs, which we relate to the EU's current framing of collective energy actors. We recommend fine-tuning policies to the different actors to support a true-to-vision transposition of the recently completed Clean Energy Package (CEP).",Article,1 , Energy Policy,,1,"

A indústria do branqueamento em Lisboa: uma etnografia das práticas e produtos para o branqueamento da pele e seus riscos para a saúde dermatológica,"['Chiara Pussetti', 'Isabel Pires']","Resumo Por meio de um exercício de walking ethnography, pretendemos apresentar uma etnografia da oferta cosmética destinada à despigmentação da pele no coração de Lisboa, focando num fragmento da cidade que junta diferentes propostas e produtos estéticos: spas chineses, salões de beleza e cabeleireiros africanos, lojas do comércio dito “étnico” ligado a imigrantes e portugueses descendentes de populações asiáticas ou africanas. Definimos esse passeio como “caminho do branqueamento” - parafraseando ironicamente o título de um dos mais famosos livros de Michael Jackson, Paths towards a clearing (1989). Considerando o corpo como um projeto em construção, pretendemos mostrar que os imaginários e os desejos ligados ao consumo desses tratamentos, assim como os padrões de beleza veiculados pelo marketing dos produtos de clareamento da pele, refletem e reproduzem variáveis sociais de género, classe e raça. Queremos também evidenciar como a maior parte dos produtos branqueadores, vendidos no centro da cidade, são proibidos pela legislação europeia de regulamentação de cosméticos, devido às altas concentrações de substâncias tóxicas. Essas substâncias, que circulam livremente nas redes do comercio informal, podem ser muito prejudiciais para a saúde dos consumidores, comportando severos riscos dermatológicos.",Article,0 , Saude e Sociedade,Jan 21,0,"

STANDARD INDICATORS FOR SCIENCE SOCIAL APPROPRIATION PERSIST_EU ERASMUS+ PROJECT Lessons learned,"['Empar Vengut-Climent', 'Carolina Moreno Castro', 'Isabel Mendoza-Poudereux[...]', 'Nieves Verdejo']","This book is the result of a two-and-a-halfyear close collaboration between the seven partners of the Erasmus+ KA203 project “Knowledge, beliefs, perceptions about the science of European students (Persist_EU)”. One of the project’s main objectives was to develop a tool to evaluate European students’ initial knowledge when configuring their beliefs and perceptions about different science topics. Once the tool (platform) had been designed, the next step consisted of carrying out activities (Science camps), which would allow validating the platform and identifying changes in perception (through questionnaires with Likert scales), which students experienced during their participation in training activities, organised within the framework of the project. For this, five Science camps were organised in five European universities, two in central Europe (Germany, Slovakia), and three nations in southern Europe (Portugal, Spain and Italy). Therefore, we make sure to cover differences related to socio-geopolitical issues. The topics that were chosen for the debate were climate change, genetically-modified organisms (GMOs), complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) and vaccines, and it was expected that around 100 students would participate in each of the universities of the PERSIST_EU consortium (Valencia, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Trnava, Lisbon, and Vicenza).",Research,,,Mar 15,1,"

Tale of Two Cities: How Nature-Based Solutions Help Create Adaptive and Resilient Urban Water Management Practices in Singapore and Lisbon,"['Mengmeng Cui', 'Filipa Ferreira', 'Tze Kwan Fung', 'José Saldanha Matos']","Nature-based solutions (NbS) are increasingly recognized as viable tools for sustainable urban water management. This article explores the implementation of NbS in two distinct cities, Singapore and Lisbon, to demonstrate that NbS can work in very different contexts and spark new thoughts on the urban–nature relationship and to identify commonalities that drive and enable the implementation of NbS in different context. Literature review-based research was conducted to examine the types of NbS implemented, the common drivers, the governance model, and the plural functionalities of the solutions. The research shows that, despite the differences, the two cities shared common drivers (including water supply, flood control, and resident demand for green space) and goals, such as improving water quality and overall quality of life, through the deployment of NbS. With rapid urban expansion, water use increase, and the impacts of climate change, NbS can be effective tools to deliver integrated benefits and improve the liveability of cities.",Article,1 , Sustainability,,1,"

The “Souths” of the “Wests”. Southern critique and comparative housing studies in Southern Europe and USA,['Simone Tulumello'],"Southern urban critique has enriched our understanding of global uneven development, but often ended up constructing a dichotomous understanding of two apparently homogeneous fields: the Global North (or West) and South. This has been particularly evident in housing studies. In this article, I advocate for a relational, multi-scalar and comparative approach to southern urban critique, capable of exposing quasi-colonial relations within the urban “West”; and apply it to the exploration of housing dynamics and systems in Southern Europe and Southern USA—two regions linked to their continental “cores” by historical patterns of uneven and combined development. Despite being characterized by different urban frameworks and housing systems, these regions have in common analogous patterns of globalization and neoliberalization, with similar impacts over housing, especially in the aftermaths of the global economic crisis. By discussing how global trends intersect with regional contexts, I aim to provide conceptual and epistemological instruments for deepening the analytical grasp and political relevance of southern (urban) critique.",Article,1 , Housing Studies,,0,"

O impacto da evasão fiscal na performance orçamentária dos países,"['Felipe Nathan Ferreira dos Santos', 'Viviani Silva Lirio', 'Felippe Clemente']","Descrição: Resumo: A evasão fiscal constitui uma problemática de cunho socioeconômico que tem potencial para afetar de maneira direta e indireta a economia de um país, sobretudo pela dificuldade de se mensurar seu real valor, bem como pela impossibilidade de integração de seu devido enfrentamento por parte da sociedade. Entretanto, os debates e discussões acerca de tal problema têm sido realizados de maneira centrada em seus impactos microeconômicos, sendo os estudos dos seus efeitos e impactos macroeconômicos hodiernos e inclinados para a perquirição da arrecadação tributária. Assim, notando-se tal lacuna na literatura científica, que não tem abarcado importantes problemas de instabilidade econômica dos países, tal como o déficit orçamentário, o presente estudo visou identificar se a evasão fiscal pode ser considerada uma das causas dos distúrbios macroeconômicos dos países, validando e corroborando, dessa maneira, a discussão sobre a importância de sua mitigação. Por meio do uso de uma amostra de 158 países no período 1991-2015, o presente estudo buscou validar a hipótese de que maiores níveis de evasão fiscal implicam em maiores níveis de déficit orçamentário. Ademais, dado que a amostra coletada foi caracterizada por uma variedade de países que se discernem por diversos componentes socioeconômicos, os países foram estratificados em grupos de acordo com seus respectivos níveis de rendas e localizações hemisféricas. Para isso, foram criados dois modelos diferenciados pelo acréscimo dummies, e utilizadas as seguintes estratégias de estimação: MQO, Efeitos Fixos e Efeitos Aleatórios, dados em painel com termos de erro AR (1) e MMG-S.

As contingências, controvérsias e expectativas dirigidas à genética forense num contexto híbrido, em que se cruzam agendas securitárias dos Estados-Nação e práticas de cientistas, de agentes policiais e mensagens dos meios de comunicação social, são retratadas neste livro coletivo em jeito de diagnóstico das turbulências com que se confronta a ciência quando é convocada para fora do seu habitat tradicional. O ponto nevrálgico desta obra é a análise da dimensão pública da genética forense quando este domínio de saber científico, sob a égide da neutralidade, é convocado para produzir conhecimento que possa ser prático e útil na identificação criminal. No contexto de uma sociedade rendida à aura simbólica da genética e à vertente benéfica da ciência no contributo para a proteção e segurança da sociedade, esta obra assume a função de desconstruir a dimensão distópica da ciência associada a processos de vigilância estatal e policial, que ameaçam liberdades civis e sujeitam populações vulneráveis a processos insidiosos de racismo, discriminação e estigmatização.",Book,,,,0,"

The critical role of trust in experiencing and coping with energy poverty: Evidence from across Europe,"['Katrin Grossmann', 'GeorgeJiglau', 'Ute Dubois[...]', 'Anaïs Varo']","Trust is a fundamental ingredient of prosperous democracies. In Europe, trust in existing elected democratic institutions is fading while authoritarian nationalist movements grow. Experiences of neglect, ignorance, and inferiority are one explanation for this. This paper explores the link between the experiences of households in a state of energy poverty and their trust in institutions and social networks. Using qualitative data from ten different European countries, we show that a lack of trust in both public and private institutions is widespread among energy-poor households. Our interviewees show distrust in various dimensions. In their contacts with institutions, they report experiences of powerlessness, bad and unfair treatment, and feelings of inferiority. While some interviewees do trust single individuals within institutions, others trust only their own social networks and some have no trust in anyone. We further show how trust in networks or (people in) institutions can strengthen the coping capacities of energy-poor households while a lack of trust even cuts people off from the support they could attain and thus deepens their state of energy poverty.",Article,,,,0,"

A abordagem metodológica adoptada fundamenta-se, por um lado, nas metodologias utilizadas recentemente para estudos semelhantes realizados noutros países da Europa e na forma como a paisagem tem vindo a ser considerada em vários documentos estratégicos ao nível europeu, e por outro lado na preocupação, por parte da equipa, de considerar a paisagem numa perspectiva holística, contemplando as suas várias componentes: ecológica, cultural, socio-económica e sensorial. Para definir as unidades de paisagem, ao cruzamento da cartografia relativa a variáveis seleccionadas juntam-se assim a análise da imagem de satélite e as observações de campo, mas também uma avaliação por peritagem do caracter e coerência da paisagem. O resultado é uma abordagem flexível, que combina uma análise objectiva com uma outra mais subjectiva, sendo a combinação das duas considerada fundamental pela equipa para a verdadeira apreensão da paisagem.

Practical and Ethical Dilemmas in Researching Sensitive Topics with Populations Considered Vulnerable,"['Ana Patrícia Hilário', 'Fábio Rafael Augusto']","This book seeks to support social science researchers who interact with vulnerability and/or sensitivity in the context of their research. Whilst there has been some important debate about the theoretical, methodological and ethical issues of conducting research on sensitive topics, and/or with vulnerable populations, the number of scholarly publications focused solely on these topics is limited and not up to date. The book intends to fill this gap by providing various research experiences, as well as the elements that characterize them. The articles selected for this book intend, first and foremost, to stimulate reflexivity amongst the use of the concepts of sensitive topics and vulnerable groups, and to provide tools that will allow researchers to improve their research practices The book integrates several articles that explore a wide range of dilemmas that, to a certain extent, might allow the reader to access the backstage of this type of research. The reader will find here a rich and fruitful space for theoretical and empirical reflection, where several social science researchers with different backgrounds share their experiences and research paths in a rigorous and creative way.",Book,,,,1,"

Data were collected in the frame of the SafeConsume project by multidisciplinary research teams that visited consumers during preparing a meal and had the possibility to examine their cooking routines. Distances between sink and stove, sink and refrigerator, stove and refrigerator, sink and working place (countertop or table), stove and working place were analysed to correlate food safety practices applied during cooking with kitchen arrangements. The results arising from analysing the ergonomics of kitchens versus potential cross-contamination events are presented in Mihalache et al., [1]. These data contribute to a better understanding of real kitchen layouts and can be used as a starting point for future research regarding food safety-oriented arrangements instead of ergonomics-focused designs, for food safety risk assessments, as study cases for explaining specific measures that can be established to improve food handling and hygiene practices in homes and for sociological research pointing consumers’ behaviour during cooking.",Article,1 , Data in Brief,,0,"

Technocratic attitudes and voting behaviour ten years after the Eurozone crisis: Evidence from the 2019 EP elections,"['Lea Heyne', 'Marina Costa Lobo']","The onset of the Great Recession raised the profile of technocracy, or government by experts, as a contrasting model to democracy. Yet, there is little research on how attitudes towards technocracy may impact European citizens' political behaviour. Moreover, the consistency of technocracy supporters' political attitudes, especially towards the EU, is questionable. This paper uses new survey panel data collected before and after the European parliament elections in May 2019 in six countries (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain). We investigate how citizens’ technocratic attitudes affect their voting behaviour in the European elections. We find evidence that citizens with technocratic attitudes are less likely to support mainstream parties, and tend to either abstain or, if they vote, to give their vote to anti-system parties, especially from the populist right. In addition, by distinguishing technocracy supporters according to their partisanship, we conclude that technocracy is a thin ideology that can be combined with different patterns of political support: while many technocracy supporters have no party identification or support non-mainstream parties and show dissatisfaction with democracy and the EU, another subgroup of technocracy supporters identifies with a mainstream political party and show above average political support and support for the EU.",Article,1 , Electoral Studies,Apr 19,1,"

Feeding the family at the end‐of‐life: An ethnographic study on the role of food and eating practices for families facing death in Portugal,"['Ana Patrícia Hilário', 'Fábio Rafael Augusto']","Little has been said about the disruptive impact that the inability to eat and to participate in mealtimes has for patients with a life‐threatening illness and their families. The aim of the current study is to overcome this gap and shed light on how food and eating practices are experienced by families at the end‐of‐life. An ethnographic research was developed in two Portuguese palliative care units: participant observation was conducted during 10 months and in‐depth interviews were carried out with 10 patients with a life‐threatening illness, 20 family members and 20 palliative care professionals. Food is not only a matter of nutrition in a biological sense, but also an act of giving care to patients with a life‐threatening illness. The findings suggest that food and eating practices affect the processes of relationality and of doing family at the end‐of‐life in Portugal. Attention is particularly paid to gender differences. The study supports recent sociological research which understands the dying process as a relational experience and intends to develop sociological knowledge on the materialities of care.",Article,1 , Health & Social Care in the Community,Mar 13,0,"

Development of social values in childhood and early adolescence: a systematic review,"['Evelia Alvarez', 'Iva Tendais', 'Alice Ramos[...]', 'Isabel Correia']","Values are a central dimension of human social life. As conceptualized in Schwartz’s Theory of Basic Human Values, they are core to a person’s self-concept and drive individual actions towards both personal development and social transformation. Cross-cultural research with adults reveals a consensus regarding values’ structure and priorities. Research with young populations is still very recent, but has already provided relevant theoretical and empirical insights. In this systematic review, we have aimed to collect and analyse studies on the development of basic human values in childhood and early adolescence that published from 2008 to 2021. A systematic search of the literature was undertaken using three electronic databases (PsycINFO, Web of Science and Scopus). Reviewers independently conducted the screening procedures to identify all papers focusing on basic human values in childhood and early adolescence (5 to 14 years-old), according to a set of previously defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The articles were submitted to a standardised quality appraisal assessment tool to determine their methodological soundness. The retrieved data was extracted and summarised using a narrative synthesis approach that reports studies’ characteristics, socio-demographic variables, evidence on value structure, value preferences, factors associated with values and measures used to assess values in children and adolescents. A total of 44 papers were included in this review. The evidence provides extensive support to Schwartz's theoretical model. Moreover, several factors concerning predictors, moderators, mediators, correlates and outcomes of values were identified, and a total of 6 different instruments that allow measuring valu

Food assistance in Portugal: organizational challenges in three different contexts,['Fábio Rafael Augusto'],"Purpose: Drawing on an ethnographic research study, developed in three different food assistance initiatives (FAIs) operating in Portugal, this article seeks to explore the elements that characterize them and the main organizational challenges they face. Design/methodology/approach: Participant observation was carried out in a surplus food redistribution charity, a soup kitchen and a social supermarket, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with supervisors of these FAIs. The study followed an inductive coding strategy, and a thematic analysis was developed. Findings: The main results point to an appreciation of the initiatives and the role they play, but they also highlight the existence of several challenges, mainly related to: 1) difficulties in accessing sources of funding, 2) the absence of an intervening state and 3) a scarcity of resources that allow a thorough assessment of their activities and services provided, which weakens the public image of these responses. Originality/value: The development of food assistance in Europe has a long history. Over the past few years, this sector has grown significantly. Nowadays, it is possible to identify several realities around emergency food provision. However, this heterogeneity has not been sufficiently explored in the literature. In addition, there are few studies that report on the variety of initiatives that coexist in Portugal and establish a comparison between them. The current paper intends to overcome this gap by seeking to understand the main models of food assistance operating in the country.",Article,1 , Journal of Organizational Ethnography,May 6,0,"

Learning from COVID-19: a systems approach for public health governance,"['Jieling Liu', 'Yurong Wu', 'Cunrui Huang']","The COVID-19 rapidly evolved into a global pandemic. Countries have taken measures widely to prevent and control the epidemic. China for example, has control the spread effectively, while many countries are still striving to cope with the increasing COVID-19 confirmed cases. The epidemic revealed serious problems of public health governance in many countries with long lasting social and economic consequences. This commentary reviews the pandemic response measures in five selected countries: China, Italy, the United States, Brazil and India. Building on critical reflections on the problems incurred in each country's pandemic responses, we provide a theoretical framework to reconceptualize public health as multiple types of economic goods. We further couple this reconceptualization with a systems approach to public health and wellbeing to offer new thinking on health governance. Finally, we propose suggestions for better, preventative and comprehensive epidemic prevention and health governance in an increasing urban future.",Preprint,,,Mar 3,1,"

Title: Charity & Grace,['Joao Pina-Cabral'],"This essay attempts to reconcile charity with grace, the central concepts of two thinkers whose views may seem irreconcilable to many: Donald Davidson, an analytical philosopher and the most distinguished follower of Quine; and Julian Pitt-Rivers, a Europeanist anthropologist, who wrote at length on Spain and Southern France. The latter's historicist exegesis of gracia points to basic aspects of human experience that are also salient in the reduction to basics that Davidson carried out concerning interpretation and truth. For Davidson, in the face of ultimate indeterminacy, interpretation is made possible due to the rational accommodation that charity sparks off. For Pitt-Rivers, gratuity highlights how processes of personal interaction depend on the drawing of shared trajectories: that is, not only do I have to grant others charity in order to make sense of them, I also have to frame others as subjects with a future by relation to myself as already in existence. The paper proposes that human interaction involves processes of sense-making that integrate shared intentionality (i.e. the credit with which we respond to the indeterminacy of meaning) with",Preprint,,,,0,"

Smart Specialisation Strategies and Regional Convergence: Spanish Extremadura after a Period of Divergence,"['Paulo Miguel Madeira', 'Mário Vale', 'Julián Mora-Aliseda']","Smart specialization strategies are a new EU approach to cohesion policy, meant to deliver growth and development at EU national and regional level. Bearing in mind its focus on place-based development strategies, this paper intends to shed some light on its appropriateness to tackle uneven development and regional growth divergence. The paper showcases Spanish Extremadura growth trajectory. Extremadura is a poor region in the European context that between 2008 and 2014 diverged from the EU average, despite being eligible for EU funding as a convergence region by cohesion policy. In the 2014–2020 programming period, there was a positive dynamic at the beginning, but from 2017 onwards convergence stopped, which indicates that thematic and regional programmes have not delivered results or have not compensated for higher growth level of other Spanish regions. Moreover, research and innovation strategies for smart specialization (RIS3) seem to have limited impacts on place-based economic transformation in less developed regions. From this example, the suitability of the smart specialisation strategy as the core of cohesion policy in the programming period is discussed. It concludes that this strategy is interesting for intermediate development regions with some industrial base but does not seem appropriate as a convergence driver for poorer regions.",Article,1 , Economies,Sep 29,1,"

Self-reported practices by Portuguese consumers regarding eggs’ safety: An analysis based on critical consumer handling points,"['Luis Junqueira', 'Monica Truninger', 'Valérie Lengard Almli[...]', 'Paula Teixeira']","In Europe, salmonellosis has been ranked as the second leading cause of hospitalization and death due to the consumption of contaminated food. Information about consumers’ food safety perception, knowledge and practices in the domestic environment is lacking in order to define the main intervention opportunities to obtain a significant reduction in the occurrence of foodborne salmonellosis. We conducted an on-line survey of the Portuguese population on self-reported domestic egg handling and occurrence of illness from egg consumption, which were analysed in a Critical Consumer Handling (CCH) framework. Respondents (N = 927) reported behaviours associated with high risk of Salmonella infection, namely the frequent consumption of eggs from non-controlled sources (43%) and of dishes prepared with uncooked or lightly cooked eggs. Other risk related practices, from egg storage until consumption, were also found to be common. However, when buying eggs respondents value safety-related criteria above others – use-by date (highly valued by 72.8%), lack of cracks (72.2%) and cleanliness (48%). Association of eggs with Salmonella contamination was recognized by 65.8% of the respondents; 72.2% declared to have never been sick after eating eggs. In addition to global egg safety awareness messages, future campaigns should prioritize shifting consumers towards eggs with low probability of being contaminated and encouraging the use of pasteurized eggs, in particular when used in recipes that are not fully heat treated. The importance of storing backyards eggs at refrigeration temperature needs to be communicated.",Article,1 , Food Control,Oct 29,0,"

AN INVESTIGATION INTO STRATEGIES FOR THE MEANING MAKING WITH ARTWORKS,"['João Pedro Fróis', 'Carolina Silva']","What takes place when we undergo what is referred to as aesthetic experience? What is the educational value of such experience? How does aesthetic experience prompt meaning making? Our presentation addresses these questions. The presentation consists of two parts. Our particular interest rests in the relation between aesthetic experience and its capacity for meaning making. Thus in the first part we address some current literature linked to our focus. This discussion provides a theoretical framework for the second part. One challenge to aesthetic education is to be able to demonstrate that, within encounters with artworks, some form of learning is taking place. We maintain that the amassing of historical or technical information is not the primary benefit of aesthetic encounters. What then is the particular nature of aesthetic learning? Some research suggests that aesthetic encounters complement and help articulate earlier experiences. This counts as learning because it provides us with greater understanding of that to which we have been previously introduced. In the second part of our presentation we present examples of just such learning. Other research suggests that, because aesthetic encounters require a reciprocal interaction between viewer and the object or event experienced, the interaction is a form of dialogue in which one comes to empathize with the other while at the same time gaining increased self-understanding. Our study also supports this thesis. In the second part of our presentation we provide examples of how such learning takes place. Our examples derive from an ongoing research project involving 24 Portuguese subjects (artists and non artists) in a meaning making process with artw

Postscript: The Intellectual Origins of European Integration,"['James Ashley Morrison', 'José LuÍs Cardoso']","This chapter draws on the previous contributions in this volume to consider the intellectual origins of European integration. First, it analyses the many changes in, and responses to, the operation of “the state” wrought by the First World War and the calamities that followed. In this period, the classic questions surrounding the relationship between law, order and liberty took on new meaning and inspired new ideas. Some of the more ambitious—even radical—figures suggested rewriting entirely the so-called “rules of the game.” Others sought to re-establish the old order on a more philosophically robust and practically pragmatic footing. These new ideas both followed from, and fostered, new approaches, methods and academic collaborations across the traditional disciplinary, cultural and national borders. For many, these dynamics brought a heightened urgency and a new sense of possibility to the age-old dreams of a united Europe. The chapter closes by reflecting on the work undertaken—and the work left unfinished—by the architects of the post-war European project.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Within and Against Racial Segregation: Notes from Italy’s Encampment Archipelago,['Irene Peano'],"The pandemic brought migrant farm workers into the limelight once again, as has happened repeatedly in the last three decades, in Italy as in many other parts of the world. Here I examine how intersecting and sometimes conflicting discourses and interventions, that have this biopolitically conceived population as their object, decide upon these subjects’ worthiness of attention, care, and sympathy through criminalizing, victimizing, and humanitarian registers. I reflect on some of the affective dynamics that sustain both the governmental operations through which these populations were (sought to be) managed and reactions against them from a situated perspective, as an accomplice to many of the forms of struggle in which migrant farm workers have engaged in the last decade in Italy. The stage for many such occurrences is what I have elsewhere defined as the “encampment archipelago” that many such workers, and particularly those who migrate from across West Africa, inhabit—labor or asylum-seeker camps, but also slums or isolated, derelict buildings, and various hybrid, in-between spaces among which people circulate.",Article,1 , Lateral,,0,"

Parliamentary Mandate Fulfilment. An automated approach to measuring congruence between the pre and post-electoral discourse of parties using word embeddings,['Yani Kartalis'],"The idea that electoral competition, party promises and manifestos are important for how the representative behaviour of parties unfolds post-electorally is central to democratic theories of representation. Scholars of Party Mandate fulfilment have for long been focusing methodologically on the number of pre-electoral pledges parties in government manage to realize. This paper analyses existing research and its limitations and proposes a novel approach for mandate fulfilment, extending past research (both conceptually and methodologically) by looking at the extent to which the parliamentary discourse of parties matches their electoral discourse. It designs, tentatively validates and implements a novel measure of how similar is the pre and post-electoral rhetoric of parties by utilizing recent advances in computational linguistics and the diffusion of text analysis tools in the social sciences. It applies it on the Irish parliament and compares electoral manifesto data with post-electoral parliamentary data from 1997 to 2019.",Preprint,,,Apr 18,0,"

Effective Government and Evaluations of Democracy,"['Christopher Claassen', 'Pedro C. Magalhães']","Ineffective governance is known to weaken support for governments and leaders. However, it is less clear whether these effects spill over to the regime and erode support for the democratic system. This article returns to this classic question, now using time-series, cross-sectional data to test whether the effectiveness of governments in sustaining economic growth, providing quality healthcare, and tackling violent crime affects popular attitudes to democracy. We find that satisfaction with democracy is driven by fluctuations in economic performance and violent crime (but not healthcare quality). Diffuse support for democracy, in contrast, remains relatively impervious to changes in government effectiveness. Violent crime is the only indicator of effectiveness which has an impact on democratic support, and does so indirectly, via its influence on democratic satisfaction. These findings confirm that democratic support—which, unlike democratic satisfaction, is thought to help sustain democracy—is mostly immune to crises of performance.",Article,1 , Comparative Political Studies,Sep 28,1,"

Enabling the City: Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary encounters in research and practice,"['Josefine Fokdal', 'Olivia Bina', 'Prue Chiles[...]', 'Katrin Paadam']","About the book Enabling the City is a collaborative book that focuses on how interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary processes of knowledge production may contribute to urban transformation at a local level in the 21st Century. It is designed to respond to the growing appeal for transformative change, by exploring the often inconvenient and uncomfortable spaces of knowledge production and co-creation that can make such change happen. Combining global trends in theory with experience of local practice, Enabling the City strikes a balance between enthusiastic support for such transformational potential and a cautious note regarding the persistent challenges to the ethos as well as the practice of inter and transdisciplinarity. The rich stories reflect different research and local practice cultures, exploring issues such as wellbeing and ageing, community, health and dementia, public space, energy, mobility cultures, heritage, housing, re-use, and renewal, as well as more universal questions about urban sustainability and climate change, and perhaps most importantly, education and competences. Against this backdrop, aspirations for the 21st century are related to the international, national, and local agendas expressed in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and in the New Urban Agenda (NUA), raising fundamental questions of how to enable development. The reflexive approach that runs through the book aims to respond to international, national and local agendas, offering new forms of understanding collaborative process and ways of knowing that are essential in urban research and practice. Enabling the City translates the lessons learned from these studies into a comprehensive framework of four phas

The quality of local democracy: an institutional analysis,"['Luis de Sousa', 'Nuno Ferreira da Cruz', 'Daniel Fernandes']","Much of the literature on quality of democracy is case study-oriented and focused on nation states. Theoretical work and, in particular, comparative empirical research on the quality of local democracy are less advanced. This paper contributes to our understanding of how democracy works from below. It develops a conceptual framing and employs a multidimensional index of the quality of democracy across all 278 municipalities in mainland Portugal by focusing on procedural dimensions of democratic performance at three levels of legitimacy: input, throughput, and output. Regression analysis is then used as a preliminary test of the usefulness of these measures of quality of local democracy and to uncover associations between them and a range of political and socioeconomic factors. The results suggest that municipalities led by independent mayors, with larger populations and higher levels of multiculturalism are likelier to be associated with ‘better’ local democracy.",Article,1 , Local Government Studies,Feb 22,0,"

An Experimental Examination of Attentional Bias in Medical Care During the Covid-19 Pandemic,"['Filipa Madeira', 'Alexandre Vieira', 'Cicero Roberto Pereira', 'Emerson Do Bú']","In many countries, the incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates of the covid-19 virus have disproportionately affected non-white people, but there is a lack of published data explaining this phenomenon. Are admissions to intensive care units proportional among white and black people? Are physicians more likely to, unknowingly, pay more attention to white patients and therefore be more likely to offer them life-saving intensive care treatment? This study examined whether white Portuguese medical students' reaction to patients is affected by patients' race in a scenario of limited medical resources. Using an experimental paradigm, the authors asked whether exposure to objects associated with intensive care (vs. neutral objects) increased the attention of white medical students, and whether such attention to intensive care stimuli increased when preceded by white faces (vs. black faces). The results show that medical students' attention was significantly higher toward intensive care stimuli (vs. neutral stimuli), but that there wasn't a statistically significant difference in their attention to intensive care stimuli when they were primed with a white face vs. a black face. The paradigm was successful in capturing selective attention in a novel context-the covid-19 pandemic-suggesting that it can be used in future studies as a tool for examining attentional processes in medical research.",Article,,,Nov 22,1,"

POWER RELATIONSHIPS IN GRETA THUNBERG'S SPEECH ABOUT WORLD CLIMATE CHANGE,"['Priscilla Silva', 'Palloma da Costa e Silva', 'Ricardo Luiz Perez Teixeira']","A Climate change is a global environmental threat. The economic, social and environmental consequences have been discussed by climate organizations and activists. The emergence of political changes linked to environmental issues has fueled protests around the world because there are many discussions and few concrete results. The aim of this study is to analyze linguistically-discursively the power relations in the speech of environmental activist Greta Thunberg and what Sociology of the Environment has discussed regarding the participation of society in environmental protection policies. The climate change activist's speeches are selected from the internet. Discourse analysis is used under the theory of Perelman (2005) considering argumentation as a form of persuasion and Foucault (1999) about discourse and power. The analysis by Dunlap (2015) and Okereke (2018) follows, following the stream of Chateauraunaud's pragmatic sociology (2005). The results show that there is a prevalence of a persuasive discourse aimed at the climate crisis, in an attempt to highlight the emergencies and the strength of the new generation for political movements. It is concluded that public policies are guided by concrete actions based on social movements, not only in terms of social movements based on environmental awareness, but also on the demands of the next generation and forms of power through discourse.",Article,1 , International Journal of Development Research,,0,"

The European Union and political behaviour: The shadow of the Great Recession,"['Marina Costa Lobo', 'Michael Lewis-Beck']","The symposium aims to analyse the politicisation of the European issue following the onset of the Eurozone crisis, in particular its impact on individual attitudes and voting both at the national and supranational level. By way of an introduction, we address the state of the art on the importance of the Eurozone crisis for EU politicisation, as well as outlining each article and its contribution. While our authors may sometimes focus on different dependent variables, they all speak to the question of whether the Great Recession made a lasting difference, and whether EU politicisation matters. Most articles are longitudinal, and test for changes due to the crisis (Dassonneville, Lewis- Beck and Jabbour; Ruiz-Rufino; Talving and Vasilopolou; Jurado and Navarrete). But preoccupation with the Great Recession is also present in the articles assessing the political learning that unfolded from it (Ruiz-Rufino), or the ones which investigate whether EU effects can be detected during the post-crisis years (Talving and Vasilopolou; Lobo and Pannico; Heyne and Lobo). Despite the diversity of approaches, and certain differences in findings, each article contributes to a major debate ongoing in the literature, especially three key debates which have arisen: the crisis’ impact on European party systems, economic voting, and the degree of legitimacy of democratic systems.",Article,1 , Electoral Studies,Jan 27,0,"

Agonistic security: Transcending (de/re)constructive divides in critical security studies,['Simone Tulumello'],"This article is a contribution to transcending the dichotomy between deconstruction and reconstruction in critical security studies. In the first part, I review dominant (Western/liberal) logics of security and the main strands of critical security studies to argue for the need to: overcome the liberal framework of the balance among rights and freedom, with its inherent imbrication with the fantasy of absolute security; and, contra the ultimate conclusions of deconstructive critique, to take the desire for security seriously at the same time. By advocating for embracing the tensions that surface at this intersection, I then move to my reconstructive endeavor. I set out a meta-theory with both analytical and normative nature, agonistic security, inspired by the political theory developed by Mouffe and Laclau. Building on the opposition between antagonism and agonism, I argue that security belongs to the “political”, and that it constitutes a field of struggle for politicization. I then argue for three conceptual shifts, which concretely define agonistic security: i) from an absolute/static to a relational/dynamic understanding of security; ii) from universalism to pluralism at a world scale; and iii) from the dominance of individual rights in Western/liberal thinking toward security as a collective endeavor. In conclusion, I take a step back and discuss the implications of agonistic security for the role of critique in security studies.",Article,0 , Security Dialogue,Aug 9,0,"

Homeland as a multi-scalar community: (Dis)continuities in the US security/safety discourse and practice,"['Simone Tulumello', 'Roberto Falanga']","This article takes steps from the birth and consolidation of “homeland” as the central discursive engine of the US national security enterprise; and takes issue with the dominant scholarly interpretation of the geographical and spatial implications of its emergence in terms of the dissolution of space and spatialization in security policy ( Bialasiewicz et al., 2007 : 416). We adopt a multi-scalar approach to exploring security discourse/practice, comparing the performativity of national and global security with the local practice/discourse of public safety—with empirical focus on the case of Memphis (TN). Our main arguments are that the homeland builds on the same performative elements of the emergence and consolidation of a certain conception of “community”, as it has become dominant in public safety policymaking at the local scale; and that the homeland/community performativity is the expression of a never-ending movement of production of multi-scalar geographies of the “good” and “evil”, made of the coexistence of centrifugal (pushing problems away) and centripetal (incorporating any given outside) dimensions.",Article,1 , Environment and Planning C Politics and Space,,0,"

Rural NEETs in Portugal: 2009/2019 overview,"['Francisco Simões', 'Tatiana Ferreira', 'Maria Manuel Vieira']","Executive summary This report outlines in detail the situation of rural youths Neither in Employment, nor in Education or Training (NEET) aged between 15 and 34 years old, over the last decade (2009- 2019) in Portugal. To do this, the report portrays indicators of: youth population; youth em- ployment and unemployment; education; and, NEETs distribution. The characterisation of all indicators adopts the degree of urbanisation as a central criterion, thereby enabling propor- tional comparisons between rural areas, towns and suburbs, cities and the whole country. These analyses are further divided into age subgroups and, where possible, into sex groups for greater detail. The statistical procedures adopted across the different selected dimensions involve: des- criptive longitudinal analysis; using graphical displays (e.g., overlay line charts); and, the calculation of proportional absolute and relative changes between 2009 and 2013, 2013 and 2019, and finally 2009 and 2019. These time ranges were chosen to capture the in- dicators evolution before and after the economic crisis which hit European countries. All data was extracted from Eurostat public datasets. The analyses show that between 2009 and 2019 the rural youth population aged 15 to 24 years has been increasing in Portugal. Although the youth unemployment rate is higher in cities, rural areas faced more difficulties in overcoming the effects of the crisis, particularly among young adults aged over 25 years. In the field of education, however, there was an absolute and relative reduction in the proportion of young people with lower qualifications compared with young people in early school leavers in rural areas between 2009-2019, even though it still remains well above the 10% targe

Specters of Eurafrica in an Italian Agroindustrial Enclave,['Irene Peano'],"The plain of Tavoliere, which makes up the largest portion of the district of Foggia, in the upper part of Italy’s southeastern Apulian region, today still bears the traces of a fascist infrastructural project of land reclamation that originally took shape in the 1920s and 1930s. Here, Mussolini’s regime had devised its largest feat of bonifica integrale (“integral cleansing,” or “reclamation”). Fascism’s overall project spanned various areas of “metropolitan” Italy and its overseas territories in Libya and East Africa, and aimed to fulfill the promise of land to peasants—a core element of fascism’s political platform in the aftermath of World War I—without upsetting that landowning elite which had supported the dictatorship’s rise to power. At the same time, these measures worked to quell internal opposition and build international reputation. While the scheme became progressively innervated by partially new ideals of racial purity and unity, it built on previous experiments dating as far back as the late eighteenth century, and would outlive the downfall and formal repudiation of the fascist credo at the end of World War II. The spectral survivals of these interventions on land, property, and people, which have stratified the landscape over the course of more than two centuries, haunt agribusiness enclaves and their migrant workforce today.",Article,,,,0,"

"Book Review - SHEA BUTTER REPUBLIC: State Power, Global Markets and the making of an Indigenous Commodity",['Kishor Subba Limbu'],"The ""Shea butter"" (known in Francophone countries as KARITE) extraction process is very long and time-consuming; in the rainy season, females collect the Shea fruit; generally, they prefer to order fruit from the ground because they know that the fallen fruits are mature and rich intake of the oil on the seed. They dry the fruits in the sunlight, remove the husk, remove the shell with a stone or wooden mallet, and sort the seeds. They remove the terrible roots and dry them in the sunlight. Drying is always challenging because of the uncertain rain. If the seed is wet by the rain, the drying back, and the more important thing is the rain will damage the seeds' quality. The seed has to crush into flour, then it has to roast, and the roasted flour has to fine grind. The fine powder of the Shea has to put into a big vessel. When water adds, women marinate it correctly. It is the job of power. They are adding water slowly to the paste. Oily particles come on the top of the water as the raw butter. Females take it out handful by handful in another vessel, and then they boil the natural butter; liquid has to filter and pour into the put then let it be for the setting. When it becomes golden in colour, that would be the Shea butter, which can store year and years long.",Article,,,,0,"

Interweaving Knowledge Systems Through Sustainability Governance,"['Joao Morais Mourato', 'Alexandra Bussler', 'Fronika de Wit']","The year 2020 will go down in history as the global breakout year of the Covid-19 virus. With its devastating impacts yet to be fully determined, the pandemic’s anthropogenic origins, reach, public, and political response are a stark reminder of the challenges the implementation of the UN Agenda 2030 and its 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) will face. At first, the urgency and immediacy of the Covid-19 crisis may fog this comparison. However, a striking resemblance becomes apparent when taking into account the pandemic’s global nature, associated geopolitical strife, scrambled initial institutional action, dynamic of (mis)information flows, and uneven geographical and socioeconomic implications. Concerning knowledge, a clear dichotomy emerged during Covid-19. On the one hand, a collaborative race for solutions began in terms of treatment, containment, and prevention. From epidemiologists, physicians to social psychologists, from local nurses to the World Health Organization, from national heads of state to mayors and civil society, Covid-19 mobilized joint working at different levels, sectors, and between a widely diverse array of actors. On the other hand, it also illustrated the speed in which fake facts spread in the age of post-truth. This highlighted the dangers of knowledge politicization, with its use primarily tuned for political combat rather than socially beneficial purposes. Multiple lessons can be taken from the outset of the pandemic to inform the implementation of the UN Agenda 2030 and the SDGs: the need to reorganize political priorities in face of a perceived emergency and to work collaboratively at multiple levels, as well as the relevance of an adequate knowledge governance framework.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Title: Company and the mysteries of a dugout canoe,['Joao Pina-Cabral'],"Abstract: This paper examines the mysterious side of ‘company,’ a fundamental aspect of human existence, exemplifying it with an ethnographic case about a dugout canoe in the mangroves of southern Bahia (NE Brazil). Being in company involves an intersubjective engagement that has implications not only for what we do, but also for who we are, and where we are. Company involves more than simply one person interacting with another; it necessarily engages more than two persons inhabiting a common space. As persons emerge into personhood always within company, they necessarily experience the presence of third parties as a possible threat, inevitably giving rise to contradictory emotions. That is why company moves us emotionally and transcendentally, why it produces mysterious effects.

Visual Representations of Science in a Pandemic: COVID-19 in Images,"['Ana Delicado', 'Jussara Rowland']","This article aims to contribute to the understanding of the social dimensions of the 2020 pandemic, with a particular emphasis on the visual practices of science communication in times of health emergency, by analyzing how the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is being visually represented. It seeks to identify the format and content of images used to illustrate online information about the pandemic, in particular, from websites of policy institutions, research promoters, and media in Portugal and Spain. By examining a sample containing 600 images, it aims to identify the messages being conveyed and the effects these images intend to provoke and to illuminate the differences in representations among the three sources of communication. Differences and similarities with visual images of previous pandemics (influenza, AIDS) are examined. This article ascertains that policy websites aim to be mostly prescriptive, relying on infographics to convey prevention and care instructions to its audiences. On the other hand, science websites rely mostly on stock photos and images from scientific articles to illustrate current research, while newspaper websites are the most diversified in terms of the images they use and the topics they cover. This study concludes that representations of science are still very much based on stereotypical imagery of labs and white coats, that representations of the medical side of the pandemic are focused on images of intensive care that aim to generate fear and stimulate responsible behavior, and that the social aspects of the pandemic are illustrated by images that focus either on pandemic prevention (e.g., washing hands) or on the impacts of the pandemic itself (e.g., empty streets during lockdown).",Article,1 , Frontiers in Communication,May 7,1,"

Green(er) Cities and Their Citizens: Insights from the Participatory Budget of Lisbon,"['Roberto Falanga', 'Jessica Verheij', 'Olivia Bina']","There is rising scholarly and political interest in participatory budgets and their potential to advance urban sustainability. This article aims to contribute to this field of study through the specific lens of the city of Lisbon’s experience as an internationally acknowledged leader in participatory budgeting. To this end, the article critically examines the lessons and potential contribution of the Lisbon Participatory Budget through a multimethod approach. Emerging trends and variations of citizen proposals, projects, votes, and public funding are analysed in tandem with emerging key topics that show links and trade-offs between locally embedded participation and the international discourse on urban sustainability. Our analysis reveals three interconnected findings: first, the achievements of the Lisbon Participatory Budget show the potential to counteract the dominant engineered approach to urban sustainability; second, trends and variations of the achievements depend on both citizens’ voice and the significant influence of the city council through policymaking; and, third, the shift towards a thematic Green Participatory Budget in 2020 was not driven by consolidated social and political awareness on the achievements, suggesting that more could be achieved through the 2021 urban sustainability oriented Participatory Budget. We conclude recommending that this kind of analysis should be systematically carried out and disseminated within city council departments, promoting much needed internal awareness of PBs’ potential as drivers of urban sustainability. We also identify further research needed into the sustainability potential of green PBs.",Article,1 , Sustainability,Jul 23,1,"

Because You’re Worth It! The Medicalization and Moralization of Aesthetics in Aging Women,['Chiara Pussetti'],"In this article—based on the fieldwork I conducted in Lisbon (Portugal) between 2018 and 2021, employing in-depth ethnography and self-ethnography—I describe the experience of the medicalization and moralization of beauty in Portuguese women aged 45–65 years. I examine the ways in which practitioners inscribe their expert knowledge on their patients’ bodies, stigmatizing the marks of time and proposing medical treatments and surgeries to “repair” and “correct” them. Beauty and youth are symbolically constructed in medical discourse as visual markers of health, an adequate lifestyle, a strong character and good personal choices (such as not smoking, and a healthy diet and exercise habits). What beauty means within the discourse of anti-aging and therapeutic rejuvenation is increasingly connected to an ideal gender performance of normative, white, middle-class, heterosexual femininity that dismisses structural determinants. The fantasy of eternal youth, linked to a neoliberal ideology of limitless enhancement and individual responsibility, is firmly entrenched in moralizing definitions of aesthetics and gender norms. Finally, my article highlights the ways in which the women I interviewed do not always passively accept the discourse of the devaluation of the ageing body, defining femininity and ageing in their own terms by creating personal variants of the hegemonic normative discourses on beauty and successful ageing.",Article,1 , Societies,,0,"

Economic History and History of Economics: Complementary Approaches to Portuguese Economic Development,['José LuÍs Cardoso'],"This chapter focuses on how the problems of economic development were addressed by the Portuguese historiography of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The ensuing discussion benefits from the simultaneous consideration of two historiographical domains that complement each other: economic history and the history of economics. On the one hand, there are the authors and texts of economic history that seek to describe the facts and circumstances related to the functioning and dynamics of economic reality, for a given period or succession of periods, in order to establish evolutionary trends. On the other hand, there are the authors and texts of the history of economics that seek to adopt analytical forms (principles and laws) and doctrinal and programmatic frameworks (visions and ideologies) aimed at providing explanatory meaning to the observed economic changes, phenomena and regularities. A true understanding of the important issues pertaining to Portuguese economic development is to be found, however, in the intersection of these distinct but complementary historiographical perspectives.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Key Concepts and Terminology,['Mengmeng Cui'],"Many of us have heard the phrases “circular economy” and “linear economy”. The notion of “circular economy” has been around for at least a few decades, starting with the “open economy” versus “closed economy” articulated by Kenneth Boulding in 1966 in his essay “The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth” (To download the essay, please go to: http://www.ub.edu/prometheus21/articulos/obsprometheus/BOULDING.pdf.). Since then, the concepts of feedback systems, cradle-to-cradle, closed-loop and many more essentially circular economy equivalent concepts have flourished and further developed into different branches in resource management, environmental policy, sustainable development and other subjects we are familiar with today from many university curriculums. It is, however, only in recent years, that the circular economy concept as an all-encompassing concept of future economic development model, gained global and cross-sector traction.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Strategie di comunità nel turismo mediterraneo,"['Marc Boyer', 'Margherita Ciacci', 'Egeria Di Nallo[...]', 'Liliane Voyer']","Il Mediterraneo è da sempre un'area di incontri, di sfide, e di temporanei nascondimenti. È un'area di confronti economici, sociali e culturali, facilitati dalla rapidità delle comunicazioni offerta dal mare, tra aree e comunità che il mare stesso e la varietà ambientale delle terre che lo circondano contribuiscono a mantenere separate. Ambiente, storia, cultura fanno di ogni comunità dell'area mediterranea un soggetto specifico, consapevole però della sua appartenenza ad un'area unica - qualificata proprio dalla compresenza e dalla comunicazione tra diverse specificità - e dell'appartenenza, per suo tramite, alla dimensione globale dei viaggi e delle comunicazioni. Localismo e comunicazione globale convivono in un equilibrio delicato, talora incerto e rischioso, producendo un'ampia gamma di situazioni che il turista apprezza perché non sono mai completamente prevedibili e scontate, pur essendo sempre aperte all'""altro"" che vi giunge.

Climate Politics and the Crisis of the Liberal International Order,['Felipe Leal Albuquerque'],"The election of Donald Trump brought disarray to the climate change regime. The changes in what was up to then a promoter of the liberal international order (LIO) exacerbated existing tensions while creating new ones. This paper investigates how that challenge impacted the behaviours of Brazil, China and the European Union (EU) by comparatively analysing their dissimilar positions with respect to three indicators before and after Trump’s coming into power. These indicators are individual pledges and climate-related policies; approaches to climate finance; and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC). The analysis first shows how the US started eroding the broader LIO and the climate change regime to then delve into the behaviours of the three respective key players concerning climate talks. I sustain that the EU, despite its inner divisions, is already counteracting Washington, whereas China is combining a pro-status quo position based on a rhetorical condemnation of the United States. Brazil, in turn, had a transition towards a climate-sceptic government, shifting from being a cooperative actor to abdicating hosting the COP25.",Article,1 , Contexto Internacional,Aug 1,0,"

The ontological politics of freshness: Qualities of food and sustainability governance,"['David M. Evans', 'Peter Jackson', 'Monica Truninger', 'João Afonso Baptista']","Freshness is a key feature of contemporary food systems, however its industrial production as a quality of food carries adverse consequences. Accordingly, this paper approaches freshness as a matter of concern. Drawing on extensive fieldwork across sites of food production and consumption in the UK and Portugal, we identify four enactments of freshness. The analysis zooms in on the specific case of plastic food packaging and uses these enactments to consider a series of questions about realities and the relationships between them. Since packaging is an issue that readily overflows to encompass a broader suite of propositions about food, we argue that freshness is a suitable focus around which to assemble hybrid forums to debate future possibilities. Joining a body of recent work that brings relational-materialist sensibilities to bear on sustainability governance, we demonstrate that these ideas are not exhausted by a concern with the ways in which existing ontologies are brought together in policy. To conclude, we suggest that attention to the multiple ontologies of qualities complements and extends approaches that focus on objects by offering a conduit that brings understandings of markets into discussions of ontological politics.",Article,1 , Environment and Planning A,,0,"

Social policy in the face of a global pandemic: Policy responses to the COVID‐19 crisis,"['Daniel Béland', 'Bea Cantillon', 'Rod Hick', 'Amilcar Moreira']","How have welfare states responded to the coronavirus pandemic? In this introductory article, we provide a synopsis of papers that comprise this special issue on social policy responses to COVID‐19, an overview of some of the key questions they raise, and some provisional answers to these questions. Our conclusions are threefold: first, these social policy responses, while entailing new developments in many countries, nonetheless reflect, at least in part, existing national policy legacies. Second, these responses can be understood as a form of “emergency Keynesianism,” which is characterized by the massive use of deficit spending during economic crises, with the aim of to supporting rather than challenging core capitalist institutions. Third, there are clear differences in terms of the nature of the reforms enacted during the initial phase of the COVID‐19 crisis as compared to reforms enacted as a response to the 2008 financial crisis.",Article,1 , Social Policy & Administration,,0,"

O PERFIL DO EGRESSO DA ENGENHARIA AMBIENTAL: PERSPECTIVAS E APONTAMENTOS PARA A IMPLEMENTAÇÃO DE METODOLOGIAS ATIVAS EM EDUCAÇÃO EM ENGENHARIA,"['Priscilla Silva', 'Ricardo Luiz Perez Teixeira', 'Palloma da Costa e Silva', 'Bianca Cabral Caldeira']","A busca pela renovação do ensino de Engenharia para o atendimento das inovações da indústria 4.0 tem gerado várias discussões acerca da necessidade de novas metodologias de ensino. As metodologias ativas se mostram como uma estratégia para uma mudança do ensino tradicional. Embora sejam vistas com certa resistência por parte de alguns docentes, os órgãos gestores dos cursos de Engenharia das universidades brasileiras têm estabelecido exigências para acompanhar as novas tendências do mercado. O objetivo deste estudo é avaliar o perfil do egresso do curso de Engenharia Ambiental de uma universidade pública brasileira, aferir as impressões e demandas desse público, bem como investigar se parâmetros das exigências dos conselhos de engenharia estão sendo cumpridos pela universidade em estudo. Os resultados apontam que o perfil do egresso não só traz indícios de como a universidade tem trabalhado as competências e habilidades nos cursos de engenharia, como também indicam as demandas do mercado de trabalho, no cenário nacional atual. Verificou-se também que as metodologias ativas têm um papel importante para se atingir as novas exigências. Conclui-se que a pesquisa do perfil do egresso auxilia a universidade nas tomadas de decisões acerca das possíveis mudanças, quanto ao andamento e desenvolvimento dos cursos de graduação, uma vez que trazem informações sobre as necessidades dos profissionais da área fora da universidade.",Conference Paper,,,Oct 19,0,"

"Articulating urban change in Southern Europe. Gentrification, touristification and financialisation in Mouraria, Lisbon","['Simone Tulumello', 'Giovanni Allegretti']","The global or planetary reach of gentrification has become a mainstream in critical urban studies. And yet, the 'travels' of a concept originated in specific places and times have often brought about a loss of explanatory and strategic power. In this article, we argue that another concept, that of articulation developed by Laclau and Mouffe, is particularly adequate to help gentrification, touristification and financialisation to travel among places and levels of abstraction. In order to make this argument, we focus on Southern Europe, whose cities had long been considered scarcely gentrifiable and where, more recently, critical urban scholarship has made large use ogf gentrification, touristification and financialisation to 3 explain the impacts of crisis, austerity, and afterwards economic rebound driven by real estate and tourism. We explore in multi-scalar perspective the trajectory of Mouraria, a historical neighbourhood in Lisbon-and particularly the dimensions of housing and local politics. We show how Mouraria, during the last decade, shifted from being a 'deviant' case-capable of taking advantage of neoliberal regeneration policies in order to keep its social diversity and most of its long-term residents-toward one 'paradigmatic' of urbanisation-as-accumulation and contentious urban politics. We explain this shift by focusing on its multi-scalar determinants; concluding that present urban change in many Southern European cities should be understood as the articulation of various processes, which include gentrification, touristification and financialisation.",Article,0 , European Urban and Regional Studies,Apr 16,0,"

Where the fields have no name: Urban-rural transitions in the Lisbon Region planning history,"['Teresa Marat-Mendes', 'Joao Cunha Borges', 'Sara Lopes', 'Mafalda Pereira']","This paper discusses the existing urban-rural dichotomy in Portuguese urban planning, assuming its importance on food-provision, a basic human need. Our analysis stems from an historical overview at two scales, regional and municipal, within the Lisbon Region. Specifically, we identify key changes between two time-periods: the mid- twentieth century, when design-based planning was established in Portugal for larger settlements, and nowadays, when it covers the totality of the national territory, based on land-use. We review these strategies, assessing what approaches would best encompass a sustainable transition of the food system. We start with the scheme of regional radial axis by architect Étienne de Gröer in contrast with the 2002 Lisbon Regional Plan. We furthermore expose two urbanization plans from 1940s: that of Vila Franca de Xira (1946) by Miguel Jacobetty and Faria da Costa and that of Palmela (1948) by João António Aguiar. Such plans, highly representative of the planning practices of that era, are then compared with their contemporary counterparts and subsequently with samples of their physical impacts on the ground, based on a morphological analysis of settlements and productive spaces in urban and rural contexts. Finally, we identify key changes for better use of productive soils within the Lisbon Region, considering challenges posed by international and national agendas.",Article,,,"Dec 30, 2020",1,"

A sombra do passado autoritário na Península Ibérica Os fracassos e o sucesso dos partidos populistas de direita radical,['Luca Manucci'],"Since their transition to democracy in the mid-1970s, Spain and Portugal were considered immune to populist radical right (prr) parties. In the last two years, however, the so- -called Iberian exception seems to have come to an end. Long-lasting authoritarian regimes governed both countries, but while Spain transitioned to democracy through a pact between elites that protected members of Franco’s regime from trials and prosecution, Portuguese democracy was the result of a coup started by the armed forces which then evolved into a social revolution. These different patterns of democratization produced different collective memories of the authoritarian past, with Spain that tried to silence its past for over two decades and Portugal celebrating the revolution that ended the Estado Novo. In turn, these different collective memories can contribute to shed a light on the resounding success of Vox at the 2019 elections compared to the more modest but still significant electoral breakthrough of Chega in Portugal.",Preprint,1 , Relações Internacionais,May 19,0,"

Food poverty and informal network support in a changing Portuguese rural area,"['Vasco Ramos', 'Monica Truninger']","Different representations of the “countryside” coexist in contemporary Portugal, from idyllic depictions to portrayals of emptiness and loneliness. Rural contexts close to urban areas are assumed to have informal support networks that can alleviate poverty and exclusion when institutional support fails. The incidence and intensity of food poverty are presumed to be lessened by proximity to food production sites and land ownership. In this paper, we aim to analyse how living in an intermediate area shapes the experience of food poverty. We draw on qualitative case studies of low‐income families living in between a predominantly rural and a predominantly urban territory in Portugal, which has been through a process of restructuring of its rural territory since the second half of the 20th century. Paying attention to the specificities of this intermediate context, including the availability of formal support, we will investigate to what extent informal support networks alleviate food poverty for these families. Our discussion adds to the scientific debate on food poverty and its links to social networks in intermediate areas previously embedded in predominantly rural territories. We also discuss the highly gendered nature of informal support and its significance for women enduring food poverty. This article is protected by copyright.

"Turbulences in the encampment archipelago: conflicting mobilities between migration, labour and logistics in Italian agri-food enclaves",['Irene Peano'],"The paper analyses the proliferation of different but intersecting regimes of mobility, and resistance against them, at the point of articulation of agricultural production with migration flows in contemporary Italy. The development of agri-food districts responds to a rationality of spatial zoning that in turn derives from the logistical re-organisation of supply chains. Such dynamics are shown to interact in complex ways with specific migration routes and their control, which also bear the effects of an encroaching logistical rationality. At times, these feed into the demand for cheap, just-in-time labour in agribusiness, whilst at others they clash with the needs of this sector. Racialisation represents a crucial tool of containment, together with a sexualised division of labour. The analysis is based on over eight years of participant, engaged research in several agro-industrial districts and migration hubs in Italy, among its migrant-worker populations, as well as in the countries of origins of some such workers (Nigeria, Romania and Bulgaria).",Article,1 , Mobilities,,0,"

Justice and power relations in urban greening: can Lisbon’s urban greening strategies lead to more environmental justice?,"['Jessica Verheij', 'Mafalda Nunes']","As urban greening has become a prevalent tool in the context of global climate governance, this paper examines Lisbon’s greening strategies in the context of its election as European Green Capital 2020. While applying an analytical framework based on environmental justice, we perform a cross-analysis of the city-wide greening strategies, together with a peculiar and unusual planning process for a new green space in the neighbourhood of Marvila. Based on qualitative research carried out in-situ, we argue that Lisbon’s greening strategies are based on a discourse of ecological benefits, without aiming to ensure access to green space for different population groups. Procedural justice concerns are widely undervalued, resulting in limited space available for community involvement. We show how urban greening is essentially a multiscalar exercise, impacted by and affecting multiple scales simultaneously. Hence procedural justice deserves a much more prominent role in urban greening, as participation and recognition can give local communities the opportunity to adapt global urban agendas toward their particular needs and desires. Our findings lead us to conclude that environmental justice is ultimately an exercise of multiscalar governance, where local decision-making needs to attend to contextual challenges but also to a long-term sustainability vision at a larger scale.",Article,0 , Local Environment,May 21,0,"

Vírus Expõe Falha Sistémica na União Europeia [Virus Exposes Systemic Flaw in the European Union],['Paulo Miguel Madeira'],"Covid-19 found the European Union in a situation of external dependence to obtain personal protective equipment and of weakened health systems in many countries. This made it impossible to adopt robust sanitary measures that did not involve the confinement of the general population of many countries and the paralysis of vast sectors of their economies. This created an economic shock of unprecedented dimensions since the Second World War that most likely will aggravate the dynamics of divergence between countries, which threatens to disintegrate the eurozone and the EU itself. In this context, trends are emerging towards some economic nationalism that is accelerating the deglobalization that has begun in recent years. [A covid-19 encontrou a União Europeia numa situação de dependência externa para obtenção de equipamento de proteção pessoal e com os sistemas de saúde de muitos países debilitados, o que impossibilitou a adoção de medidas sanitárias robustas que não passassem pelo recurso ao confinamento da generalidade da população de muitos países e a paralisação de vastos sectores das suas economias. Gerou-se assim um choque económico sem precedentes desde a Segunda Guerra Mundial, que muito provavelmente agravará as dinâmicas de divergência de desenvolvimento entre países, que ameaça desintegrar a zona euro e a própria UE.

Asian city prospects for planning and urban health,"['Jieling Liu', 'Deepti Adlakha', 'Marcus Grant[...]', 'Carlos Dora']","The current rapid, often unplanned urbanisation across Asia has wide-ranging economic, environmental, health, and social impacts. In an attempt to document the implications of this demographic transition, the Journal of Cities & Health in collaboration with the International Society for Urban Health (ISUH) launched a special issue. This special issue is composed of seven original research papers and one commentary that present a fair geographical coverage of urban Asia. This scholarship aims to: 1) enhance the state-of-the-art understanding of health risks, social vulnerability and adaptation policies in cities across Asia; 2) present case studies where local contexts were taken into consideration to respond to local health needs and cultural preferences; 3) highlight new evidence of health risks and the impact of the built environment; and 4) examine the use of emerging digital technologies and big data across diverse sectors for a more sustainable urban living environment. In the current context of COVID-19, new challenges, insights, and opportunities for change have arisen. Specifically, some crowded Asian cities offer successful approaches in battling early outbreaks of COVID-19 and provide a model for keeping the pandemic at bay, even if they can’t completely eliminate infections. Asian cities can make changes to design spatially distanced transport and recreation opportunities and the long-term implications for both infectious and chronic diseases. This editorial challenges urban policymakers to better align city planning processes with societal goals and public values, for sustainability, health and health equity, and to hold the people of the city as the central plank in all planning processes.",Article,1 , Cities & Health,Aug 12,0,"

Results provide the first evidence of how the effects of kill-save ratios and identifiability of the potential victims are contingent on one another. Specifically, this research shows that when individuating information about the potential victims is present in a trolley dilemma, participants are more reluctant to sacrifice three persons to save five than to sacrifice one person to save five.

Cross-contamination of lettuce with Campylobacter spp. via cooking salt during handling raw poultry,"['Nânci Santos-Ferreira', 'Ângela Alves', 'Maria João Cardoso[...]', 'Paula Teixeira']","C ampylobacter spp. are the most common bacterial pathogens associated with human gastroenteritis in industrialized countries. Contaminated chicken is the food vehicle associated with the majority of reported cases of campylobacteriosis, either by the consumption of undercooked meat or via cross- contamination of ready-to-eat (RTE) foods during the handling of contaminated raw chicken parts and carcasses. Our results indicate that cooking salt (used for seasoning) is a potential vehicle for Campylobacter spp. cross-contamination from raw chicken to lettuce, through unwashed hands after handling contaminated chicken. Cross-contamination events were observed even when the chicken skin was contaminated with low levels of Campylobacter spp. (ca. 1.48 Log CFU/g). The pathogen was recovered from seasoned lettuce samples when raw chicken was contaminated with levels ≥ 2.34 Log CFU/g. We also demonstrated that, once introduced into cooking salt, Campylobacter spp. are able to survive in a culturable state up to 4 hours. After six hours, although not detected following an enrichment period in culture medium, intact cells were observed by transmission electron microscopy. These findings reveal a “novel” indirect cross-contamination route of Campylobacter in domestic settings, and a putative contamination source to RTE foods that are seasoned with salt, that might occur if basic food hygiene practices are not adopted by consumers when preparing and cooking poultry dishes.",Article,1 , PLoS ONE,May 22,1,"

"Interwar Dictatorships, the Catholic Church and Concordats: The Portuguese New State in a Comparative Perspective",['Rita Almeida de Carvalho'],"Established in 1933 by Oliveira Salazar, the Portuguese New State was a civil, nationalist, conservative and corporatist dictatorship. A concordat was established between the New State and the Holy See in 1940, yet the treaty did not favour the Catholic Church to the degree one might expect from a Catholic interwar dictator. The fact that the political legitimacy of the Portuguese regime was not dependent on sanctioning by the Holy See justifies this apparent inconsistency. The distinctive features of the Portuguese concordat were enhanced by the authoritarian, rather than totalitarian, nature of the regime. Salazar, more so than Mussolini or Franco, was constrained by political forces not in favour of Catholic privileges. In addition, the dictator himself defended a strict separation of church and state as prescribed by the Portuguese constitution. Nonetheless, Salazar regarded the concordat as an important propaganda instrument that, in association with the 1940 Exhibition of the Portuguese World, would allow the internal and external prestige of the regime to be increased.",Article,6 , Contemporary European History,,0,"

Online Versus Offline Strategies in Comparative Perspective,['Tiago Silva'],"The Internet has undoubtedly become, in this last decade, an important new arena for political communication. Nonetheless, during electoral campaigns, the use of this medium poses both challenges and advantages for the institutional communication made by political parties and candidates. An often-overlooked advantage is the possibility, particularly on social media, for parties and candidates to bypass journalists and communicate directly to a large and varied audience. This aspect is particularly relevant since the literature has been noting, in the last decades, a decline in the salience of substantive political information in the mainstream news coverage of political events. By comparing the political actors’ campaigns on social media with press news coverage of those campaigns, this chapter examines the role and impact of the Internet on modern political communication. An extensive content analysis of four electoral campaigns in four different countries (United States, Italy, Brazil, and Portugal) shows that candidates’ and parties’ online campaigns, compared to news articles in the press, tend to be more frequently framed in terms of substantive political issues. Even though there are differences between political actors and the social media platforms used (Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube), the results suggest that, overall, candidates and parties do actually try to convey substantive political information when communicating directly to the electorate. Furthermore, compared to articles in the press, social media campaigns also tend to be less frequently framed in terms of conflict, political scandals, and strategy aspects.",Chapter,,,May 6,0,"

Negotiating work and family: caring for a dependant elderly parent in Portugal,"['Karin Wall', 'Sanda Samitca']","Portugal, as the other European countries, faces an increase of elderly dependant persons. This situation has considerable implications for families, frequently called upon to provide caring tasks. Portugal may be considered as having followed a specific pathway regarding the reconciliation of work and family life. On the one hand, norms emphasize a strong full-time work ethic, for both men and women and growing state support for families and care services; on the other hand, stress is laid on strong family obligations to care. In this paper we analyze the strategies of families in the context of this cultural double bind, whilst caring for dependent elderly parents. Qualitative interviews were carried out with adult children working full time and caring for a parent. Adopting a work-life balance perspective, we address the diversity of care arrangements identified, carers' perceptions of the main difficulties and pressures experienced, as well as the support they can rely upon in order to deal with the situation. The conclusion stress how the plurality of care arrangements is leading to a move away from a familistic care regime towards a more mixed care regime, combining both family care and formal paid services in diverse and complex ways.",Article,3 , SOCIOLOGIA E POLITICHE SOCIALI,Jun 19,0,"

Key to this is activating and increasing citizen participation in a fractal-like, multi scaled, community-led, bottom up planning process, where active citizens design, construct and are part of the futures they desire for their territories. 2019’s declarations of climate emergency show that decades of sustainable development have not worked. The Sustainable Development Goals are a positive step, but sustainability’s dependence on economic growth is problematic. Recognising Earth’s limits, this article builds on degrowth ideas and doughnut economic frameworks to examine the role of community-led urban transitions in catalysing a regenerative world, where ecocities are the normative goal of contemporary cities. Challenges in scaling the Global Ecovillage Network’s process to large cities are identified and some radical governance experiments examined. Attempting to bridge activism and academia, a transdisciplinary participative action research method is used to develop a Communities of Practice ecosystem to support an eco-social just transition. This work contributes to the European Network for Community-Led Initiatives on Climate Change and Sustainability, ECOLISE, the Horizon 2020 project UrbanA investigating Sustainable and Just Cities, and the Communities for Future action platform enabling translocal communities to connect, co-create a knowledge commons and help shape policy. Insights from Lisbon are examined with three community-led initiatives; Bela Flor, Ajuda and Marvila. These processes are still at the margins, but could so

"COVID ‐19, the Great Recession and social policy: Is this time different?","['Amilcar Moreira', 'Rod Hick']","This paper provides an overview of the initial crisis responses to the coronavirus pandemic and asks whether and how both the nature of the COVID‐19 crisis and the national responses to this differ from those witnessed during the Great Recession. We argue that the speed and scale of the crisis are indeed distinctive, but that claims of symmetry—a crisis affecting all equally—are misplaced. We suggest that stimulus packages have, in broad terms, reflected the scale of the threat and that the wage subsidies and employment supports that were introduced or adjusted are novel in scope and scale, with innovative developments. There has been a greater emphasis on housing than was apparent in responses to the Great Recession and, while a focus on taxation in response packages has been a focus in both crises, its form differs, with a greater reliance on deferrals rather than tax reductions in the stimulus plans announced to date. Our account stresses the agility of crisis responses and this agility must be regarded as welcome, mitigating a great deal of social harm during the initial phase of the pandemic. Whether these short‐run responses create pressures for wider‐ranging change is much debated, but highly uncertain.",Article,1 , Social Policy & Administration,Jan 7,0,"

How Fair is Economic Inequality? Belief in a Just World and the Legitimation of Economic Disparities in 27 European Countries,"['Efraín García-Sánchez', 'Isabel Correia', 'Cicero Roberto Pereira[...]', 'Jorge Vala']","This paper aims to examine the role of Belief in a Just World (BJW; Lerner, 1980) in the legitimation of economic inequality. Using data from 27 European countries (N=47,086), we conducted multilevel analyses and found that BJW positively predicted the legitimation of economic inequality, measured by three indicators: the perceived fairness of the overall wealth inequality, and the fairness of the earnings made by the Top 10% and the Bottom 10% of society. These results persisted after controlling for individual- and country-level variables. Moreover, the BJW effect was stronger on the legitimation of the Bottom 10% incomes, compared to the legitimation of the Top 10%. We also found that economic inequality at the country-level reduced the BJW effect on legitimation of inequality. Finally, BJW displayed a negative indirect effect on support for redistribution, via the legitimation of economic inequalities.",Article,1 , Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,Mar 24,1,"

Social Dominance Orientation Boosts Collective Action Among Low-Status Groups,"['Catarina L. Carvalho', 'Isabel R Pinto', 'Rui Costa-Lopes[...]', 'Jose M. Marques']","We propose that low-status group members' support for group-based hierarchy and inequality (i.e., social dominance orientation; SDO) may represent an ideological strategy to guarantee the legitimacy of future ingroup status-enhancement. Specifically, we argue that, under unstable social structure conditions, SDO serves as an ideological justification for collective action tendencies aimed at competing for a higher status. In such context, SDO should be positively related with actions aimed to favor the ingroup (i.e., collective actions) by increasing group members' motivation to engage in direct competition with a relevant higher-status outgroup. We conducted two studies under highly competitive and unstable social structure contexts using real life groups. In Study 1 (N = 77), we induced Low vs. High Ingroup (University) Status and in Study 2 (N = 220) we used competing sports groups. Overall, results showed that, among members of low-status groups, SDO consistently increased individuals' motivation to get involved in actions favoring the ingroup, by boosting their motivation to compete with the opposing high-status outgroup. We discuss the results in light of the social dominance and collective action framework.",Article,1 , Frontiers in Psychology,,1,"

"An Authoritarian Third Way in the Era of Fascism: Diffusion, Models and Interactions in Europe and Latin America",['António Costa Pinto'],"This book takes a transnational and comparative approach that analyses the process of diffusion of a third way in selected transitions to authoritarianism in Europe and Latin America. When looking at the authoritarian wave of the 1930s, it is not difficult to see how some regimes appeared to offer an authoritarian third way some- where between democracy and fascism. It is in this context that some Iberian dictatorships, such as those of Primo de Rivera in Spain, Salazar’s New State in Portugal, and the short-lived Dollfuss regime in Austria, are mentioned frequently. Especially during the 1930s, and in those parts of Europe under Axis control, these models were discussed and often adopted by several dic- tatorships. This book considers how and why these dictatorships on the periphery of Europe, especially Salazar’s New State in Portugal, inspired some of these regimes’ new political institutions particularly within Europe and Latin America. It pays special attention to how, as they proposed and pursued these authoritarian reforms, these domestic political actors also looked at these institutional models as suitable for their own countries.",Book,,,,0,"

The conditions of possibility of the ethnographic gesture: a reply to Philip Swift,['Joao Pina-Cabral'],"This text is a response to Philip Swift's paper, where he critiques issues concerning ethnographic theory raised in my book World: An anthropological examination (2017, HAU Books). Inspired by the work of Donald Davidson, I argue that indeterminacy and underdetermination are conditions for all communication and that, in light of that, a position of metaphysical pluralism provides us with a better account of the conditions of possibility of the ethnographic gesture than the kind of ontological pluralism that Swift espouses. I thank Philip Swift for his learned paper, as well as the editors of HAU, both of whom have generously granted me this opportunity to debate the epistemological bases of the conditions of possibility of the ethnographic gesture. I embarked upon this project in the 1990s and it remains an ongoing task; World (2017) turned out to be merely the first relay station on that voyage. 1 Some might argue that Swift's preference for a stress on failure to communicate and my preference for a stress on the possibility of communication are a matter of a glass half full or a glass half empty. After all, he comes to agree with me that 'worlds are not cosmic capsules, self-contained and sealed off from each other.' Very well then, so if that is the case, what are the conditions of possibility of that communicability which makes ethnography possible? This is what I have aimed to investigate, and that is why I am so disturbed by the focus on linguistic and cultural incommunicability that permeated our discipline at the turn of the twentieth century.",Preprint,,,,0,"

Tackling urban disparities through participatory culture-led urban regeneration. Insights from Lisbon,"['Roberto Falanga', 'Mafalda Nunes']","In the last few decades, the diffusion of culture-led urban regeneration schemes has intercepted the growth of participatory approaches across a wide range of policy domains. Partnerships between private and public agencies have sought, accordingly, the engagement of citizens and stakeholders to push forward context-specific interventions. From the participatory action research developed in Lisbon, one of the cities funded under the EU-funded project ROCK, we analyse the ways in which this project has tackled spatial divides and socioeconomic inequalities in the project demonstration area. Our main argument is that operational decisions and substantive mismatches have given rise to opportunities and bottlenecks throughout the implementation of the project. While the public investment has been directed to regenerate a deprived area, it has fallen short of promoting greater connections within the area and with the surrounding neighbourhoods. ROCK’s actions have only partially met local community expectations regarding the project’s objectives for the optimisation of tangible and intangible cultural heritage, with impacts over degrees of citizen engagement in the local Living Lab.",Article,1 , Land Use Policy,Sep 1,0,"

Greece: Debates in a Party-dominated System with Clientelistic UnderpinningsDebates in a Party-dominated System with Clientelistic Underpinnings,"['Yanis Kartalis', 'Marina Costa Lobo']","This chapter examines the politics of legislative debate in Greece. The Greek parliament, a relatively under-researched institution, is an interesting case in this volume’s context for at least two reasons. First, because of how the country’s institutional and party system intricacies do not allow for a straightforward classification along the Proksch and Slapin scheme, placing it somewhere between the two extremes. Second, because of the severe restructuring of the party system during the previous decade as a result of the Eurozone crisis and how it could have potentially strengthened the parliament. We make use of an original dataset on parliamentary speechmaking in the Greek parliament spanning twenty years of plenary debates to try to identify the determinants of floor access. Our analysis shows that women speak less than men. Cabinet members dominate the debate while we find some evidence that party leaders guard floor access and refrain from delegating speech time to backbenchers.",Chapter,,,Oct 8,0,"

Governing expectations of forensic innovations in society: the case of FDP in Germany,"['Nina Amelung', 'Helena Machado']","This article is about the governance of expectations of forensic DNA phenotyping (FDP) innovations in Germany used for the prediction of human externally visible traits such as eye, hair, and skin color, as well as biological age and biogeographic ancestry. In 2019, FDP technologies were regulated under the label ""extended DNA analysis"". We focus on the expectations of members of the forensic genetics' community in Germany, in anticipation and response to those of regulators who advocated for such technologies. Confronted with regulators' expectations of omnipotent technologies and the optimistic promise that they will enhance public security, forensic geneticists responded with attempts to adjust such expectations, specifying limits and risks, along with a particular logic sorting matters of concern. We reflect on how forensic geneticists' govern expectations through forms of distributed anticipatory governance, delimiting their obligations, and distributing accountability across the criminal justice system.",Article,1 , New Genetics and Society,,0,"

Living with the Beast: Wolves and Humans through Portuguese Literature,"['Margarida Lopes Fernandes', 'Filipa F. Soares', 'Frazão-Moreira Amélia', 'Ana Isabel Queiroz']","This paper explores representations of wolves in Portuguese literature using an anthropological framework to analyze perceptions, beliefs, knowledge, and practices. From a literary corpus compilation, 262 excerpts from 68 works that made reference to wolves were classified by grid analysis into 12 categories, encompassing the diversity of meanings attributed to these animals. Among wild carnivores, the wolf appears most frequently in the literary corpus analyzed. Most references concern conflict and economic losses caused by wolves’ attacks, relating to a utilitarian view of the wild prevalent in rural communities. Nonetheless numerous excerpts reveal closeness with humans and the existence of an ecological knowledge. Writings from the early twentieth century express admiration for wolves and acknowledge their right to exist. Some focus on practices like organized hunts, bounties, or domestication attempts. The negative views depict the wolf as a scapegoat for the shortcomings of rural life. The human desire to control the wolf represents the conquest of the wild. The wolf in literature is the object of further symbolic attributions, associated with witchcraft, religion, specific beliefs and lore but also with freedom and the dark inner self of humans. Overall these mixed views express ambivalent feelings toward the species. The results of this case study demonstrate that humans have multiple views of wolves, views that are not necessarily polarized into negative or positive extremes but that coexist: the vermin and the noble beast. In rural communities the wolf is not viewed as a fragile animal needing protection or as a modern symbol of wilderness. This study is a contribution from anthropology to the understanding of the wolf's cultur

Highlighting supranational institutions? An automated analysis of EU politicisation (2002-2017) View supplementary material,"['Tiago Silva', 'Yani Kartalis', 'Marina Costa Lobo']","This article examines, using automated text analyses, the EU politicisation in the media of six Eurozone countries (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain), between 2002 and 2017. By contrasting creditor and debtor countries, the article analyses how the Eurozone crisis affected the politicisation of the EU and its institutions using a unique dataset of 165,341 articles from 12 newspapers. The results show that the Eurozone crisis increased the politicisation of the EU, particularly in the countries that were at the forefront of the Eurozone bailouts. Importantly, the crisis contributed as well to a more multifaceted news coverage of the European Union, namely with a greater emphasis given to supranational institutions vis-à-vis intergovernmental ones. Yet, this supranational coverage was associated with the increasingly negative tone of articles. To that extent, this study shows that greater mention of EU institutions may not necessarily contribute to a Europeanisation of public debates.

Although the causes of these developments are complex and multifaceted, here we focus on one factor: the extent to which citizens express materialist and post-materialist concerns. We explore whether objective higher levels of democracy are differentially associated with materialist and post-materialist concerns and, in turn, whether this is related to the wish for a strong leader. Testing this hypothesis across 27 countries (n = 5,741), demonstrated a direct negative effect of democracies’ development on the wish for a strong leader. Further, multi-level mediation analysis showed that the relation between the Democracy Index and the wish for a strong leader was mediated by materialist concerns.

This study aimed to explore young people’s needs across several European countries in relation to learning about and implementing food hygiene and food safety. Qualitative focus groups and interviews were conducted in rural and city regions across England, France, Hungary and Portugal. Data were collected to attain data saturation, transcribed, thematically analysed, and mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework. Twenty-five out of 84 schools approached (29.8%) participated, with data collected from 156 11–18-year-old students. Students had good knowledge of personal hygiene but did not always follow hygiene rules due to forgetfulness, lack of facilities or lack of concern for consequences. Students had limited understanding of foodborne microbes, underestimated the risks and consequences of foodborne illness and perceived the “home” environment as the safest. Young people preferred interactive educational methods. Addressing gaps in young people’s food safety knowledge is essential to improve their lack of concern towards foodborne illness and motivate them to follow food hygiene and safety behaviours consistently.

The case of Fruta Feia in Lisbon.,['Alexandra Bussler'],"The aim of this paper is to explore which motivations, including individual characteristics and attitudes towards ethical sustainability, motivate the consumers of Fruta Feia. Additionally, it aims to obtain a typology of the consumers of AFNs. The general expectations are to see that i) there exist different motivations for sustainable and alternative food systems, such as Fruta Feia, and that these can range from ethical considerations of sustainability to instrumental ones; and ii) there exists a variation in the motivations that lead to consume the products from Fruta Feia, depending on certain socio-economic factors. For instance, we would expect to see that younger persons that live in the city centre of Lisbon are motivated by ethical considerations related to sustainability than the mother of a numerous family in the economically deprived area of Amadora, who might rather be motivated by monetary or convenience factors. Yet, because of the little evidence of previous studies in this particular field, it is not clear if this assumption holds and therefore an empirical case study will help to shed some light on this issue",Research Proposal,,,May 21,1,"

Background This study draws on a multidimensional approach to attitudinal change in DLF and in the division of parental involvement after divorce/separation. Empirically, it benefits from new measures on fatherhood and motherhood and population‐based data. Method The authors draw on the 2012 Portuguese ISSP module by focusing on three dimensions: types of children's residence; men's involvement in parenting and homemaking; and women's employment and primacy as caregivers. They examine the interplay between attitudinal, family, and sociodemographic variables through regression, multiple correspondence, and cluster analyzes. Results The attitudes to DLF strongly shape the attitudes toward the type of children's residence, which contribute to polarization between preferences for sole residence and shared residence. Also, three attitudinal profiles—unilateral egalitarian familism, egalitarian familism, and mother‐centered familism—revealed attitudinal hybridization through the complex combination of egalitarianism, essentialism and familism, and their embeddedness in social contexts. Conclusion By moving beyond the nuclear family and by combining standard and innovative attitudinal indicators of DLF, the findings shed light on the social processes that are creating complexity and plurality in the attitudes toward cultural models of motherhood and fatherhood.",Article,1 , Journal of Marriage and Family,,0,"

Zúquete'],"The Routledge International Handbook of Charisma provides an unprecedented multidimensional and multidisciplinary comparative analysis of the phenomenon of charisma – first defined by Max Weber as the irrational bond between deified leader and submissive follower. It includes broad overviews of foundational theories and experiences of charisma and of associated key issues and themes. Contributors include 45 influential international scholars who approach the topic from different disciplinary perspectives and utilize examples from an array of historical and cultural settings. The Handbook presents up-to-date, concise, thought-provoking, innovative, and informative perspectives on charisma as it has been expressed in the past and as it continues to be manifested in the contemporary world by leaders ranging from shamans to presidents. It is designed to be essential reading for all students, researchers, and general readers interested in achieving a comprehensive understanding of the power and potential of charismatic authority in all its varieties, subtleties, dynamics, and current and potential directions.",Book,,,Jan 15,0,"

The impact of biological and cultural racisms on attitudes towards immigrants and immigration public policies,"['Alice Ramos', 'Cicero Roberto Pereira', 'Jorge Vala']","Based on ESS-7 data, this paper focuses on two attitudinal dimensions about public policies related to immigration: how many can come and who can come. In this context, the hypothesis concerning the bi-dimensionality of racism was supported and, as predicted, biological racism is more anti-normative than cultural racism. Both biological and cultural racism predict opposition to immigration and adhesion to ethnicist criteria on the selection of immigrants. As hypothesised, the relationship between racism and opposition to immigration and adhesion to ethnicist criteria is mediated by threat perceptions. Specifically, symbolic and realistic threats mediate the effect of biological and cultural racism on opposition to immigration and on ethnicist criteria. The hypothesis that the mediation effects are moderated by the country’s quality of democracy was supported, indicating that the mediation effects are stronger in countries with a higher quality of democracy. Results are discussed within the context of racism theories as a bi-dimensional concept and in the framework of the role of legitimation processes in social discrimination.",Article,9 , Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,,1,"

Editorial_Finisterra_Vol. 52 N.º 104 (2017),"['Joao Morais Mourato', 'Paulo Morgado']","A prática do ordenamento do território, o desenho, implementação e avaliação dos seus instrumentos, é um ato fundamentalmente político. Político no sentido em que são decisões de natureza política que definem as matrizes de atribuição de poder e de recursos que, por sua vez, determinam a evolução dos territórios. Contudo, a ênfase predominante no debate académico nacional, tem sido em torno do ordenamento do território enquanto política pública e não enquanto arena de ação política de profundo impacto na res pública. neste sentido, os conflitos-implícitos e explícitos-derivados da intervenção no território podem, enquanto objecto de estudo na investigação e conceptualização do pensa-mento geográfico, promover a (re)politização do debate académico sobre os fundamentos da prática do ordenamento do território em Portugal. esta (re)politização é, no nosso entender, justificada pelo crescente número de soluções alternativas de governança territorial que emergem no contexto nacional. estas soluções resultam da adoção de uma filosofia de intervenção integrada no território como resposta à crescente complexidade de gestão do mesmo. Destas soluções alternativas gera-se também uma nova convivência entre interesses já solidamente organizados e outros ainda em processos embrionários de mobilização, organização e institucionalização. estes últimos, em particular , representam: (i) uma janela de inovação face aos padrões tradicionais de mobilização e intervenção da sociedade civil e (ii) um teste aos limites dos atuais mecanismos de legitimação e democratização da intervenção pública no território.",Cover Page,,,Feb 21,0,"

"Trusted land : land deals, climate vulnerability and adaptation in Northern Mozambique",['Carla Gomes'],"The surge of private land concessions in Sub-Saharan Africa carries the potential to push local populations to marginal areas, aggravating their climate vulnerability. This paper analyses the effects of resettlement on the vulnerability of relocated rural communities in Mozambique, from the perspective of environmental justice. The research seeks to understand how land concessions interfere with autonomous processes of adaptation that are not recognised within land distribution policies. The findings draw on a qualitative field research in two locations, in the provinces of Nampula and Cabo Delgado, where levels of poverty have persisted despite national trends of economic growth. The paper highlights how climate events inflluence perceptions of fairness amongst resettled populations, and how resettlements constrain their adaptative capabilities. The findings raise concern that misrecognition of adaptation practices can exacerbate the vulnerability of households to environmental change and to food insecurity, thereby hindering the fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG1 (No Poverty), SDG10 (Reduced Inequalities) and SDG13 (Climate Action). The author argues for the centrality of recognition within environmental justice, while contributing recommendations to ensure that land deals fulfil principles of distributional and procedural justice, which take into consideration the compound pressures of land use changes and climate vulnerability.",Article,0 , Climate and Development,Jan 5,0,"

Becoming a Heavily Tattooed Young Body: From a Body Experience to a Body Project,['Vítor Sérgio Ferreira'],"Why some young people start to tattoo their bodies? And why some of them keep going on with this practice, until having all body tattooed? What doing so means to them? These are some of the questions that underlie a qualitative research project carried out in Portugal on heavily tattooed young people. In this article, the author discusses their embodied trajectory from the first experiences to their involvement in a body project, and explains the meanings involved in this extreme corporeality. The analysis takes into consideration the structural dynamics that define how young people live their transitions and their identity construction nowadays to contextualize what appears as individual experiences and projects without reifying the individual as a privileged site of knowledge. Based on in-deph comprehensive interviews, the author demonstrates that the engagement of young people in this permanent body modification project represents an embodied struggle for the maintenance of a desired subjectivity. In an increasingly liquid and uncertain society, some young people ink larges extensions of their bodies searching for social recognition as different, authentic, and autonomous individuals and trying to maintain their core identity during transitional turning points.",Article,1 , Youth & Society,Dec 7,0,"

“Do perceptions of EMU alter clarity of responsibility? A comparison of German and Greek electorates”,"['Marina Costa Lobo', 'Roberto Pannico']","The goal of this paper is to understand whether perceptions of supranationalisation of economic policy mitigate economic voting in the Eurozone. We focus on two countries with divergent performances in the Eurozone: Germany and Greece, and make use of a novel dataset, which contains all necessary items to test this hypothesis. Our comprehensive vote model shows that in both countries economic voting occurs. However, once we interact perceptions of EU responsibility with perceptions of economic performance, we obtain diverging results: in Germany, the weight of economic perceptions on vote increases when citizens assign a higher responsibility to the EU for the country's economic situation. This is the opposite of what the “blurring of responsibility” posits. On the contrary, Greek electors are in line with expectations of our main hypothesis. Moreover, in this country we also found support for the idea that only citizens with a high level of political sophistication are able to incorporate the distribution of responsibilities for the economic policy in their vote calculus. Our results suggest that the blurring of responsibility effect on the vote may not be systematic across the Eurozone.",Article,1 , Electoral Studies,,0,"

Sustainable Development Goals in Portuguese Speaking Countries: The Perspective of Environmental Education Experts,"['João Guerra', 'Luísa Schmidt', 'Leonor Prata']","Portuguese-speaking countries are at different levels in the process of promoting environmental education and sustainability. In recognition of the political and cultural ties within a considerable diversity of socio-economic conditions, a pioneering study was developed in 2017 to map and establish a diagnostic of Environmental Education’s (EE) realities and “sustainability norms legislation” in the Lusophone nations. Three years later, the EE2CPLP survey, implemented in 2020, builds upon and streamlines the first edition, considering the current context marked by Agenda 2030 and the impacts and concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the survey was divided into three main sections: (1) Contexts and EE approaches in the CPLP countries; (2) Place and role of children and youth in the field of EE and (3) Coronavirus pandemic environment, against the backdrop of Agenda 2030. In the following chapter, we will address EE’s cross-cutting nature, its selective traditions (i.e., positivist, normative, and pluralist) and its role for sustainable development and the 2030 Agenda. Looking for the perspective of stakeholders and experts in Environmental Education (EE) and sustainability, we will assess the perceived impact of the current health crisis, which compounds the climate crisis, exacerbating the socio-economic issues within Portuguese-speaking countries.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Populism and Nationalism Revisited. A Comparative Study of the Spanish and Portuguese New Left,"['Filipe Carreira da Silva', 'Luca Manucci', 'David Veloso Larraz']","Current definitions of populism are insufficiently determinate. They fail to distinguish between populism and nationalism. We propose to remedy this problem by advancing a new definition of populism as the logic of democratic resentment. We apply this new definition to a comparison between Spain's Podemos and Portugal's Left Bloc (BE), which we classify as social carriers of populism. We make two contributions to the literature. First, our findings dispute existing characterisations of the Portuguese case, which fail to distinguish between populist and nationalist claim-making. Second, our analysis undermines depictions of Podemos as the consummate populist party in Iberia: in 2015, the little studied BE was a stronger populist carrier than Podemos. The analytical framework underpinning this conclusion offers a more refined approach to populism than the alternatives and sets a higher standard for empirical replication.",Article,1 , Nations and Nationalism,Dec 11,0,"

"The AMIGAS model: Reconciling prejudice reduction and collective action approaches through a multicultural commitment in intergroup relations (In press, Review of General Psychology)","['Ana Urbiola', 'Craig McGarty', 'Rui Costa-Lopes']","Social psychology's search for ways to address intergroup inequality has grappled with two approaches that have been considered incompatible: a) the prejudice reduction approach, that argues that changing individual negative attitudes will undermine the basis for discrimination and lead to intergroup harmony; and b) the collective action approach, that argues that social protest and activism can improve the position of disadvantaged groups. The problem is that efforts towards prejudice reduction may serve to suppress genuine efforts to change. We propose the Achieving Multicultural Integration of Groups Across Society (AMIGAS) model, in which a multicultural commitment is proposed as a driver of both improved intergroup evaluations and promotion of collective action for reduced inequality, especially in contexts where there are conditions for a respectful intercultural dialogue. The AMIGAS model is a theoretical advance in the field of intergroup relations and a basis for implementing effective egalitarian policies and practices.",Preprint,,,,1,"

"Policing the future, disrupting urban policy today. Predictive policing, smart city, and urban policy in Memphis (TN)","['Simone Tulumello', 'Fabio Iapaolo']","Significant resources and efforts have been devoted, especially in the USA, to develop predictive policing programs. Predictive policing is, at the same time, one of the drivers of the birth, and the ultimate material enactment of, the anticipatory logics that are central to the smart city discourse. Quite surprisingly, however, critical analyses of the smart city have remained divorced from critical criminology and police studies. To fill this gap, this article sets out the first critical, in-depth empirical discussion of Blue CRUSH, a predictive policing program developed in Memphis (TN, USA), where its implementation intersects long-term austerity for urban policy. The article, first, shows that there is no evidence of Blue CRUSH’s capacity to prevent crime, thus adding empirical material to skepticism over the role of predictive policing as a policy solution in the first place. And, second, it argues that, rather than making crime a matter of technological solutions, predictive policing shifts the politics therein – in short, it contributes to the expansion of policing into the field of urban policy at the same time as it disrupts present police work. These takeaways allow to further the critique of the salvific promises implicit in the smart city discourse.",Article,1 , Urban Geography,Feb 14,0,"

O Arquivo do Cancro: Um estudo da cultura material e tecnológica na génese da medicina oncológica em Portugal (1912-1926),['Ricardo Gomes Moreira'],"In this dissertation we aim to conduct the analysis of an archive of oncological collections as an object of material and technological culture, considering the conditions of its formation, the logic of its organization, its agency and the role it played as part of the development of the cancer studies in Portugal. Created in the University Hospital of Santa Marta, between the years of 1915 and 1926, the archive and the collections that it put together, containing various types visual and textual objects, allowed an efficient articulation between the academic activities of the founding group of cancer studies, their laboratory endeavour and the hospital work, establishing that archive as one of the most eloquent instruments in the scientific policy of the Portuguese cancer studies in this early period of their existence. The main purpose of this thesis is to present the archive as resulting from a new kind of clinical organization and as a consequence of the increasing complexity of the medical collections, in the sense that they seemed more prone to combine visual objects of mechanical representation produced by the medical use of photography or of the novel radiological skills, with the long-lasting typical objects of medical collections, such as molds and preserved organs. Moreover, radiological applications, surgical interventions or diagnostic procedures which comprised the main activities from which these objects were produced, participated in a clinical trajectory of disease where laboratory work had a ubiquitous presence. Hence, as part of a medical discipline that was adopting the new image based diagnosis (through radiography and microscope techniques) or the novel radiological therapies, the medical archive that

"Network ties, institutional roles and advocacy tactics: Exploring explanations for perceptions of influence in climate change policy networks","['Paul Wagner', 'Petr Ocelík', 'Antti Gronow[...]', 'Ana Delicado']","The extent to which a policy actor is perceived as being influential by others can shape their role in a policy process. The interest group literature has examined how the use of advocacy tactics, such as lobbying or media campaigns, contributes to an actor’s perceived influence. The policy networks literature, in turn, has found that network ties and occupying certain institutional roles can explain why actors are perceived as influential. When investigating what explains perceptions of influence, interest groups scholars have not accounted for network interdependencies and network scholars have so far not examined the advocacy tactics used by interest groups. This paper addresses the gap at the intersection of these two literatures by investigating the relationship between network ties, institutional roles, advocacy tactics and the presence of influence attribution ties in climate change policy networks. Exponential random graph models are applied to network data collected from the organisations participating in the national climate change policymaking processes in six EU countries that vary by the extent to which they are majoritarian or consensual democracies: Czechia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Portugal, and Sweden. The results show that network ties and institutional roles are better predictors of influence attribution ties than advocacy tactics and that there is no pattern in the relationship between advocacy tactics and influence attribution ties across different institutional contexts. These findings suggest that because influence is primarily associated with structural factors (network ties and institutional roles) that more established policy actors are likely to have more influence, which may inhibit the need for a significant step cha

Early release from prison in time of COVID-19: Determinants of unfavourable decisions towards Black prisoners,"['Mariana Pires Miranda', 'Rui Costa-Lopes', 'Gonçalo Freitas', 'Catarina L.

This study analyses how public support for such exceptional measures are determined by cognitive and ideological factors known to create and maintain racial biases in the criminal system. Participants were asked to express their level of agreement with the early-release of hypothetical prisoners. Results showed participants to be less favourable to the early-release of Black compared to White prisoners, when they had committed a stereotypically Black crime. As expected, the congruency between the crime stereotypicality and the colour of the prisoner’s skin did not emerge for White prisoners. Moreover, the difference between the agreement with the release of the Black vs. the White prisoner when both committed a stereotypically Black crime was higher as the level of endorsement of Meritocracy increased. Contrastingly, Anti-egalitarianism only predicted an overall disagreement with prisoners’ early-release.

Um olhar não heteronormativo sobre mobilidade epermanência em espaço urbano,"['Katielle Silva', 'Andrés Barreno Lalama', 'André Ribeiro[...]', 'Margarida Queirós']","The Coletivo Aleph project focused on the debate of everyday life in an urban space of people with different identities, gender expression and sexual orientations. These daily lives that take place in open public areas (squares, streets, gardens, parks), in semi-public spaces for recreation and leisure (cafés, gyms, sports clubs, shopping centers, etc.) and in private spaces (at home), are challenged when the questions who designed them and for whom the city was planned. This means that not all of these “socially accepted” spaces are inclusive, guarantee security, or promote affection and comfort. Perhaps because they are thought and designed through heteronormative lenses, their characteristics produce different effects on mobility, permanence, safety and, not uncommonly, produce exclusive practices. We ask, therefore, if these spaces are not, ultimately, those that allow the presence, mobility and action of certain groups and people, but inhibit the full access of others, leading to the debate on human rights, citizenship and the right to the city. The criticism developed by this investigation culminated in the development of a webdocumentary (digital tool available at http://www.ceg.ulisboa.pt/mpps/#3). The communicational instrument used to present our research (the webdocumentary) explores contents related to the urban experience of young university students with different identities, gender expression and sexual orientation, who narrate, discuss and criticize urban space designed according to heteronormative lenses.

A new Iberian exceptionalism? Comparing the populist radical right electorate in Portugal and Spain,"['Lea Heyne', 'Luca Manucci']","Since their transition to democracy in the 1970s, Spain and Portugal have been ‘immune’ to the success of populist radical right (PRR) parties.

Using new online survey data from the Spanish and Portuguese national elections in 2019, we find that the Iberian PRR electorate is mostly in line with the characteristics of the PRR electorate in Western Europe when it comes to socio-demographics, political dissatisfaction, media diet, and the rejection of immigration and feminism. Interestingly, however, the support for Chega and VOX does not come from economic losers of globalization. Finally, both parties capitalize on country-specific issues —national unity in Spain and welfare in Portugal— but PRR parties might struggle to establish themselves within the party system of the two Iberian countries.",Article,1 , Political Research Exchange,Oct 28,1,"

Inner transformation to sustainability as a deep leverage point: fostering new avenues for change through dialogue and reflection,"['Christoph Woiwode', 'Niko Schäpke', 'Olivia Bina[...]', 'Christine Wamsler']","This article provides a rationale for inner transformation as a key and hitherto underresearched dimension of sustainability transformations. Inner transformation relates to various aspects of human existence and interactions such as consciousness, mindsets, values, worldviews, beliefs, spirituality and human–nature connectedness. The article draws on Meadows’ leverage points approach, as places to intervene in a system, to reveal the relevance of inner transformation for system change towards sustainability. Based on insights from a series of dialogue and reflection workshops and a literature review, this article provides three important contributions to sustainability transformations research: first, it increases our conceptual understanding of inner transformation and its relevance for sustainability; second, it outlines concrete elements of the inner transformation-sustainability nexus in relation to leverage points; and third, it presents practical examples illustrating how to work with leverage points for supporting inner transformation. In sum, the paper develops a systematized and structured approach to understanding inner transformation, including the identification of deep, i.e., highly influential, leverage points. In addition, it critically discusses the often contentious and divergent perspectives on inner transformation and shows related practical challenges. Finally, current developments in inner transformation research as well as further research needs are identified.",Article,1 , Sustainability Science,,1,"

Fierce flames: Evoking wildfire disaster emotions through children’s drawings,"['Ana Sofia Ribeiro', 'Isabel Silva']","In the aftermath of catastrophes, art based participatory research has proven to be a useful tool for evoking emotions and knowledge in affected children, as well as for informing risk education and recovery psychology practices. Framed by disaster risk reduction and environmental philosophy, this article analyses a sample of drawings produced by schoolchildren aged 6–10 years old affected by the wildfires of October 2017 in the central inland region of Portugal, obtained using a ‘draw and write’ technique. The children’s narratives expressed concerns for their own safety and that of others, as well as concern for ecological damage. Emotional distress was also reported. The verbal statements accompanying the drawings helped the children to express their narratives carefully, allowing them to become active participants in their own process of thinking about the phenomena. We argue that children’s drawings constitute a valuable methodology to access children’s experiences after a disaster, as their visual richness reaches more than humans worlds. We recommend training for professionals, age-appropriate levels of informational support and a children’s disaster intervention model.",Article,1 , Global Studies of Childhood,Feb 24,0,"

"Thinking about generations, conjuncturally: A toolkit","['Joao Pina-Cabral', 'Dimitrios Theodossopoulos']","Since the early twentieth century, generation has been a recurrent concept in social analysis. In spite of successive bouts of critique and periods of relative neglect, the category has never been abandoned. In this article, drawing inspiration from a broad range of thinkers – such as José Ortega y Gasset, Karl Mannheim, Antonio Gramsci, Pierre Bourdieu, Raymond Williams and Stuart Hall – we review and fine tune our conceptual toolkit regarding generations, making more explicitly visible its affordances for social analysis in times of crisis. We focus on the problem of intergenerational overlap of contemporaneity and the contradictions that emerge from it. We argue that the notion of coevalness can help us resolve some of these contradictions – for example, the lag between contemporaneity and generational awareness – and introduce, through its horizontal connotations, a decolonising ethical stance. Favouring a processual understanding of generation, we recommend ‘conjunctural analysis’ as the most flexible analytical framework for resolving the intersectional contradictions and overlaps of generational categorisation.",Article,1 , Sociological Review,,0,"

Reducing Sexual and Reproductive Health Inequities Between Natives and Migrants: A Delphi Consensus for Sustainable Cross-Cultural Healthcare Pathways,"['Pedro Candeias', 'Violeta Alarcão', 'Miodraga Stefanovska[...]', 'Fernando Luís Machado']","The increasing number of international migrants (ranging from 153 million in 1990 to ~272 million in 2019) brought to attention the wide variation of national contexts concerning the policy measures to protect migrants' rights and ensuring their equal access to basic and essential services, namely in health. Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) is a key component to the overall health and quality of life and is impacted by power inequities inherent to society's institutions, environment, economics, and culture. In Portugal, guidelines for intervention in SRH are insufficient, a gap that is more pronounced with migrant populations due to the absence of culturally sensitive indicators to assess and monitor SRH. The aim of this work was 2-fold: to identify good practices in the SRH field, with a particular focus, whenever possible, on migrant populations, and to identify relevant and inclusive indicators to monitor SRH in Portugal. A Delphi panel (via online survey) with 66 experts (researchers, teachers, and health professionals) and 16 stakeholders (non-governmental organizations, civil society, and governmental organizations) was implemented in two rounds. Panelists were asked to state their level of agreement (5-point Likert-type scale) regarding four different SRH areas: Sexual Health, Reproductive Health, Social-Structural Factors, and Good Practices. Items were based on literature review and a World Café with 15 experts and stakeholders. Participation rate was 68% and response rate was 97% on the first round.

Moreover, this discussion also explores the centrality of food in the evocation of origin and its relevance among the things that circulate across the Atlantic Ocean, following the same route the families travelled.",Article,1 , Analise Social,Feb 12,0,"

POLITICAL TRUST AND SOCIAL COHESION AT A TIME OF CRISIS The Impact of COVID-19 on Kurdistan Region-Iraq,"['Mohammedali Yaseen Taha', 'Juline Beaujouan', 'Amjed Rasheed']","COVID-19 has attracted much attention in Kurdish neighbourhoods and has been relayed massively by the media across the KRI. Kurdistanis put their trust mostly in television as the most accessible source of information across the region. Conversely, social media was not considered a reliable source of information during the pandemic. The results of this survey highlight a strong lack of trust in federal political figures and institutions. At the regional level, Kurdistanis are divided along lines of political affiliation and geography. While respondents from Duhok and Erbil expressed a high level of trust in the KRG, people of Silemani are openly distrustful of the KRI government. The institutions responsible for mitigating the impact of the pandemic attract the highest level of trust across governorates. This is the case with the KRG Ministry of Health and Ministry of Interior, including the security forces and the police. Conversely, participants expressed strong rejection of both parliaments that sit in Baghdad and Erbil. The legislative body attracted the least trust among the population surveyed. The COVID-19 pandemic has fostered social cohesion in the KRI. The majority of respondents believed that all Kurdistanis, including both vulnerable and non-vulnerable groups, should be treated equally and should receive the same amount of government support during the pandemic. That being said, a significant number of respondents recognized the importance of caring for those most vulnerable, such as the elderly, Syrian refugees, and International Displaced Persons (IDPs) more broadly. Finally, respondents have been shown to rely mostly on their social circles and family throughout the crisis, rather than regional and federal institutions. Those

Educação Ambiental no contexto da CPLP: Um desafio urgente,"['Luísa Schmidt', 'Joao Guerra', 'Joaquim Ramos Pinto']","Os países lusófonos registam diferentes patamares na promoção da Educação Ambiental (EA). Um primeiro levantamento realizado em 2017 mostra que a EA é, em geral, competência dos Ministérios do Ambiente e da Educação, estando reservado um papel específico para o poder local e para as escolas. O apoio público está generalizado na maioria dos países, sendo, no entanto, mais significativo no Brasil e em Portugal. Já o apoio das organizações internacionais verifica-se, sobretudo, nos países de África e em Timor, enquanto as ONG nacionais, fundações e empresas nacionais a atuar no campo da EA estão presentes, ainda que a diferentes níveis, em todos os países e contextos. Em suma, estes primeiros resultados demonstram que a EA já entrou nas agendas pública e política de todos os países, embora de forma desigual e nalguns países ainda seja embrionária. Torna-se, assim, particularmente importante aprofundar o conhecimento e a análise do campo da EA nos países da CPLP, de modo a reforçar a eficácia da sua implementação e a melhorar as políticas públicas nestes territórios, garantindo maior resiliência para enfrentar os desafios que se aproximam.",Article,8 , AmbientalMENTEsustentable,,0,"

Ethno-racialisation at the intersection of food and migration regimes: Reading processes of farm-labour substitution against the grain of migration policies in Italy (1980-present),['Irene Peano'],"The paper puts the food regime model, as elaborated by scholars such as Harriet Friedmann and Philip McMichael, into articulation with the analysis of migration/border regimes, as proposed by critical migration scholars. If by now it is well established that the policies that regulate the mobility of migrant labour play a crucial role in enabling capitalist accumulation in contemporary global agriculture, few analyses have delved into the actual mechanisms which make this possible, and into their histories. The argument is developed by reference to the Italian case, showing how subsequent waves of substitution of Italian labourers with migrants, that began in the 1980s, have followed different patterns. It argues that these can be understood by reading them against the grain of the changes accruing in the transnational migration regime. Thus, precarisation and segmentation of the labour force in the farming sector are shown to have been actively fostered by policies which have made of undocumented or differentially included labour one of the pillars upon which globally integrated food production has relied for the past three decades. Whilst based on national-scale statistics and secondary literature, the analysis also builds upon a sustained presence and engaged participant research in some of the Italian agroindustrial enclaves that record the highest presence of migrant labour.",Article,0 , Social Change Review,,0,"

The Dugout Canoes of Bahia,"['Joao Pina-Cabral', 'Monica Chan']","This is a book about one of the more useful, durable and elegant tools that one can encounter: the dugout canoe. In Bahia (NE Brazil), these are preferentially made of an indigenous type of mimosa tree that has only survived because its shade served as excellent protection for cocoa bushes. On the one hand, they seem primitive; on the other, they are irreplaceable for the transport of things and people in the quiet, dark waters of the mangroves. For the fishermen and their women, dugout canoes transformed into a vast nursery what would otherwise be an environment inimical to human occupation. The canoe carpenters th ebook presents and the work they carry out with great simplicity – oblivious of the fact that they are indeed master sculptors – were the main impetus for writing this book. The photographs that Mónica Chan took during my long conversations with them eventually suggested the shape the book would take: a study about the tools humans use to mediate with the world; a study in ergology.",Book,,,,0,"

Washing hands and risk of cross-contamination during chicken preparation among domestic practitioners in five European countries,"['Pierrine Didier', 'Christophe Nguyen-The', 'Lydia Martens[...]', 'I. Maitre']","Nearly 40% foodborne outbreaks in the European Union are attributable to food practices in domestic homes that include handling and preparation of raw chicken. Hand washing is an important way to prevent cross-contamination with pathogens during chicken preparation. This study, which is part of the EU Horizon 2020 funded consortium SafeConsume, aimed at quantifying and understanding hand washing practices in three categories of households and five European countries. A quantitative survey (n=1889) was combined with qualitative research, during which 75 participants from France, Norway, Portugal, Romania, and the United Kingdom were observed and interviewed. An original method for analysing video with “The Observer XT” software was developed to identify when and how risk arises. The quantitative survey and qualitative research data revealed that touching raw chicken was more frequent in Romania and Portugal. Practices to avoid touching raw chicken were declared and observed, although observations revealed that these practices were not always consistently followed. Only a third of the participants washed their hands with soap after handling raw chicken with important variations among countries (a majority in Norway and in the UK, a few in France and Portugal, none in Romania), in contrast to the results of the survey. Observations and interviews suggested that rinsing hands with water only and washing hands with soap are considered equivalent by many people. Barriers to washing hands due to improper equipment were mainly observed in Romania. Washing hands after touching raw chicken was motivated by food safety concerns for some participants in Norway and the UK, but not in France a

Predictors of Burnout Among Physicians: Evidence From a National Study in Portugal,"['Alexandra Marques-Pinto', 'Sérgio Moreira', 'Rui Costa-Lopes[...]', 'Jorge Vala']","The aims of this research on burnout among physicians were threefold, (1) to characterize the burnout symptoms’ prevalence among Portuguese physicians, (2) to test the hypothesis that organizational demands and resources add, on top of other factors, to the explanatory level of burnout; and (3) to explore the predictors of organizational demands and resources. Data collection was conducted online at the national level in Portugal, with 9,176 complete replies and a response rate of 21%. Predictors stemming from theoretical models of an intra-individual, occupational, organizational, and socio-psychological nature were measured using an online/paper survey. Results were analyzed through a significantly modified version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) after transformations to address the fit of this measure in this sample. Results show that 66% of physicians have high levels of emotional exhaustion, 33% high levels of depersonalization, and 39% high levels of decrease of personal accomplishment. Moreover, a first set of hierarchical multiple regression models with burnout symptoms reveals that organizational resources, demands of the relationship with the patients and of work schedule are consistently important predictors of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization on top of other theoretically relevant predictors. A second set of regression models with the organizational-level variables shows that, aside from organizational variables, other context variables, like procedural justice and teamwork, have the most substantial predictive value. These results highlight the importance of recognizing physicians’ burnout as a phenomenon that is predicted by a wide variety of factors, but also the importance of attendin

Voices of contention: the value of development narratives in the age of climate (change) migration misconceptions,"['Cláudia Santos', 'Joao Morais Mourato']","This paper offers a fresh perspective on the predominant narrative that links climate change to migration. We review how this narrative is being used to promote securitization policies and to limit migration avenues. We propose a reinterpretation of this connection by drawing on its current critique and acknowledging the alternative conclusions that emerge from local perceptions of climate change. We explore human development perspectives to demonstrate how context-specific power structures and the politics behind the causes of (non-)migration, inhibit the freedom of choice by individuals and households over possible migratory decisions under changing climate threats and dangers. To achieve the well-being and social justice necessary for individuals to cope with the conditions of (non-)climate change, we conclude that current development aspirations must shift focus from human capital to human capability.",Article,1 , Climate and Development,Feb 1,0,"

Globalização e desenvolvimento desigual: perspetivas teóricas e alguns riscos políticos [Globalisation and uneven development: theoretical perspectives and some political risks],"['Paulo Miguel Madeira', 'Mário Vale']","Inequalities in the development of territories, at several scales, have intensified in the context of neo-liberal globalisation, due to the profound changes that globalisation has induced in the political economy on a planetary scale. Economic processes with earlier origins have deepened and broadened due to contemporary globalisation, assuming new prominence and inducing new generalised dynamics of concentration of population and activity in some territories and emptying in others, depending on their specific situation. These processes have also affected countries at the centre of the world system, such as the USA, the United Kingdom or France, leaving behind important portions of their populations and territories. This has generated political and electoral reactions that have put the systemic logic of globalisation at risk. [As desigualdades no desenvolvimento dos territórios, a várias escalas, intensificaram-se no contexto da globalização neoliberal, devido às profundas mudanças que a globalização tem induzido na economia política à escala planetária. Processos económicos com origem anterior aprofundaram-se e alargaram-se devido à globalização contemporânea, assumindo nova proeminência e induzindo novas dinâmicas generalizadas de concentração de população e actividade em alguns territórios e de esvaziamento noutros, dependendo da sua situação específica. Estes processos afectaram também países centrais do sistema mundial, como os EUA, o Reino Unido ou a França, tendo deixado para trás importantes parcelas das suas populações e territórios.

O Programa Erasmus e a Política de Mobilidade na Europa,"['Mateus José Alves Pinto', 'Thiago Sette Câmara']","A mobilidade acadêmica internacional pode ser definida como o deslocamento de estudantes, professores e pesquisadores para países diferentes de onde residem, com a finalidade de estudo, ensino ou pesquisa, assumindo durações e propósitos variados. A mobilidade acadêmica se tornou um aspecto essencial para a internacionalização do ensino superior, visto que muitas universidades possuem protocolos de intercâmbio com outras instituições. Este fato é reforçado pelo número de estudantes internacionais que já realizou algum tipo de programa de mobilidade acadêmica: 4.056.680 estudantes entre 2000 e 2013, em todo o mundo. Na Europa, a mobilidade acadêmica ocorre a nível continental através do Programa Erasmus, objeto de análise do presente estudo. Atualmente 34 países fazem parte do programa, que é considerado o maior e mais abrangente do mundo, seja em número de beneficiários ou de instituições participantes. O sucesso do Programa Erasmus contribuiu para que a política de mobilidade acadêmica na Europa fosse incorporada em diferentes acordos e documentos institucionais da União Europeia, refletindo-se na viabilização e ampliação de políticas públicas em diferentes áreas relacionadas com a mobilidade, como a educação e o turismo. Portanto, este artigo busca analisar de que maneira a mobilidade acadêmica, especialmente o Programa Erasmus, apresenta-se como uma política comunitária de integração europeia. De forma a alcançar o objetivo proposto, a metodologia deste estudo teórico é exploratória e descritiva, porque visa proporcionar maior familiaridade entre a relação da mobilidade acadêmica com as políticas comunitárias.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Shortening the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale using Optimal Test Assembly Methods: Development of the EPDS‐Dep‐5,"['Daphna Harel', 'Brooke Levis', 'Miyabi Ishihara[...]', 'Johann Martín Vega-Dienstmaier']","Aims This study used a large database to develop a reliable and valid shortened form of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), a self‐report questionnaire used for depression screening in pregnancy and postpartum, based on objective criteria. Methods Item responses from the 10‐item EPDS were obtained from 5,157 participants (765 major depression cases) from 22 primary screening accuracy studies that compared the EPDS to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID). Unidimensionality of the EPDS latent construct was verified using confirmatory factor analysis, and an item response theory model was fit. Optimal test assembly (OTA) methods identified a maximally informative shortened form for each possible scale length between 1 and 9 items. The final shortened form was selected based on pre‐specified validity and reliability criteria and non‐inferiority of screening accuracy of the EPDS as compared to the SCID. Results A 5‐item short form of the EPDS (EPDS‐Dep‐5) was selected. The EPDS‐Dep‐5 had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.82. Sensitivity and specificity of the EPDS‐Dep‐5 for a cutoff of 4 or greater were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73, 0.89) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.80, 0.90) and were statistically non‐inferior to the EPDS. The correlation of total scores with the full EPDS was high (r = 0.91). Conclusion The EPDS‐Dep‐5 is a valid short form with minimal loss of information when compared to the full‐length EPDS. The EPDS‐Dep‐5 was developed with OTA methods using objective, pre‐specified criteria, but the approach is data‐driven and exploratory. Thus, there is a need to replicate results of this study in different populations.",Article,0 , Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica,"Dec 29, 2020",0,"

How the public envisages the roles of science producers and mediators is mostly uncharted territory. We address this gap, by examining the results of a public consultation in Portugal concerning science communication. We show that the public demonstrates a clear preference for science communication performed by scientists, over journalists, although credibility and trust depend on multiple factors. We also ascertain that professional science communicators are mostly invisible, though the public recognises the value of `translators'.",Article,1 , Journal of Science Communication,,0,"

Informe FINAL Situación emigrantes mayores emigración en Alemania y retornados,"['Antonio Muñoz', 'Begoña Petuya', 'Miguel Montero']","Este proyecto de investigación analiza la situación de los emigrantes mayores en Alemania y de los retornados mayores desde Alemania. La relevancia del tema deriva en primer lugar de la necesidad de visibilizar la situación de dos colectivos invisibilizados y olvidados. De acuerdo con el Padrón de Españoles Residentes en el Extranjero (PERE) del Instituto Nacional de Estadística, a comienzos del año en curso un total de 569.673 españoles y españolas mayores de 65 años residían en el extranjero, lo que equivale al 22 % del conjunto de la emigración española. Probablemente el número de jubilados que perciben una pensión del extranjero por haber trabajado en otro país supere las 800.000 personas. Es decir, los mayores emigrantes y retornados tienen cierta importancia numérica. Pero más allá de los datos estadísticos, a veces parece caer en el olvido los enormes movimientos migratorios que protagonizaron estos españoles y españolas mayores. Este informe pretende recuperar la memoria histórica de estos colectivos. Además, entendemos que el reconocimiento a esas generaciones de emigrantes y de retornados necesariamente debería redundar en la mejora de los servicios que la Administración española presta a ambos colectivos. Por lo tanto, intentaremos hacer una aportación al debate sobre las estrategias y políticas necesarias para que el reconocimiento no se limite a un ejercicio retórico, sino que se traduzca en que emigrantes y retornados puedan ejercer sus plenos derechos de ciudadanía. Por último, creemos que el desarrollo de políticas de emigración y de retorno para los actuales flujos migratorios no puede tener éxito sin haber hecho un balance sincero de las políticas

The work takes the form of a critical view correlating business leader’s comebacks, after a career setback, and the concept of leadership. In the first chapter are presented and discussed the most consensual and updated leadership types/styles and the new trends in the leadership field. Subsequently, are addressed some myths associated with the concept of leadership – in this section, the concepts of Emotional Intelligence and Social Intelligence are discussed. In the second chapter, is presented the data and the outputs that resulted from the interviews made to three Portuguese business leaders. The interviews were made in order to gather and analyze information, finding out what are the common aspects of a career setback and of a fighting back process, and to understand and draw conclusions regarding how the Portuguese market and business environment reacts to leaders that are hit by failure. Next, are discussed the three phases of the fighting back process. The shock phase, the retreat and reaction phase, and the comeback phase. At the end, in the third chapter, a conclusion is taken regarding the achievability of a leader to overcome the ultimate challenge that is to transform failure into success.",Article,,,Sep 27,0,"

Sabia, por exemplo, que um tratamento adequado da documentação arquivada pela administração pública, preservando apenas a que tem valor probatório ou histórico, resultaria numa poupança de cinco milhões de euros só em instalações? Numa abordagem crítica, a autora deste livro parte da análise de casos e circunstâncias, do testemunho próprio e de colegas historiadores e arquivistas, para radiografar a gestão do património arquivístico nacional. Diz-nos que nem tudo está bem e explica porquê.",Book,,,,0,"

Performing wild geographies,['Filipa F. Soares'],"In October 2017, a transdisciplinary group of sixteen participants met at Knepp Castle Estate (West Sussex, Southeast England) for a two-day creative workshop. The event, entitled Performing Wild Geographies, was intended to be a cross-disciplinary experiment in engaging the public with the 'rewilding' movement. By embracing disparate disciplinary perspectives and methods, it explored how scientists, geographers and artists might work together through collaborative performance-making strategies.",Chapter,,,Oct 7,0,"

AÇÃO CLIMÁTICA E INOVAÇÃO INSTITUCIONAL AO NÍVEL LOCAL,"['Joao Morais Mourato', 'Giulia Iannuzzi']","RESUMO As alterações climáticas desencadeiam e acentuam riscos e vulnerabilidades sistémicas nos sistemas socioecológicos terrestres. Apesar da criação de soluções de governança multinível, globais, macro-regionais, nacionais e sub-nacionais abrangendo metas, marcos legais, normas e políticas internacio-nais, os vetores antrópicos das mudanças climáticas têm aumentado em ritmo e intensidade. A adaptação às alterações climáticas, enquanto objeto de política pública é um desafio multidimensional, de elevado grau de incerteza em relação aos riscos e impactos das medidas implementadas, que requer uma filosofia de intervenção integrada de base territorial, de natureza antecipatória face a um futuro pautado por uma inevitável mudança climática. Estas características desafiam os limites das culturas institucionais predominantes, sublinhando a necessidade de inovação quer ao nível processual, do desenho, financiamento e implementação de políticas públicas dedicadas, quer ao nível relacional, no desenvolver soluções de governança territorial multinível. Este texto é uma súmula introdutória à forma como, nos últimos 20 anos, a adaptação às alterações climáticas ganhou inquestionável centralidade no debate político e no quadro global, nacional e local de políticas públicas. Olhando para o padrão de governança climática local em Portugal através de uma lente institucional, o país mostra uma variação intra-nacional extrema. Decisivo para a capacidade de ação climática local é o processo de coprodução de conhecimento por meio do qual ela é alcançada, garantindo que novos entendimentos sejam realmente adotados e partilhados pelos atores envolvidos. Nesta medida o território nacional é

Children's experiences of food poverty in Portugal: Findings from a mixed‐method case study approach,['Vasco Ramos'],"While observers acknowledge that the 2007–2008 crisis increased food insecurity, few studies considered how being food poor affects children's daily lives. In this paper, I discuss how children from low‐income families in Portugal experience food and deal with food scarcity. I draw on data from a larger European study, which employed a case study approach with a combination of semi‐structured interviews and photo‐elicitation. Children's accounts reveal how food poverty is embedded in their lives, affecting the quality and quantity of food, reducing opportunities to socialize with kin and friends and creating emotional stress. Visual methods added depth to our understanding.",Article,0 , Children & Society,,0,"

As the digital turn has pervaded both social and academic milieus, we consider the potentials and shortcomings of remote interactions and approaches and how they have impacted our work and personal lives. We focus on the challenges of balancing paid work and the unpaid work of care, as well as considering potential changes to the concept of care in terms of building a caring culture.",Article,0 , Fennia - International Journal of Geography,Aug 29,0,"

Environmental surveying systems and effectiveness of actions in the Brazilian amazon,"['Eduardo Frederico Cabral de Oliveira', 'José Francisco De Oliveira Júnior', 'José Augusto Ferreira da Silva']","Weak governance over the Brazilian Amazon is jeopardizing both social and environmental balance. Moreover, the loss of this balance can have severe social, economic, and political consequences at local, national, and global levels. Therefore, we plan to answer how the Brazilian forest is being protected based on the perspective of the environmental military police integrating all states of the so-called Legal Amazon. The study came from a field survey conducted through a questionnaire sent to those police agencies. The research is based on exploratory and descriptive methods of qualitative and quantitative approach with both field research and literature review on the subject. We sought to evaluate publications that satisfactorily described the “state of the art” of the main research on the topic, as we strove for the quality and comprehensiveness of the research, and a field survey through a questionnaire applied to law enforcement agencies. The responses were organized into four groups, allowing an overview of the environmental inspection in the region. Although the Amazon Rainforest is the largest tropical rainforest in the world, it has been found that states in the region devote little human and material resources to its protection.",Article,1 , Mundo Amazónico,Aug 31,1,"

As radiações e a formação de uma ecologia institucional da medicina do cancro em Portugal (1912-1948),['Ricardo Gomes Moreira'],"The studies of radioactivity and the consequent flourishing of the sciences and industries related to the production of radiations left a distinctive influence in Portuguese medicine of early twentieth century. In this article I examine the ways in which the biomedical concept of cancer that emerged in that period was in close connexion with the development of “radiations’ economy” sustained by the clinical and scientific uses of radioactivity. I argue that such economy was grounded on “cancer” and “radiations” concepts and that both of these were constituted as a boundary objects that were capable of supporting (in the Portuguese context) a new institutional ecology of medicine through their mediation between different spheres of political, scientific, medical and industrial interests.",Article,0 , Analise Social,May 16,0,"

Quality of Life of People with Vitiligo: A Brazilian Exploratory Study,"['Emerson Do Bú', 'Maria Edna Silva de Alexandre', 'Vitória Medeiros dos Santos']","Vitiligo is a dermatological disease characterized by the presence of hypopigmented macules on the skin. Considering that its effects are not limited to the biological dimension of the subject, it is assumed negative impacts on the quality of life of their bearers. Yet, little attention has been giving to this phenomenon in Brazilian studies. This research sought to overcome this gap by verifying the relationship between sociodemographic variables of people with Vitiligo, as well as their perceptions of discrimination and severity of the disease in their qualities of life. It is a quantitative study with a descriptive and exploratory nature, in which 200 Brazilians with Vitiligo participated, most of them female (73%), with white skin colour (50.5%) and predominantly residents of Southeast Brazil (31.02%). For data collection, a sociodemographic questionnaire and the Vitiligo-specific health-related quality of life instrument (VitiQoL) scale were used. Results revealed that female participants, with black skin colour, low income and white patches in areas of easy social perception showed worse rates of quality of life. The findings are discussed with pertinent literature, and it is expected that they contribute to the development of public policies aiming to improve the quality of life of Brazilians with Vitiligo.",Article,1 , Revista de Psicologia da IMED,,1,"

Support for Group-Based Inequality Among Members of Low-Status Groups as an Ingroup Status-Enhancement Strategy,"['Catarina L. Carvalho', 'Isabel R Pinto', 'Rui Costa-Lopes[...]', 'Jose M. Marques']","We discuss the idea that competition-based motives boost low-status group members' support for group-based hierarchy and inequality. Specifically, the more low-status group members feel motivated to compete with a relevant high-status outgroup, based on the belief that existing status positions may be reversed, the more they will defend status differentials (i.e., high social dominance orientation; SDO). Using minimal groups (N = 113), we manipulated ingroup (low vs. high) status, and primed unstable status positions to all participants. As expected, we found that SDO positively mediates the relation between ingroup identification and collective action, when ingroup's status is perceived to be low and status positions are perceived as highly unstable. We discuss the implications of considering situational and contextual factors to better understand individuals' support for group-based hierarchies and inequality, and the advantages of considering ideological processes in predicting collective action.",Article,1 , Social Psychological Bulletin,,1,"

"Coffee on the move: technology, labour and race in the making of a transatlantic plantation system",['Marta Macedo'],"In the mid 19th century, plantations began to spread across multiple geographies of the Global South. This paper discusses this particular institution and phenomena, by focusing on the Atlantic circulation of coffee plants, agronomic knowledge and racialized labour practices. Combining approaches from mobilities studies and history of technology, it argues that plantations are particularly well suited to grasp the dynamics of displacement and resettling, and to connect the global and the local scales. More specifically, this paper follows a group of men, directly or indirectly involved in the trade of enslaved persons from Angola to Brazil, and analyses what travelled along with them, namely, plantation artifacts, technologies and ideas about labour and race. By doing so, it unveils the hidden links between the Paraíba Valley and São Tomé, and shows how plantations moved between these localities, and adapted to different social and natural environments.",Article,1 , Mobilities,Mar 9,0,"

The Reduced Impact of Impact Factors on the History of Economics CommunityL’effet réduit des facteurs d’impact sur la communauté des historiens de l’économie,['José LuÍs Cardoso'],"In this contribution I argue that the reduced impact of the impact factors’ culture in the history of economics community is due to three interlinked main motives, namely: the belonging to a disciplinary field with a reduced number of practitioners who tend to downgrade the relevance of quantitative metrics as a substitute for quality assessment; the preference for publication formats where books and book chapters play an important role; and the increasing adherence to alternative solutions for impact measurement. The discussion of these motives leads to the defence of new approaches fostering further improvements in the bibliometric coverage of academic outcomes, as well as in open access policies and publishing strategies.",Article,1 , OEconomia,Sep 1,0,"

A typology of urban speciality shops selling rural provenance food products -a contribution from Portugal,"['Alexandre Silva', 'Elisabete Figueiredo', 'Monica Truninger[...]', 'Teresa Forte']","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore and typify the characteristics and diverse features of urban speciality stores selling rural provenance food, taking the case of three cities in Portugal. Design/methodology/approach The study was based on hierarchical cluster analysis, performed upon data collected from a survey to 113 shops, located in Aveiro ( n = 15), Lisbon ( n = 56) and Porto ( n = 42). Findings The study identified three clusters of shops according to the type of rural provenance products sold, services provided and clientele characteristics: the wine focused, the rural provenance focused and the generalist. The study confirms that in Portugal, small food retail outlets, with different rural provenance patterns and degrees of specialization have considerably grown in large cities over the last decade. Research limitations/implications The study contributes to typifying urban speciality food stores selling rural provenance products and to addressing critical research gaps on this topic. The study highlights the dynamism of small food retail outlets and their significance, mediating and responding to changing patterns of food consumption in urban spaces. Originality/value This study contributes to a better understanding and characterization of food speciality shops in urban settings and their links with rural territories of provenance, an under-researched topic on the food retail literature.",Article,1 , British Food Journal,Apr 27,0,"

Sibling caring roles and responsibilities when a child suffers from a chronic illness,['Ana Patrícia Hilário'],"Siblings' lives and well‐being are potentially affected in profound ways when their brother or sister suffers from a chronic illness in childhood. The shift in the care of chronically ill children from the hospital to the home in recent years has had an impact on family relationships and interactions. Whilst studies on caregiving have focused on the parental care of children who are chronically ill; siblings may nevertheless take on some caring roles and responsibilities. This article intends to make a novel contribution to the sociological literature on siblings, caring, and chronic illness by presenting a review of the literature addressing siblings' caring roles and responsibilities in families of children with a chronic illness. Knowing about the caring roles and responsibilities undertaken by siblings when a brother or sister has a chronic illness, may be beneficial to healthcare professionals and influence their caring practice. In addition, this work may contribute to a better understanding of family relationships and further improve healthcare policies.",Article,1 , Sociology Compass,,0,"

Its About Time We Care About an Equitable World: Women's Unpaid Care Work and COVID-19,"['Nediana Sarrasanti Ardinugroho', 'Felix Kwabena Donkor', 'Cláudia Santos[...]', 'Chadia Wannous']","Unpaid care work, mostly performed by women, is a central but undervalued contributor to economies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for unpaid care work increased due to restricted movement, social isolation and economic challenges. This pandemic has highlighted the urgency of recognizing and valuing women's work at the household level which has been systematically overlooked. At the same time, it has increased the demand for technology usage, exposing the gender digital divide. This paper aims to shed light on the additional burden women are facing, especially when trying to balance unpaid care work with paid employment from the seclusion of their homes. We do this by reviewing a number of surveys conducted in Indonesia. We combine this with other examples from additional contexts in order to draw attention to a global trend of amplified inequalities and struggles women are experiencing. We advocate for an urgent paradigm shift by providing vital recommendations for policymakers and managers.",Article,0 , IEEE Engineering Management Review,Jul 27,0,"
