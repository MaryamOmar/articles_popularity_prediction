Mapping technology-harm relations: From ambient harms to zemiosis,['Mark A. Wood'],"This article develops a new approach to analysing the technology-harm nexus. The approach distinguishes between different technology-harm relations: relations with technology that are harmful by virtue of what they contribute to bringing about. In this article, I focus on categorizing generative harm relations: relations with technology that are harmful by virtue of what they do to actors. Drawing together insights from zemiology, moral philosophy, postphenomenology, Stiegler's technophenomenology, and Latour's actor-network theory, I distinguish six generative technology-harm relations: ambient harms, alterity harms, exclusion harms, interface harms, harm translation, and zemiosis. Distinguishing between these generative harm relations is, I argue, useful in accounting for the techno-sociality of a range of social harms, from gun violence and digital coercive control to forms of oppression, inequality and immiseration (re)produced by algorithms.",Article,1 , Crime Media Culture,Jul 17,0,"

Enhancing relationships between criminology and cybersecurity,"['Benoit Dupont', 'Chad Whelan']","‘Cybercrime’ is an umbrella concept used by criminologists to refer to traditional crimes that are enhanced via the use of networked technologies (i.e. cyber-enabled crimes) and newer forms of crime that would not exist without networked technologies (i.e. cyber-dependent crimes). Cybersecurity is similarly a very broad concept and diverse field of practice. For computer scientists, the term ‘cybersecurity’ typically refers to policies, processes and practices undertaken to protect data, networks and systems from unauthorised access. Cybersecurity is used in subnational, national and transnational contexts to capture an increasingly diverse array of threats. Increasingly, cybercrimes are presented as threats to cybersecurity, which explains why national security institutions are gradually becoming involved in cybercrime control and prevention activities. This paper argues that the fields of cyber-criminology and cybersecurity, which are segregated at the moment, are in much need of greater engagement and cross-fertilisation. We draw on concepts of ‘high’ and ‘low’ policing ( Brodeur, 2010 ) to suggest it would be useful to consider ‘crime’ and ‘security’ on the same continuum. This continuum has cybercrime at one end and cybersecurity at the other, with crime being more the domain of ‘low’ policing while security, as conceptualised in the context of specific cybersecurity projects, falls under the responsibility of ‘high’ policing institutions. This unifying approach helps us to explore the fuzzy relationship between cyber- crime and cyber- security and to call for more fruitful alliances between cybercrime and cybersecurity researchers.",Article,,,Mar 27,0,"

"Out of Time: Modernity, Historicity, and Temporality in Ernst Jünger’s War Journals",['Marilyn Stendera'],"The diaries that detail Ernst Jünger’s time in occupied Paris can be as frustrating as they are captivating. Their tone is often both elegiac and detached, at once keenly aware of and distant from the suffering occurring all around their author. This ambiguity becomes particularly apparent in the contrast between the remarkable everyday encounters the diaries describe and their broader cosmic and world-historical ruminations. In this paper, I want to suggest that this tension can be read as a response to the imperatives through which totalising thought shapes how subjects operating under its confines relate to time itself. This dynamic, which can already be found in Jünger’s own earlier work, is dramatized in the way that the diaries construct the alternative temporal perspective of the witness. The witness here is one who survives outside of, and yet also remains caught between, two temporal imaginaries characteristic of modernity: Totalising historicization – the sweeping narrative of progress that demands the sacrifice of the present individual and individual present – and mechanised temporality, that is, instrumentalised clock time.",Chapter,,,,0,"

The changing role of the FIRB and the politics of foreign investment in Australia,['David Ross Hundt'],"Australia’s policy on foreign investment aims to achieve both the liberal goal of maximising capital inflows and the statist one of ensuring that those inflows are in ‘the national interest’. This article analyses the tensions between these goals through interviews with policymakers who have direct knowledge of the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), which has functioned as an ‘offstage’, pre-market regulator for capital inflows to Australia. The tensions between these policy goals were manageable because the FIRB exercised its powers rarely, decisively and quietly, and the government believed that foreign investment did not threaten the national interest. The emergence of state-owned enterprises as foreign investors, however, significantly altered this calculus, and the FIRB has been tasked with assessing the national security implications of proposed investments. Instead of working offstage, as in earlier decades, the FIRB has become central to debates about how Australia should respond to the rise of China.",Article,0 , Australian Journal of Political Science,Jun 3,0,"

Situating a Basic Income Alongside Paid Work Policies,['Andrew Scott'],"A Basic Income (BI) seeks to thoroughly de-commodify labour in the long term. Ideas for such a new payment need to be realistically situated alongside policies to enhance opportunities for paid work, particularly for those people who need it most. In the short and medium term, better policies to support job creation, work/life balance, improved quality of working life and skills retraining will be needed alongside any steps towards a BI. The Nordic nations have partly de-commodified people’s labour through policy approaches of this kind. The ways in which those countries have done so are valuable for Australia and other English-speaking countries to consider and learn from.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Visibility and Vulnerability on Instagram: Negotiating Safety in Women’s Online-Offline Fitness Spaces,"['Kim Toffoletti', 'Holly Thorpe', 'Adele Pavlidis[...]', 'Claire Moran']","This article investigates how safety is experienced, navigated and cultivated by women on Instagram. Using qualitative interview data, we explore women’s understanding and practices of keeping themselves and others safe when sharing information-rich images about their exercising bodies and fitness activities. Drawing on literatures from feminist leisure, sport and media studies, this article advances discussions about exercising women’s negotiations of risk and safety by considering digitally-mediated fitness experiences and the uses of “visibility and vulnerability” for creating cultures and communities of physical and emotional safety online and offline. Findings identify that knowledge of Instagram’s platform affordances and audiences, along with personal ethics, contribute to exercising women’s decision-making when posting self-produced physical activity content. We extend current thinking about the operations of visibility and vulnerability for women online by identifying the significance of spatial and relational elements to generating women’s feelings of safety on Instagram.",Article,1 , Leisure Sciences,Feb 17,0,"

‘On a mission’: Christian Youth Workers in Australia in the 1960s–1970s,['David Fagg'],"The historical intertwining of youth work and Christianity is well-recognised, especially in the United Kingdom and in the early establishment of youth work in Australia. However, Australian youth work underwent significant changes from the 1960s to late 1970s. This article uses a representative case study approach to illuminate how Christian youth workers were active in this transitional time. It finds that Christian youth work efforts in this time (1) both entrenched youth ministry as a serious pursuit in Australia, and created space for Christian work in secular settings, thus (2) contributing to a divide between church-based youth ministry and secular youth work. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for contemporary youth ministry, and concludes by proposing areas for further research.",Article,1 , Journal of Youth and Theology,Jul 16,0,"

"Making publics in a pandemic: Posthuman relationalities, ‘viral' intimacies and COVID-19","['Kiran Pienaar', 'Jacinthe Flore', 'Jennifer Power', 'Dean A Murphy']","The COVID-19 pandemic has placed sexual relationships into sharp focus as strict containment measures, including physical distancing and ‘stay at home’ restrictions, were initiated to control the spread of the virus. Governments in some jurisdictions prevented contact between non-cohabiting sexual partners (except for couples in pre-existing relationships), while community organisations recommended people avoid casual sexual encounters. This article analyses Australian media articles, commentary and public health messages published during March to October 2020 to explore the normative assumptions underpinning these measures. Applying posthumanist perspectives and Warner’s (2002) conceptualisation of ‘publics’, we consider how COVID-19 public health advice enacts the (human) subject of public health as monogamous, coupled, and living with their partner or nuclear family. Those in non-normative relationships and households are not only excluded from this narrow enactment of the ‘ideal’ public health subject, but are rendered potentially risky disease vectors by virtue of their alternative kinship arrangements. We explore the implications of these findings for the more-than-human relationalities that shape health inequalities and processes of marginalisation during public health crises, and we offer suggestions for public health measures that address the needs of diverse ‘publics’.",Article,1 , Health Sociology Review,Aug 3,0,"

Enduring connections?: Soft power and pedagogy in short-term study tours to Indonesia,['Jemma Purdey'],"Since 2013, the Australian government has funded Australian students to undertake short periods of study abroad with an emphasis on Asia, including Indonesia. Universities, too, have been enhancing their study-abroad options as part of broader internationalization campaigns. In a short time, the number of Australian higher-education students undertaking study abroad as part of their undergraduate degrees has doubled, to one in five students. This significant investment follows from two beliefs: that Australia’s relations with Asia are significantly impacted by people-to people relations; and that formal, experiential learning is a particularly effective pedagogical method. But is this investment warranted? Do periods of short-term study in Indonesia enrich students’ understanding of the region, and of Australia’s relations with Asia? And do current undergraduates, who have unprecedented access to mobility through travel and tourism, gain anything from a formal and guided people-to-people experience? This article explores these questions through an in-depth investigation of the intensive-mode undergraduate unit ‘Australia and Asia’ run by the Faculty of Arts at Monash University from 2014 to 2017. It suggests that, for many students, study tours facilitate a short-term period of emotional involvement and self-reflection, rather than forging enduring connections.",Article,1 ," Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde / Journal of the Humanities and Social Sciences of Southeast Asia and Oceania",Feb 12,0,"

The Aristotelian legislator and political naturalism,['George Duke'],"Aristotle's assertion in Politics 1.2 that there is a natural impulse to form political communities is immediately contraposed with the claim that the person responsible for their foundation is the cause (αἴτιος) of the greatest of goods ( Pol . 1253a33). The attribution of an essential role to the legislator as an efficient cause appears to clash, however, with Aristotle's political naturalism. If the polis exists by nature and humans are by nature political animals (1253a1–2), then the question arises as to why active intervention by the legislator is necessary for a polis . Conversely, if the polis is an artefact of practical reason, then Aristotle's distinction between products of the intellect and natural entities seems to preclude the status of the polis as natural. In light of this apparent tension between different aspects of Aristotle's account of the origins of political communities, the current paper seeks to demonstrate their reconcilability. Section 1 considers the role of the Aristotelian legislator in light of broader Greek assumptions regarding law-making. Section 2 then considers the status of law-making expertise (νομοθετική) as part of political science (πολιτική) and examines the mode of practical reason that is exercised by the legislative founder. Finally, in section 3, and building on recent interpretations which have emphasized that Aristotle operates with an extended teleological conception of nature, I argue that acts of legislative founding and nature can consistently serve as joint causes of the polis , because the ‘products’ of the practical rationality of the architectonic legislator are themselves an expression of distinctly human nature.",Article,1 , The Classical Quarterly,Jan 21,0,"

Conclusion,['George Duke'],"In this book I have attempted to provide a qualified defence of Michael Dummett’s ‘tolerant reductionist’ account of abstract entities. Once we accept Dummett’s thesis that the problem of abstract objects should be decided by considerations derived from the theory of meaning — in particular through an examination of the extent to which it is legitimate to attribute a reference to abstract singular terms — it becomes apparent, or at least so I have argued, that an intermediate position between platonism and nominalism is more plausible than its rivals. The problem with platonism is that it renders our epistemic access to abstract entities inscrutable insofar as it relies on a mysterious and superfluous notion of mind and language independence. Extreme nominalism, by contrast — in denying that it is legitimate to ascribe a reference to abstract singular terms at all — contradicts our capacity to form true sentences containing reference to abstract entities, while more sophisticated variants overlook the role played by our linguistic practice in the constitution of ‘thin’ objects of reference.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Law and development in Nepal: the slow road to judicial reform,['Bidhya Chapagain'],"An independent judiciary capable of delivering fair and equal justice to all is critical to Nepal’s ambition to strengthen public access to justice and increase public confidence in the judicial system. Seventy years of law and development initiatives in Nepal have however had mixed results. Reforms to justice, strengthening democracy and rule of law governance have occurred alongside minimal reforms to the judicial system. In turn, good governance, legal empowerment of the poor and disadvantaged, fair access to justice and increased judicial responsiveness remain serious gaps in Nepal’s reform program. These gaps in justice delivery form part of a larger challenge posed by Nepal’s long history of struggle for rule of law and justice. Embedded structural inequalities and a political culture characterized by strengthened institutional measures ‘at the top’ and unmet demands for justice ‘from the bottom’ congeal the gaps to reform in Nepal. This paper focuses on two major areas: firstly, it stimulates a much needed discussion on law and development in Nepal. That is, how has law and development been explained, understood, and implemented? Secondly, it aims to contribute specifically to the discourse on approaches to judicial reform. Specifically, in relation to Nepal it asks how can judicial reform be operationalized in such a way that public trust in the judicial system as a guarantor of justice can be accomplished. The paper proposes that a concerted and more diligent effort in the area of judicial independence is an urgently required step in this direction.",Conference Paper,,,Nov 25,0,"

Do Police need guns? The nexus between routinely armed police and safety,"['Clare Farmer', 'Richard Evans']","In most parts of the world, the routine arming of police officers is an established and expected norm. A ‘common sense’ rhetoric underpins support for police to be routinely armed. Armed police, it is argued, are inherently protective and improve safety for everyone. However, there is little empirical evidence to demonstrate that jurisdictions which deploy routinely armed police are intrinsically safer, or more effectively uphold the basic human rights of civilians to be safe. This paper acknowledges the work (in this journal) of Osse and Cano, who reported a clear association between fatal shootings by police and homicide rates across 11 jurisdictions. We re-focus their thesis to the specific context of the routine arming of police officers. We compare four jurisdictions – two are routinely armed, two are routinely unarmed – to examine the presumption that routinely arming our police makes the policed community safer. The findings are mixed and, in parts, surprising. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to support the expectation that the routine presence of armed police increases and ensures community safety. Further research is needed, but our findings provide an empirical basis from which to challenge calls to arm police in currently unarmed jurisdictions.",Article,0 , The International Journal of Human Rights,,0,"

Justice and Development: SDG Goal 16: Approach to Achieve Equal Access to Justice for All in Nepal,['Bidhya Chapagain'],"The Constitution of Nepal considers the rule of law and justice as a significant component to realize democracy and development. It is important to ensure citizens' access to justice through justice reform initiatives. Past seventy years ofjustice and development initiatives in Nepal have contributed to reforming justice and strengthening democracy andrule of law, yet the challenges to sustain those efforts are enormous. Justice sector reform initiatives have become important to promote access to justice in order to achieve sustainable development. This will scale-up ""equal access to justice for all"" in line with Sustainable Development Goals (henceforthSDGs). As the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development enters its sixth year of implementation, it is important to see how access to justice is understood and implemented in Nepal. This article discusses Nepal's progress on the global goal for access to justice and rule of law, which is encapsulated in the Goal 16 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and focuses on how justice reform approaches better support achieving the goal. The article claims that while the challenges of achieving the goal are stark, considering the current pace of progress, the instrumental approaches chosen for justice reform is problematic. This article argues Nepal's efforts towards the SDGs and fulfilling its constitutional mandate requires a sharper focus on bridging the gap that exclude people from accessing justice; delivering access to justice for all in line with SDGs is possible through a realistic and participatory 'people-centred approach'.",Article,,,,0,"

Religion and populism: the Aksi 212 movement in Indonesia,"['Ismet Fanany', 'Rebecca Fanany']","Populism and inclusion Populism, as a social and political construct that describes a particular relationship between the public and its leaders, has been observed to involve an understanding of society that positions ordinary people against the smaller group of elite individuals who hold power in the context in question. This relationship is seen as antagonistic, with the public being morally superior (Mudde and Kaltwasser, 2017). In this, it is important to note that populism does not align with a single political philosophy or position, and populist movements have emerged in a range of political contexts (Kaltwasser, 2013), as well as in various geographic locations and historical periods (Gidron and Bonikowski, 2013). For this reason, it is possible to view populism as a vehicle for greater inclusion in the political and social context, a situation that is generally accepted as beneficial for well-being and giving individuals a stake in their community (Taket et al, 2009). It is this aspect of populism that has implications for action in various areas that include community development but also public health, education and politics itself, in which grassroots activities may figure prominently (Aslanidis, 2007). Filc (2010) notes the significance of inclusion and exclusion in populist politics and finds that inclusion and exclusion have three separate types: material, symbolic and political. In this conceptualisation, material inclusion and exclusion relate to policies that provide benefits or support to specific groups within the population, while symbolic inclusion and exclusion derive from political rhetoric that can be altered to create new social understandings. Finally, political inclusion and exclusion have to do with structures in the political environment, such as

What Achilles Did and the Tortoise Wouldn't,['Catherine Legg'],"This paper offers an expressivist account of logical form, arguing that in order to fully understand it one must examine what valid arguments make us do (or: what Achilles does and the Tortoise doesn’t, in Carroll’s famed fable). It introduces Charles Peirce’s distinction between symbols, indices and icons as three different kinds of signification whereby the sign picks out its object by learned convention, by unmediated indication, and by resemblance respectively. It is then argued that logical form is represented by the third, iconic, kind of sign. It is noted that icons uniquely enjoy partial identity between sign and object, and argued that this holds the key to Carroll’s puzzle. Finally, from this examination of sign-types metaphysical morals are drawn: that the traditional foes metaphysical realism and conventionalism constitute a false dichotomy, and that reality contains intriguingly inference-binding structures.

"Searching for diagnostic certainty, governing risk: Patients' ambivalent experiences of medical testing","['Kiran Pienaar', 'Alan Petersen']","Diagnosis is pivotal to medicine's epistemic system: it serves to explain individual symptoms, classify them into recognizable conditions and determine their prognosis and treatment. Medical tests, or investigative procedures for detecting and monitoring disease, play a central role in diagnosis. While testing promises diagnostic certainty or a definitive risk assessment, it often produces uncertainties and new questions which call for yet further tests. In short, testing, regardless of its specific application, is imbued with meaning and emotionally fraught. In this article, we explore individuals' ambivalent experiences of testing as they search for diagnostic certainty, and the anxieties and frustrations of those for whom it remains elusive. Combining insights from sociological work on ambivalence and the biopolitics of health, and drawing on qualitative interviews with Australian healthcare recipients who have undergone testing in the context of clinical practice, we argue that these experiences are explicable in light of the contradictory impulses and tensions associated with what we term ‘bio-subjectification’. We consider the implications of our analysis in light of the development of new tests that produce ever finer delineations between healthy and diseased populations, concluding that their use will likely multiply uncertainties and heighten rather than lessen anxieties.",Article,1 , Sociology of Health & Illness,,0,"

Nostalgic nationalists in South Korea: the flag- carriers' struggles Nostalgic nationalists in South Korea: the flag-carriers' struggles,"['Gil-Soo Han', 'David Ross Hundt']","The 2016-2017 Candlelight Revolution was one of the most significant events in recent South Korean politics, but little attention has been paid to the powerful conservative counter-movement that accompanied and followed the candlelight protests. This counter-movement was symbolized by demonstrations by flag-carriers who found Park Geun-Hye's impeachment and Moon Jae-In's inauguration incomprehensible. They argued that Park was innocent, called for her release from prison, and claimed that Moon's election was illegitimate. An analysis of speeches made during conservative counter-protests between 2016 and 2019 illustrates how these activists reject the values of a new era in South Korean political and economic life. Instead, their speeches conveyed a clear desire to have the legacy of the industrialization generation recognized in contemporary South Korea. These flag-carriers are evidence that a marginalized set of desires and aspirations about South Korean nationalism and identity coexist with the progressive views of the candlelight protesters. The persistence of such an intense and partisan worldview, however, poses a threat to the future of liberal democracy in South Korea. ARTICLE HISTORY",Article,1 , Critical Asian Studies,,0,"

Testing for Life? Regimes of Governance in Diagnosis and Screening,"['Alan Petersen', 'Kiran Pienaar']","Testing—involving the analysis of blood samples or scans, colonoscopies, biopsies, or other procedures—is frequently the front door to healthcare. It often leads to further tests or treatments, perhaps hospitalisation, and sometimes unwelcome news about one’s future. Consequently, being tested is fraught with meaning and is likely to evoke strong emotional responses in those subject to its regimes, including anxiety, fear and uncertainty. In short, however one looks at it, testing is highly consequential and as much a socio-political phenomenon as a medical one. This special issue explores the socio-cultural, politico-economic, policy and regulatory factors shaping the practices of testing in healthcare, and the implications of testing. Before we introduce the articles and the interviews, we begin with some observations on recent trends in the practices of testing and offer a broad perspective on this field, drawing on ideas from science and technology studies (STS) and insights arising from our workshop. The topic of testing in healthcare is not new in sociology and other social sciences, and we acknowledge the various important contributions made by colleagues to date, including investigations of population-based screening and routine diagnostic practices in the clinic, specifically prenatal genetic testing and direct-to-consumer genetic testing (e.g., Armstrong & Eborall, 2012; Hallowell, 1999; Jutel, 2011, 2019; Mol, 2000, 2002; Tutton & Prainsack, 2011).

Using the heuristic method of social research, it examines the place of social activism in the field of criminal justice reform. The paper was presented on the eve of a Victorian State election, where debate about law and order issues predominated, as has occurred in many States and Territories around Australia in recent years. The author calls for a substantial review of the operation and effectiveness of the Australian criminal justice system.",Article,1 , Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology,,0,"

Habits in Perception: A Diachronic Defence of Hyperinferentialism,['Catherine Legg'],"Interesting parallels exist between the inferentialism developed and defended by Robert Brandom, and classical pragmatist Charles Peirce's resolute denial that perceptual 'intuition' should play any role in epistemology. In a 2008 paper I explored this, urging Brandom to 'go for gold' and embrace the hyperinferentialism that he sees as a step too far. But in that paper I relied exclusively on Peirce's anti-Cartesian writings of the 1860s. Here I extend my discussion to Peirce's apparently quite different theory of perception from 1902-3. I argue that despite the apparent differences, Peirce remains a hyperinferentialist, and his view remains an attractive alternative to Brandom's 'merely strong' inferentialism. My argument turns on an examination of how Peirce understands concepts diachronically, as habits of associating certain icons with certain real-world indices. As the icons (in Kantian terms: schemata) are repeatedly used, they transform from pictures to predicates.",Article,,,,0,"

"Knowing Indonesia: Intersections of Self, Discipline and Nation",['Jemma Purdey'],"This is the first book in almost two decades to bring together scholars of Indonesia from the Australian academy in a single volume to reflect on and engage in a deep critique of their field. This is a timely contribution. The importance of Indonesia to Australia has never been more acute and it is essential that we have the tools for interpreting and understanding our nearest neighbour. Investigation of debates within the field of Indonesian studies will help us interpret better the perceptions and politics informing our study. As is befitting the multi-disciplinary nature of Indonesian studies, the book brings together leading political scientists, historians and anthropologists to give their unique perspectives and analysis of this field in the Australian academy and elsewhere in the West. This approach results in some divergent views on the fundamental questions of how Indonesia should be studied and the uses of Indonesia knowledge for activism, and presents new ideas about how we might pursue our work in the future.",Book,,,,0,"

Understanding the structure and composition of co-offending networks in Australia,"['David Bright', 'Chad Whelan']","A large volume of criminal offending involves two or more individuals acting collaboratively. In recent years, much contemporary research on group crime has integrated research on co-offending with the study of criminal networks. However, while this research (mostly from the United States and Canada) is generating significant insights into co-offending, there is a notable absence of research on co-offending and co-offending networks in Australia. This report presents the findings of a study into co-offending using arrest data from Melbourne, Australia. The study sought to extend previous work on co-offending by analysing the range of crime types committed by individuals and co-offenders across co-offending networks.",Book,,,,0,"

Primary Crime Prevention Apps: A Typology and Scoping Review,"['Mark A. Wood', 'Stuart Ross', 'Diana Johns']","In the last decade, an array of smartphone apps have been designed to prevent crime, violence, and abuse. The evidence base of these apps has, however, yet to analyzed systematically. To rectify this, the aims of this review were (1) to establish the extent, range, and nature of research into smartphone apps with a primary crime prevention function; (2) to locate gaps in the primary crime prevention app literature; and (3) to develop a typology of primary crime prevention apps. Employing a scoping review methodology and following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, studies were identified via Web of Science, EBSCOhost, and Google Scholar. We included English-language research published between 2008 and 2020 that examined smartphone applications designed explicitly for primary crime prevention. Sixty-one publications met our criteria for review, out of an initial sample of 151 identified. Our review identified six types of crime prevention app examined in these publications: self-surveillance apps, decision aid apps, child-tracking apps, educational apps, crime-mapping/alert apps, and crime reporting apps. The findings of our review indicate that most of these forms of primary crime prevention apps have yet to be rigorously evaluated and many are not evidence-based in their design. Consequently, our review indicates that recent enthusiasm over primary crime prevention apps is not supported by an adequate evidence base.",Article,1 , Trauma Violence & Abuse,Mar 24,0,"

Los Jaivas: Toward A Decolonial Attitude in Chilean Psychedelic Rock,"['Israel Holas', 'Sergio Holas']","This article proposes a decolonial reading of the rock music produced by Los Jaivas in Chile during the late sixties and early seventies by putting it in dialogue with Rodolfo Kusch's work on identity and Walter Mignolo's notion of decolonial aesthesis. By highlighting Indigenous melodies, rhythms, ideas and experiences in the rock genre, Los Jaivas propose an alternative conception of the Chilean subject as Andean and not exclusively displaced-European, as maintained by Chile's institutions and mainstream culture. The music produced by Los Jaivas articulates a decolonial attitude. It recognises Indigenous values as an integral part of Chilean reality, adding a deeper dimension to the political critique of capitalism that occurred during the Unidad Popular period (1970-1973). Through the enduring music of their first albums and singles, Los Jaivas create an instance of decolonial aesthesis that has profoundly altered Chilean discourses of national identity.",Article,1 , IASPM Journal,,0,"

The Rothbury incident and the police suppression which followed became part of both union folklore and the personal legend of one police officer, William John MacKay, later New South Wales Police Commissioner. This article probes beneath the layers of myth that surround Rothbury and argues that the initial tragedy was largely the result of police incompetence, and that MacKay’s association with the shooting is deeply ironic.

Constant’s liberal theory of popular sovereignty,['George Duke'],"In Principes de Politique (1815), Benjamin Constant offers a blueprint for later liberal attempts to retain a commitment to popular sovereignty, while moderating its absolutist tendencies and associations with arbitrary political power. This paper examines some notable tensions, still relevant today, in Constant’s domesticated liberal concept of popular sovereignty. These tensions, I contend, all point to the conclusion that Constant’s project of limiting popular sovereignty by appeal to a sacrosanct domain of rights rests on a liberal interpretation of the general will, which is in fact constitutive for the enjoyment of individual liberties. Section 2 argues that Constant’s location of popular sovereignty in the legislative general will, as determined by elected representatives, does not overcome the problem of the potential arrogation of the popular will by a partisan minority. Section 3 then examines Constant’s views on rights and the implications of his acknowledgement that the enjoyment of liberties depends upon the institutional guarantee provided by constitutional enactment. Finally, in section 4, I demonstrate that Constant’s valorization of individual self-development is inseparable from an idea of political liberty which reflects the priorities of a liberal elite.",Article,1 , British Journal for the History of Philosophy,Jan 5,0,"

Information Influence: Assessing the Advantage,['Miah Hammond-Errey'],"This research proposed and tested an analytical framework and assessment tool, called information influence to measures changes in the level of strategy-driven, state-sponsored information activities by the timeliness, specificity and targeted nature of communications as well as dissemination tactics of publicly available information. This theoretical innovation is intended to drive computational security studies towards improved (and earlier) identification of information warfare, cyber-attack and covert influence activity across a range of platforms. The information influence assessment tool includes metrics underneath measures of timeliness, specificity, targeting and the level of integration and strategy to discern information influence along with the dissemination tactics applied to publicly available information. This establishes a baseline and can be used to identify changes in the level of strategy driven, state sponsored information activities. The information influence assessment tool is intended to drive computational security studies towards improved (and earlier) identification of information warfare, cyber- attack and covert influence activity across a range of platforms. Additionally, the analytical process could be significantly enhanced by automation of aspects, such as data collation and narrative, sentiment and network analysis. Applying the information influence framework to Russian operations in Crimea, Eastern Ukraine and the downing of MH17 demonstrated that it is a robust and sound framework to assess public information campaigns.

'Uninhibited Play' The political and pragmatic dimensions of intoxication within queer cultures,"['Kane Race', 'Kiran Pienaar', 'Dean A Murphy', 'Toby Lea']","This chapter argues that disinhibition provides a better frame than competing concepts such as 'minority stress' for grasping the significance of the chemical practices of sex and gender minorities. Disinhibition draws attention to the pragmatic, performative dimensions of intoxicant consumption while keeping the material constraints enacted by the stigmatisation of non-normative sexual and gender expression in view. A genealogy of dis/inhibition reveals its affinities with the pathologisation of sexual and gender minorities from the 19th century, enabling us to see how the consumption of intoxicating substances might emerge as part of processes of counter-corporealisation over the ensuing century. Drawing on qualitative research with LGBTQ+ drug and alcohol consumers in Australia, we explore how queer and trans cultures of sex and drug experimentation activate the mode of play and playfulness to engage in practices of queer world-making that counter the material pressures of 'inhibition'.

"A Civilianised Summary Power to Exclude: Perceptual Deterrence, Compliance and Legitimacy",['Clare Farmer'],"As a response to alcohol-related disorderly behaviours, the use of exclusion has expanded steadily across Australian jurisdictions but with minimal analysis of its effects. Bans, from public or private locations, are typically imposed summarily and presumed to be a meaningful deterrent to future problematic behaviours. The formalisation of licensee banning powers has created a civilianised police-enforceable power to punish by exclusion. In Victoria, the legislative framing of licensee barring order provisions precludes formal monitoring of their use. This article reports findings from interviews conducted with recipients. The conceptual and situational value of barring orders are acknowledged, but their capacity to act as a tangible deterrent or effective agent for behaviour change is far from conclusive. Barring orders constitute a civilianised summary power, which currently operates without scrutiny or accountability. Implications for the operational legitimacy of barring powers emerge from this study, in addition to broader considerations with respect to compliance, enforcement, oversight, and the importance of developing and examining alcohol policies through a gendered lens.",Article,1 , International Journal for Crime Justice and Social Democracy,,1,"

The Edge of the Knife: The Paradox of Police Power,"['Richard Evans', 'Clare Farmer']","As is true of power more generally, the power of police is an under-researched and under-theorised aspect of society. Most policing textbooks evade the question of what constitutes police power, instead creating a brief narrative arc, one of rationalist progress from semi-mythologised origins to contemporary legal and administrative structures. The extensive critique of policing in capitalist society from a Marxist perspective, which situates policing as an expression of the violence which is fundamental to capitalism, is acknowledged. However, we criticise as a major weakness the “implied alternative”: a social formation which does not rely on violence or the threat of violence. We argue that all societies are underpinned by violence; that all societies have policing in some form; and that large, complex modern societies require a reasonably professional and disciplined police organisation to function. This is the consequence of the Hobbesian social contract: individual citizens surrender their rights to use violence in return for the protection of the State. The benefits of this arrangement can be explained by borrowing Talcott Parson’s “monetary model” of power. By this view, police power is analogous to a fiscal system: the “power banks” of the State, of which the police are the most important, allow people to use power which is not their own. Like a fiscal system, police power too is dependent on public trust and confidence. This informs the notion of policing by consent, and the doctrine of minimum force which are explored in Chap. 3.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Taking a Pass on Assessment Grades for a Career Focused Tour of the Middle East,"['Mat Hardy', 'Sally Totman']","The Middle East Study Tour (MEST) is a capstone elective unit that stands alone as a credit module towards an undergraduate degree. The tour has the dual purposes of exposing students to the Middle East region's political challenges and better illuminating potential career paths for life after university. But is one student's personal discovery (or their ability to express it in writing) more valuable than another's? Attaching a numerical grade to such endeavours would seem to indicate that. For this reason the MEST uses an 'Ungraded Pass' approach to the assessments. That is, the students pass the assignments (and the module) by submitting their work, but without any score being awarded. This article explains the mechanisms the MEST uses for assessment and how this aligns with the goal of the program to expose students to the real world of political struggles and career development.",Article,1 , Frontiers: The Interdisciplinary Journal of Study Abroad,Dec 15,0,"

Collective bargaining’s contribution to employment skills and transitions: lessons from the Nordic countries,['Andrew Scott'],"Major shifts in employment patterns – across sectors, occupations and regions – are a constant feature of modern labour markets. These transitions can occur in more or less humane and efficient ways, depending on whether active policies are leveraged to support workers, employers and industries to adapt to change and take advantage of new opportunities. The imperative to better manage employment transitions is all the more pressing given the necessary shift towards a carbon-neutral, sustainable economy. The very high collective bargaining coverage in Nordic countries contributes to their active labour market policy, proper regulation of employment standards, high-quality investments in skills and innovation, integrated vocational planning, and comprehensive social solidarity. This article will identify how strong collective bargaining in Nordic countries enhances workforce skills, adaptability and innovation, and the lessons from this to improve the more laissez-faire transitions currently occurring in liberal market economies such as Australia.",Article,1 , Labour & Industry a journal of the social and economic relations of work,Jul 13,0,"

However, the understanding of multi-aquifer fractured bedrock systems and how they respond to episodic wet season rainfall recharge is still limited. This study used a comprehensive suite of isotopic tracers, hydrogeological and near-surface geophysical methods to characterise the multi-layer aquifer system on Milingimbi, a small bedrock island located in the tropics of the Arafura Sea, Northern Australia. Near-surface geophysics was used to determine the subsurface structure of the aquifer, including the spatial extent and thickness of the fresh groundwater lens and the shape of the transition zone. Pore water chloride profiles, hydrochemistry and δ18O and δ2H data supported the geophysics results. The lens was found to be 40 m thick on average, with an up to 70 m thick transition zone underneath. Water level time series data over 4 years showed that there was a strong tidal signal observed in the groundwater wells screened in the deeper aquifer and that the aquifer system showed a dynamic response to the wet season rainfall. Time series chloride and δ18O and δ2H rainfall and production bore data suggest that there was a freshening (i.e. lower salinity input) of the lens as a result of recharge during the wet season, which occurs up to 6 months after the event. Groundwater residence time indicators showed that the mean residence time in the lens was at least 25 years and the rate of recharge to the system was up to 200 mm y⁻¹.

Coping with the 'double bind' through vlogging: Pandemic digital citizenship of Chinese international students,"['Jian Xu', 'Xinyu Zhao']","The article examines the vlogging practices of Chinese international students during the COVID-19 pandemic and their positive roles in coping with the double bind. By doing thematic analysis of the content of vlog videos generated by Chinese international students on both Chinese and English audio-visual platforms, we identify three overarching themes of their vlogging stories: ‘everyday personal experience sharing’, ‘vlogger-generated citizen journalism’ and ‘producing counternarratives’. We argue that Chinese international students creatively practice ‘actualizing digital citizenship’ through dual vlogging. Their vlogging implies a strong sense of civic engagement, connectivity and empowerment, and is conducive to the self-resilience of the affected group as well as their identity and solidarity building in the crisis. Our research advocates for a shift of digital citizenship studies to recognize the flexible, individualized and loosely networked ‘actualizing digital citizenship’ practice. We also call attention to take the everyday digital practices of the international students seriously to understand their concerns, needs and resilience in the uncertain and difficult times in order to better support this vulnerable cohort.",Article,1 , Continuum Journal of Media & Cultural Studies,Nov 27,1,"

Discursive Habits: A Representationalist Re-Reading of Teleosemiotics,['Catherine Legg'],"Enactivism has influentially argued that the traditional intellectualist 'act-content' model of intentionality is insufficient both phenomenologically and naturalistically, and minds are built from world-involving bodily habits-thus, knowledge should be regarded as more of a skilled performance than an informational encoding. Radical enactivists have assumed that this insight must entail non-representationalism concerning at least basic minds. But what if it could be shown that representation is itself a form of skilled performance? I sketch the outline of such an account from the perspective of Peirce's pragmatist semiotics, which theorises signs as habits of associating specific cues with appropriate acts and schemas of ensuing experience. Within this framework, I argue, a naturalistic account of propositional structure can be constructed which transcends the symbolic-and in some instances even the linguistic-sphere, and offers new insights regarding the Information Processing Challenge, and the Hard Problem of Content.",Article,1 , Synthese,Oct 13,0,"

Ethnicity and Violence in Sri Lanka: An Ethnohistorical Narrative,"['Premakumara de Silva', 'Farzana Haniffa', 'Rohan Bastin']","The ethnicity and violence in Sri Lanka have many root causes and consequences that are closely interconnected. Given the nature and the complexity of root causes and consequences of these highly contested concepts, it should not be treated as a part of linear historical processes where one event led to another. Sri Lanka presents case of how intersecting not only ethnicity and violence but also religion, caste, class, linguistic, and cultural mosaics have been and might be billeted within the borders of a nation-state. However, state building in Sri Lanka has been riddled with paradoxes. The curious notion of numerically dominant ethnic group, Sinhala manifesting a ""minority complex"" or anxieties about minority groups, Tamil and Muslims, is evident in the rise of Sinhala Buddhist nationalism during the nineteenth and the twentieth century of the country. Since state building has often meant centralization and a single ethnic group dominating the symbolic framework of the nation, there has been the tendency by minority groups such as Tamil and Muslims who have felt marginalized by the process to reinvent new collective ethnic identities. Moreover, cultural-religious minorities have responded to such hegemonic state-building process through mobilization of both non-violence and violent means. A complicated coming together of anti-minority sentiment at the level of the state, permissive politics that made violence a possibility, and the utilizing of this permissive violent politics for working out various class and caste enmities resulted in an extremely difficult political time for Sri Lanka in the 1980s. However, the central narrative through which the prevalence of violence was understood was the ethnic conflict. This paper too shall lay out the impor

Farewell sweet ladybird: a manifesto and three chronicles by Pedro Lemebel (1952–2015),"['Sergio Holas-Véliz', 'Israel Holas']","Pedro Segundo Mardones Lemebel, known as Pedro Lemebel because he rejected his father’s surname in favour of his mother’s maiden name, was born in El Zanjón de la Aguada in Santiago, one of Chile’s most marginalised urban districts. During the 1970s, while Chile still suffered under the dictatorial rule of General Augusto Pinochet, Lemebel studied to become a school teacher specializing in Fine Arts – the first in his family to do so. After graduating, he worked as a school teacher in a series of schools; however, he was fired from two of his appointments for openly identifying as gay. Between 1987 and 1997, together with Francisco Casas, Lemebel formed the performing arts troupe Las yeguas del apocalipsis1 (The Mares of the Apocalypse), whose name alludes to the idea of the end of an era, specifically: the Chile of pre-1973. This implicit reference to the 1973 Chilean experience is a loaded one, as post-1973 Chile was the testing ground for expansion of the current hegemonic economic logic and practice: neoliberalism. Neoliberal theories were first put into practice in Chile, under experimental shock conditions, as part of Augusto Pinochet’s economic and social policy program, which was heavily influenced by the Chicago School of Economics and its formation of a new wave of Chilean economists through the Universidad Católica de Santiago, known as the ‘Chicago boys’. Lemebel’s work is a reaction against the myths of Chile under neoliberalism. In the 1990s, in the first few years of the transition towards democracy, Chile presents an image of itself as a successful economic miracle, a developed nation without poverty that is only capable of looking forward at the cost of ignoring the ignominy of its recent past.

"A Confrontation on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands: Interviewing, Local Language, and Rapport in Anthropological Fieldwork","['Nicholas Herriman', 'Monika Winarnita']","Researching how the Australian state relates to the Muslim Malay community on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands (an Australian territory), Herriman and Winarnita provide an example of rapport with a potential research participant going wrong. They see this experience as providing insightful and important data. In this example, Herriman is following a suggestion to interview a new participant when, by chance, he meets with Ifti. Ifti immediately accuses Herriman of wishing to do a study that would enrich Herriman, making him a millionaire (after the study had been published as a book). In addition to providing another example that questions the very possibility of rapport, Herriman and Winarnita analyze this “Ifti moment” as an expression of Ifti’s ideology. Namely, Ifti saw Herriman’s government-funded academic research as merely a continuation of the profits and the historical exploitation of Muslim Malays of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the majority of whom are receiving government benefits for unemployment, pensions, and so on.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Book review: Science Fiction and Digital Technologies in Argentine and Brazilian Culture,['Israel Holas'],"Edward King’s Science Fiction and Digital Technologies in Argentine and Brazilian Culture joins the ever-growing tide of English language Science Fiction Studies focusing on Latin American publications. (Within the Spanish speaking world and internationally Science Fiction Studies has for the past few decades established itself as a relevant field of academic inquiry through numerous symposiums, journals and publishing houses specialising in both Science Fiction proper and studies of the genre). Science Fiction and Digital Technologies in Argentine and Brazilian Culture is an ambitious book that engages with, theorises and makes visible the changing political and ideological landscapes of Brazil and Argentina under neoliberalism. King’s book achieves this by engaging with the science fiction literature produced in those countries since the zero point of their respective dictatorships and highlights how that very brutal shift toward the neoliberal social model is reflected and challenged in works from this genre.

Rethinking how Technologies Harm,['Mark A. Wood'],"Understanding how technologies contribute to social harms is a perennial issue, animating debate within and well beyond criminology. This article contributes to these debates in two ways. First, it critically examines five of the key approaches criminologists have used to think through how technologies contribute to harms. Second, it proposes a new approach to understanding ‘technology–harm relations’. Bringing the theory of critical realism, Simondon and Floridi into conversation, the proposed approach offers a stratigraphy of harm that enables us to excavate the different layers of human–technology and technology–harm relations. In doing so, it enables us to distinguish between four technology–harm relations that untangle the socio-technicality of harmful events: instrumental utility harms, generative utility harms, instrumental technicity harms and generative technicity harms.",Article,0 , British Journal of Criminology,,0,"

Disintegrating the Linear: Time in Simon Finn's Instability,['Marilyn Stendera'],"The art of Simon Finn has always had a markedly temporal dynamic. Vast structures built and annihilated again and again across different media, their fragmentation across space and time simultaneously methodical and darkly chaotic. Roiling waters and eldritch surfaces held captive in their unrest. Finn’s works render cycles of construction and disintegration, of stasis and motion, in ways that shed light upon the underlying structures of our experience of time while shattering simplistic notions of linearity. This is nowhere more apparent than in Instability, through which Finn allows us to explore the intertwining of personal and historical time, ancestral memory and radical futurity, artefactual form and temporal function.

Using Social Psychology to Constructively Involve Colleagues in Internal Evaluation,"['Alison Rogers', 'Leanne Kelly', 'Alicia McCoy']","Internal evaluators can lead positive, helpful, promotive interactions among colleagues to make evaluation more appropriate, understandable, and accessible. As the motivations and abilities of non-evaluator colleagues are highly varied, interpersonal skills help facilitate cooperation and promote evaluation. Social interdependence theory from social psychology can assist with understanding teamwork and developing interpersonal competence. While the literature links social interdependence theory with evaluation, there is limited understanding of its application in practice. In this article, we share our internal evaluation experiences in three Australian nonprofit organizations to elucidate how we harnessed social connections and interpersonal dynamics to achieve cooperative goals. The purpose of this article is to share our process for using theory and literature to assist with reflecting, planning, and acting, around the way we interact with colleagues. Evaluators may find this process useful when considering how to personalize professional development around interpersonal competencies for evaluation.",Article,1 , American Journal of Evaluation,Oct 8,0,"

Truth-Telling in Unprecedented Times - ADI Conference (Nov 2021),['Catherine Legg'],"The presentation argues that although pragmatist philosophers such as Rorty have had great success in contending that there is no 'criterion of truth', inferences from this claim to the conclusion that we lack any useful notion of truth have been too hasty. ""Recent world events"" arguably show that truth as an overarching philosophical notion was always more fragile than philosophers imagined it to be. How humanity is to ride out arguably necessary 'epistemic trust-busting' (Steven Fuller's term) in institutions of higher learning, whilst maintaining sufficient workable human trust in science to keep body and soul together, is suggested as a key question of our age, to which an 'epistemology as praxis' is offered as one modest solution.",Conference Paper,,,,0,"

In particular, we focus on narrative devices and discursive strategies that reveal the locus of enunciation from which the Zapatistas, via Marcos, speak. This Word emerges from, and is situated at, the interstices of Western and Mayan worlds. In the Zapatista stories this is evident through a transmodern use of intertextuality; the critique of “false language” and the eruption of an-other grammar; and a dynamic authorial performance that shifts between Marcos-el Sup as narrator vis-à-vis Marcos as author, spokesperson, and Subcomandante of the EZLN.",Article,0 , Journal of Iberian and Latin American Studies,Oct 27,0,"

Investigating the impact of a Clinical Pharmacist on the Health Outcomes of Paediatric Patients,"['Kelvin Robertson', 'Therese Kairuz', 'Niechole Robinson[...]', 'Aaron Drovandi']","Background/Aims: Recent fiscal scrutiny and changes in health care financing have necessitated that health care providers justify a clinical and economical basis for their involvement in patient care. Although clinical pharmacists have been shown to enhance patient health outcomes and reduce costs among adult patients, the impact of a pharmacist in paediatric patient care has not been extensively documented. Methods: A team of pharmacists was established to conduct a systematic review of the literature. A title scan of papers in 5 databases was performed by 14 pharmacists using the MeSH terms Pharmacists, Medical Intervention, Paediatrics and Cost-Benefit Analysis. The underpinning research question was: “How do the professional activities of a clinical pharmacist impact the health outcomes of paediatric in-patients?” The abstracts of suitable titles were scanned and articles were read to assess relevance. Relevant articles were then evaluated independently by at least two members of the team, using critical appraisal tools suitable for quantitative, qualitative or systematic review studies. Results: The initial search identified 327 citations which after full text review and application of the scoring tool, resulted in 10 studies included in the systematic review. The average number of interventions reported varied from study to study. Dosing recommendations, pharmacokinetics and drug allergy alerts were the most commonly recorded interventions by pharmacists for a paediatric population. Evidence from this review will be used to formulate improvements to in-patient paediatric care. Conclusion: Clinical pharmacists have a positive impact on inpatient paediatric care which included both health and economic benefits.",Conference Paper,,,Jan 9,0,"

Anthropology and #MeToo: Reimagining fieldwork,"['Tanya King', 'David Boarder Giles', 'Mythily Meher', 'Hannah Gould']","#MeToo deals in the everyday ambiguous and intersectional, providing a space for discussion of the grey areas of sexual propriety. Since 2017, when the term was mobilised spectacularly in the US entertainment industry, other industries have undertaken an examination of their own practices and norms. In this paper we consider the implications of this political moment for the discipline of anthropology, and specifically the idea of ‘the field’ in the context of anthropological training in Australia. We argue that fieldwork is tacitly, and sometimes explicitly, fetishised by anthropologists as a transformative domain in which the normative rules of gendered interaction are temporarily suspended in favour of fruitfully engaging informants. Drawing on Bourdieu, we argue that ‘the field’ (the methodological and symbolic space) is a ‘field’ (a domain of recognition) that junior anthropologists enter with the expectation that they will suffer as a necessary part of their initiation, placing some PhD students at an enhanced risk of sexual violence. We reflect on the attitude of anthropologists to fieldwork as part of a professional illusio, a belief in the value of ‘playing the game’ that limits our capacity to modify our methodology to make it safer for neophytes and to reimagine a more just discipline.",Article,0 , The Australian Journal of Anthropology,,0,"

I argue that McDowell's advice that the philosophical picture of 'rules as rails' must be abandoned is not sufficient on its own to fully appreciate mathematics' unique blend of creativity and rigor. Rather, we need to understand how Peirce counterposes to the brute compulsion of 'Secondness', both the spontaneity of 'Firstness' and also the rational intelligibility of 'Thirdness'. This is a written version of a presentation I gave at the “Peirce’s Mathematics” conference, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, November 25-27, 2015, which was organized by Professor Fernando Zalamea.

Keeping them connectedreducing drug-related harm in Australian schools from a Catholic perspective,['Peter Norden'],"In this Harm Reduction Digest, Father Peter Norden of Jesuit Social Services (Australia) summarises the findings of a report of a consultation into how Catholic schools in Australia address substance use by school students. The report showed that while in the past the 'zero tolerance' approach had been the norm, more recently there had been a growing awareness in Catholic schools that it is possible to respond to the needs of drug-using students while being respectful of the duty of care to other students. Moreover, harm reduction was accepted as a serious objective for drug policy and practice in Australian Catholic schools. The paper canvases the key issues that emerged from the consultation and suggests what 'good practice' looks like, providing useful guidance for both Catholic and non-Catholic schools alike. For those of us outside the Catholic school system, the paper provides an enlightening read about how substance use can be best addressed within schools.

Mental health in the commercial fishing industry: Modern uncertainties and traditional risks,"['Tanya King', 'Rachel Turner', 'Vincent Versace[...]', 'Susan Brumby']","Commercial fishers face a range of stressors that impact physical and mental health. However, there is limited research on the level of mental ill‐health among fishers and on the nature of stressors that contribute to their psychological distress. This paper focuses on the experiences of commercial wild‐catch fishers and analyses the results of an Australian national survey conducted in 2017 (n = 872) (Appendix S1). We first assess underlying themes in perceived stressors, identifying three distinct categories termed ‘traditional risks’, ‘modern uncertainties’ and ‘future concerns’. Second, we assess the level of self‐reported psychological distress, demonstrating higher occurrence of high to very high psychological distress among commercial fishers in comparison with the national population. Third, we examine the relationship between different groups of stressors and psychological distress, finding that stronger perceptions of both ‘traditional risks’ and ‘modern uncertainties’ are associated with greater levels of psychological distress among fishers. Third, recognizing diversity within the industry, we examine differences in these relationships among skippers and crew (work role), and inshore versus offshore fishers (fishing location). Our analysis demonstrates that ‘traditional risks’ and ‘modern uncertainties’ differentially impact on fisher mental health and depend on the individual's role in the industry and their fishing location. The findings suggest that changes to factors associated with modern uncertainty stressors—including government management techniques, red tape, media representation and political support—could significantly improve mental health in the commercial fishing sector.",Article,1 , Fish and Fisheries,,0,"

Digital Family Ethnography: Lessons from Fieldwork amongst Indonesians in Australia,['Monika Winarnita'],"This article discusses the opportunities and constraints in using a digital family ethnography for qualitative studies amongst Indonesians in Australia. The first half of the article highlights the opportunities that online and offline participant observation can provide in terms of understanding family transnational networks. Going beyond an ego-based narrative approach in interviews, digital family ethnography shows how social network analysis and reflexivity can bring depth to a study on family by including the researcher’s position vis-à-vis the research participants. The second half of the article discusses challenges in using these combined online and offline methods and how these challenges might be mitigated in future studies. In particular, the article look at problems faced with interviews, multimedia usage, and social media analysis related to the researcher’s background and in working with different age groups. In the transnational family context, social media and electronic communication are critical parts of contemporary ethnographic methodologies, and the discussion thus centres on including online personhood in the research. The study concludes that although digital family ethnography methodologies have limitations, they can be used to account for the transforming relationships that make up family mobility.",Article,,,,0,"

Injecting as a sexual practice: Cultural formations of ‘slamsex’,"['Kane Race', 'Dean A Murphy', 'Kiran Pienaar', 'Toby Lea']","‘Slamsex’ has emerged in gay vernacular in recent years to denote a particular way of taking drugs and a particular kind of sex. Slamming refers in this context to the practice of injecting drugs – typically crystal methamphetamine – intravenously. To pair ‘slamming’ with ‘sex’ is to propose that a particular mode of drug administration is constitutive of a particular kind of sex – a relatively novel idea that deserves some unpacking. What does it mean to make a route of drug administration definitional in the delineation of a sexual practice? What does this move reveal about contemporary practices of sex and drug consumption? In this article, we explore these questions with reference to theories of drug effects and practitioners’ accounts of slamsex. We conclude by considering the implications of our analysis for slamsex relations and associated harm reduction measures.",Article,1 , Sexualities,,0,"

Building a humanitarian sector career: understanding the education vs experience tension,"['Matthew Clarke', 'Sophie Perreard', 'Phil Connors']","Each year over the last decade, there were on average 400 humanitarian disasters or emergencies, killing more than 100,000 people and affecting a further 200 million. Such humanitarian events require immediate responses as well as effective longer-term activities to aid communities recover. The global response is now valued over US$27 billion annually. More than half a million people are estimated to work in this sector, the majority being locally engaged staff. The international community provides significant resources to assist local communities impacted by these humanitarian emergencies. This aid flows through multiple channels, including national and regional governments, international non-governmental organisations and local community based organisations. Increasing the skills and knowledge of leaders and managers of these responses is a critical need to ensure the most effective recovery in communities as well as use of resources. Understanding the professional journey in the humanitarian sector is vital, but currently limited. As the humanitarian sector continues to expand, greater focus on the skill-set needed by humanitarian workers responding to these events is needed. However, tensions exist between the primacy given to the experiences and soft-skills of humanitarian workers over the value of academic qualifications. This paper provides some suggestions how this tension within the humanitarian sector may be addressed and reconciled. This paper presents new data based on interviews with 20 humanitarian professionals from a range of humanitarian aid agencies and considers their experiences and reflections on building a career within the humanitarian sector.",Article,9 , Third World Quarterly,,0,"

The Use of Digital Platforms for Adults’ and Adolescents’ Physical Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic (Our Life at Home): Survey Study (Preprint),"['Kate Parker', 'Riaz Uddin', 'Nicola Ridgers[...]', 'Lauren Arundell']","BACKGROUND Government responses to managing the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted the way individuals were able to engage in physical activity. Digital platforms are a promising way to support physical activity levels and may have provided an alternative for people to maintain their activity while at home. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to examine associations between the use of digital platforms and adherence to the physical activity guidelines among Australian adults and adolescents during the COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions in April and May 2020. METHODS A national online survey was distributed in May 2020. Participants included 1188 adults (mean age 37.4 years, SD 15.1; 980/1188, 82.5% female) and 963 adolescents (mean age 16.2 years, SD 1.2; 685/963, 71.1% female). Participants reported demographic characteristics, use of digital platforms for physical activity over the previous month, and adherence to moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and muscle-strengthening exercise (MSE) guidelines. Multilevel logistic regression models examined differences in guideline adherence between those who used digital platforms (ie, users) to support their physical activity compared to those who did not (ie, nonusers). RESULTS Digital platforms include streaming services for exercise (eg, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook); subscriber fitness programs, via an app or online (eg, Centr and MyFitnessPal); facilitated online live or recorded classes, via platforms such as Zoom (eg, dance, sport training, and fitness class); sport- or activity-specific apps designed by sporting organizations for participants to keep up their skills (eg, TeamBuildr); active electronic games (eg, Xbox Kinect); and/or online or digital training or racing platforms (eg, Zwift, FullGaz, and Rouvy). Overall, 39.5% (469/1188) of adults and 26.5% (255/963) of adolescents reported using digital platforms for physical activity. Among adults, MVPA (odds ratio [OR] 2.0, 95% CI 1.5-2.7), MSE (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.5-4.5), and combined (OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.0-3.8) guideline adherence were higher among digital platform users relative to nonusers. Adolescents’ MVPA (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.3), MSE (OR 3.1, 95% CI 2.1-4.4), and combined (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.1-9.0) guideline adherence were also higher among users of digital platforms relative to nonusers. CONCLUSIONS Digital platform users were more likely than nonusers to meet MVPA and MSE guidelines during the COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions in April and May 2020. Digital platforms may play a critical role in helping to support physical activity engagement when access to facilities or opportunities for physical activity outside the home are restricted.",Preprint,,,,0,"

Meanwhile, there has been little consideration of how evaluation expectations affect small-sized development NGOs. Small NGOs contend with several challenges including limited staff skill-pools, stretched time, and insufficient funding. This paper investigates evaluative practices in 20 small development NGOs to examine how they check effectiveness, improve their programmes, and remain accountable to donors and intended beneficiaries in ways that are meaningful and useful to them.

Drugs as technologies of the self: Enhancement and transformation in LGBTQ cultures,"['Kiran Pienaar', 'Dean A Murphy', 'Kane Race', 'Toby Lea']","The consumption of drugs has long been a mainstay of urban queer cultures and it is well-recognised that complex connections exist between sexual minoritisation and desires to chemically alter bodily experience. Yet despite evidence that rates of consumption are higher among LGBTQ populations, research exploring the gen-dered and sexual dynamics of these forms of consumption is limited and tends to frame such consumption as a response to stigma, marginalisation and discrimination. Against this dominant explanatory frame, this article explores the diverse experiences of LGBTQ consumers, and in so doing highlights both the pleasures and benefits of consumption, as well as potential risks and harms. Contributing to the growing body of ontopolitically oriented research that treats the materiality of drugs as emergent and contingent, we trace the ontologies of drugs, sexuality and gender that LGBTQ subjects generate through specific practices of consumption. Our analysis draws on qualitative interviews with 42 self-identified LGBTQ people from an Australian study designed to explore how sexual and gender-diverse minorities pursue particular drug effects to enhance or transform their experience of gender and/or sexuality. Our participants' accounts illuminate how drug consumption materialises in relation to sex, desire and play where it enhances pleasure, facilitates transgression and increases endurance. In the context of gender variance, our findings suggest that drug use can transform gendered experience and enable the expression of non-normative gender identities, in the process challenging gender binarism. By considering the productive role of drugs in enacting queer identities, this article treats drugs as 'technologies of the self' (Foucault 1988) and explores how drug consumption, sex and gender shape each other across a range of settings. We conclude by reflecting on the implications of our findings for research and service provision, and suggest ways of engaging LGBTQ consumers in terms that address their diverse priorities and experiences.",Article,0 , The International journal on drug policy,,0,"

Adolescents’ MVPA (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.3), MSE (OR 3.1, 95% CI 2.1-4.4), and combined (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.1-9.0)guideline adherence were also higher among users of digital platforms relative to nonusers. Conclusions: Digital platform users were more likely than nonusers to meet MVPA and MSE guidelines during the COVID-19stay-at-home restrictions in April and May 2020. Digital platforms may play a critical role in helping to support physical activity engagement when access to facilities or opportunities for physical activity outside the home are restricted.",Article,1 , Journal of Medical Internet Research,,1,"

Enacting Productive Dialogue: Addressing the Challenge that Non-Human Cognition Poses to Collaborations Between Enactivism and Heideggerian Phenomenology,['Marilyn Stendera'],"This chapter uses one particular proposal for interdisciplinary collaboration – in this case, between early Heideggerian phenomenology and enactivist cognitive science – as an example of how such partnerships may confront and negotiate tensions between the perspectives they bring together. The discussion begins by summarising some of the intersections that render Heideggerian and enactivist thought promising interlocutors for each other. It then moves on to explore how Heideggerian enactivism could respond to the challenge of reconciling the significant differences in the ways that each discourse seeks to apply the structures it claims to uncover.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Elected and Non-elected Representative Claim-Makers in Indonesia,['Michael Hatherell'],"This chapter explores the place of Bali’s security organisations within the broader context of political representation in contemporary Indonesia. With a theoretical perspective that focuses on emerging practices and forms of discourse as representative claims and repertoires, we can map out some of the ideas and themes presented by both elected and non-elected representative claim-makers. This chapter draws on a wide range of evidence, including interview transcripts and publicly available evidence of claim-making. It highlights some of the key trends in claim-making by both elected and non-elected leaders in Indonesia and contextualises some of the claims made by Bali’s security organisations. Overall, the chapter notes tension between the institutional power of political parties and their ideational weakness, and argues that consequently a vacuum is now being filled with a diverse range of claims by both elected and non-elected representative claim-makers.",Chapter,,,,0,"

Analyzing interviews with 37 young people in Australia using Irwin and Michael’s account of science–society relations and Warner’s conceptualization of “publics,” we explore the processes by which they assess the credibility of online sexual health information. We suggest that when seeking medical information, young people opt for traditionally authoritative online sources that purport to offer “facts.” By contrast, when seeking information about relationships or sexual practices, participants indicated a preference for websites presenting “experiences” rather than or as well as “facts.” Regardless of content, however, our participants approached online sexual health information skeptically and used various techniques to appraise its quality and trustworthiness. We argue that these young people are productively understood as a skeptical public of sexual health. We conclude by exploring the implications of our analysis for the provision of online sexual health information.",Article,1 , Qualitative Health Research,Apr 25,0,"

Knowing Indonesia Inside and Out: Herb Feith and the Intellectual Search for Understanding,['Jemma Purdey'],"Herb Feith was one of Australia's first and most prominent scholars of Indonesia. His books and articles dating from the late 1950s are still read by students of Indonesian politics today, and his opinion on Indonesia's future was sought until the day he died by people both in Australia and in Indonesia. He was also among the first to teach peace studies in Australian universities and is remembered for his activism on human rights, peace, and environmental issues as well as his scholarship. Jemma Purdey is researching and writing a biography of Herb Feith with particular focus on his engagement with Indonesia, both as scholar and humanist. This article endeavours to open up one of the areas explored in the biography, the relationship between the ‘foreign’ scholar and his subject, Indonesia. How does the initial point of engagement with Indonesia impact on the scholars’ way of ‘knowing’ it?

Independent separate legal representation for rape complainants in adversarial systems: lessons from Northern Ireland,"['Mary Iliadis', 'OLIVIA SMITH', 'JONATHAN DOAK']","In March 2018, Northern Ireland was divided by the acquittal of four men for rape, attempted rape, exposure, and perverting the court of justice in what became known as the ‘Belfast Rugby Rape Trial’. The case resulted in considerable debate about the ill‐treatment of rape complainants and prompted the Gillen Review into the Laws and Procedures in Serious Sexual Offences. Gillen proposed the introduction of separate legal representation (SLR) to safeguard complainants’ sexual history and medical records pre‐trial. Since the Review was published, however, scepticism about the applicability of complainant SLR within an adversarial context remains. We examine the arguments for and against SLR in adversarial systems and propose a ‘Gillen‐plus’ framework for SLR that would not interfere with the accused's rights or public interest and could provide the basis for reform across other adversarial jurisdictions. We question whether Northern Ireland's unique socio‐political context strengthens or weakens the justifications for introducing SLR.",Article,1 , Journal of Law and Society,,0,"

Discursive Habits: Peirce and Cognitive Semiotics,['Catherine Legg'],"Enactivism has greatly benefitted contemporary philosophy by demonstrating that the traditional intellectualist ‘act-content’ model of intentionality is simply insufficient, and showing how minds may be built from world-involving bodily habits. Many enactivists have assumed that this must entail non-representationalism concerning at least basic minds. Here I argue that such anti-intellectualism is overly constraining,and not necessary. I sketch an alternative enactivism which draws on Peirce’s pragmatic semiotics, and understands signs as habits whose connections with rich schemas of possible experience render them subject to increasing degrees of self-control. The talk’s key innovation is to align this cyclical process of habit cultivation with Peirce’s representationalist icon-index-symbol distinction, in a manner which I explain. The talk was delivered to the International Centre for Enactivism and Cognitive Semiotics, March 2021, organised and hosted by Claudio Paolucci (Bologna).",Presentation,,,Mar 2,0,"

"Problematising LGBTIQ drug use, governing sexuality and gender: A critical analysis of LGBTIQ health policy in Australia","['Kiran Pienaar', 'Dean A Murphy', 'Kane Race', 'Toby Lea']","It is well-established that a high prevalence of substance use is found in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ) populations; a finding that researchers attribute to the stigmatised status of non-normative sexual and gender expression, and the role of illicit drug use in the collective production of socio-sexual pleasures, expressivity and disclosure in LGBTIQ communities. Despite the connections between sexual experimentation and substance use, LGBTIQ consumption practices have rarely received the attention they deserve within the alcohol and other drug (AOD) field. In this paper, we draw on concepts from post-structuralist policy analysis to analyse how AOD consumption among sexual and gender minorities is constituted in the policies of three Australian LGBTIQ health organisations. Following Carol Bacchi's (2009, p. xi) observation that we are ""governed through problematisations rather than policies"", we consider how substance use in LGBTIQ populations has been formulated as a policy problem requiring intervention. Doing so allows us to identify the normative assumptions about minority sexual and gender identities that underpin dominant problematisations of LGBTIQ substance use. These include: a) high rates of AOD use in LGBTIQ populations constitute problems in and of themselves, regardless of individual patterns of use; b) LGBTIQ people are a vulnerable population with specialised needs; and c) sexualised drug use is associated with ""disinhibition"" and a range of risks (including HIV transmission, drug dependence and mental health issues). Addressing the implications of these assumptions for how LGBTIQ communities are governed, we suggest that problematisation is

A properly pragmatist pragmatics: Peircean reflections on the distinction between semantics and pragmatics,['Catherine Legg'],"Although most contemporary philosophers of language hold that semantics and pragmatics require separate study, there is surprisingly little agreement on where exactly the line should be drawn between these two areas, and why. In this paper I suggest that this lack of clarity is at least partly caused by a certain historical obfuscation of the roots of the founding three-way distinction between syntax, semantics and pragmatics in Charles Peirce’s pragmatist philosophy of language. I then argue for recovering and revisiting these original roots, taking indexicality as a case-study of how certain questions connected with the distinction which are currently considered complex and difficult may be clarified by a ‘properly pragmatist pragmatics’. Such a view, I shall argue, upends a certain priority usually accorded to semantics over pragmatics, teaching that we do not work out what terms mean in some abstract overall sense and then work out to what use they are being put; rather, we must understand to what use terms are being put in order to understand what they mean.",Article,0 , Pragmatics and Cognition,,0,"

She had been brutally murdered. Who was she, and who killed her, become Australia's great unsolved crime for decades. The body was preserved in formalin, her image circulated around the world. The mystery fascinated the nation and, for some, became an obsession. Ten years later, the body was identified and a man was convicted of her manslaughter. The case, it seemed, was neatlty solved. But this 'solution', advanced by police, accepted by the courts and the media, and since repeated endlessly, was a lie. Behind the lie is a troubling story of murder and obsession, of a wild conspiracy theory, of police corruption and a miscarriage of justice, and of a real killing which floated free from reality and became a myth. <br /",Book,,,,0,"

Police Practice and Research An International Journal A new methodology for strategic assessment of transnational threats,"['Miah Hammond-Errey', 'Kate Ray']","Transnational threats including organised crime and terrorism pose serious physical and national security concerns, and have significant economic and social costs. Despite these widely recognised harms, there is limited literature on using strategic intelligence resources to understand and assess transnational threats to enable action to reduce them. Whilst there is growing consensus that national security and national law enforcement intelligence challenges are moving closer together-especially in relation to transnational threats-there is very little theory or practitioner guidance. This article presents an applied national law enforcement case study; the provision of strategic intelligence assessments to senior decision-makers of the Australian Federal Police intended to improve decision-making. During this case study, practitioners drew on national security intelligence approaches and analytical techniques to produce strategic assessments of transnational threats. The case study addressed challenges raised in the literature as obstacles to effective strategic intelligence, including ambiguity relating to the role of intelligence in the criminal environment, a broad range of divergent threat types and the need to demonstrate value of strategic intelligence for decision-makers. This has broader applicability in different jurisdictions and on different topics due to the focus on consultation , engagement and collaboration alongside traditional intelligence processes. Given the lack of literature in the field, it makes a contribution to understanding and developing best practice in strategic intelligence as applicable to national policing and security.

Alternative National Narratives in Indonesia,"['Michael Hatherell', 'Alistair Welsh']","In this chapter we turn from the two dominant national narratives in Indonesia to consider other potential sources of storytelling about Indonesia as a nation. In the first part of the chapter we turn to Islam and the power of Indonesia’s dominant religion to shape political ideas about the past, present and future of the nation. We argue that Islam provides potential powerful forms of storytelling, but also faces limitations in providing an alternative national narrative in its own right. In the second half of the chapter we turn to ideas about democracy, human rights and inequality, and consider the potential for these different sets of ideas to shape the overall Indonesian national narrative. Importantly, we note that while the dominant national narratives imagine Indonesians as all possessing a similar purpose, differences and inequalities in society mean that this is not necessarily the case, and there is the potential for challenges to the dominant national narratives on this basis.",Chapter,,,,0,"

"Do patron bans act as a deterrent to future anti-social offending? An analysis of banning and offending data from Victoria, Australia","['Ashlee Curtis', 'Clare Farmer', 'Travis Harries[...]', 'Peter G Miller']","Police-imposed patron bans seek to reduce alcohol-related harm in and around licensed premises. This study examined the offending records of people who received bans and explored whether anti-social offences reduced after the imposition of a police-imposed ban. A de-identified dataset was obtained from Victoria Police, comprising persons who received police-imposed bans in one Australian city between 2010 and 2017. Analyses were conducted to examine charging histories and offence types before and after receipt of the ban. Of those who received bans, 70.7% had recorded offences before the ban. The median number of charges before and after receiving a ban were not significantly different with respect to both anti-social behaviours and other behaviours. However, when examining short term effects (two years prior and post receiving a ban), there was a significant increase in anti-social offending, specifically public order offences (d = 0.67), after receiving a ban compared to before. Most of the ban recipients had an established record of anti-social behaviours. As a short-term sanction which limits access to specific locations, Victoria’s police-imposed bans do not appear to deter recipients from repeat offending or change already established patterns of anti-social behaviours. Consideration should be given to extending the permissible length of bans and to ensuring more effective enforcement. In addition, alternative interventions or diversions for those with a record of anti-social offending, which could be initiated on-the-spot, may be more effective in reducing undesirable behaviours in and around licensed premises.",Article,1 , Policing and Society,,0,"

The Struggle for the National Narrative in Indonesia,"['Michael Hatherell', 'Alistair Welsh']","This book offers a unique analysis of how political representatives construct ideas about the nation in contemporary Indonesian politics. In their struggle to define what the authors call the ‘national narrative’, would-be national leaders seek to develop a story about the nation’s past, present and future. These stories feature a unique plot, set of characters, and a moral that the political narrator hopes will resonate. In contemporary Indonesia, the authors assess two prominent national narratives: the technocratic and populist national narratives. The book concludes with an analysis that considers other potential sources of ideas about the nation, as well as the potential implications for domestic politics and Indonesian grand strategy. Dr Michael Hatherell is a Senior Lecturer in Strategic Studies at Deakin University, Australia. He works as the Academic Director for Deakin in its relationship with the Australian Defence College. Michael’s research interests mainly focus on the role of narrative and ideas in shaping political competition, foreign policy and grand strategy.

Pulmonary benign metastasizing leiomyoma: A case report,"['Malik H Khan', 'Annum Faisal', 'Hussain Ibrahim[...]', 'Glenn M.

Rarely, it has benign extra-uterine growth patterns, including benign metastasizing leiomyoma (BML), with lungs being the most common metastatic site. We present a case of a 47-year-old female who, 3 years prior to presentation, underwent abdominal supra-cervical hysterectomy for benign leiomyoma. Approximately 6 months prior to presentation, she was seen for shortness of breath and chest pain. A CT of the chest revealed multiple new non-calcified pulmonary nodules bilaterally. PET/CT demonstrated mild FDG uptake in multiple lung nodules, with no significant extra-thoracic sites of abnormal FDG uptake. A CT guided lung biopsy showed a low grade, smooth muscle tumor. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for smooth-muscle actin and desmin, estrogen and progesterone receptor and was negative for CD117, HMB-45, CD34, pan cytokeratin and EMA. She underwent wedge resection of one of the nodules which confirmed the above findings. A cytogenetic analysis was also performed, which was consistent with pulmonary BML. She ultimately underwent left lower lobe resection and was started on a daily aromatase inhibitor. BML is a rare disease usually seen in women of reproductive age. The pathogenesis and treatment remain controversial. BML mostly tends to have an indolent course and a favorable outcome.",Article,8 , Respiratory Medicine Case Reports,,1,"

"3D printing, policing and crime","['Angela Daly', 'Monique Mann', 'Peter Squires', 'Reece Walters']","This article examines the implications of advanced manufacturing technology, more commonly known as three dimensional (3D) printing, for policing and crime, notably the dissemination of digital design files and the use of 3D printers to produce illicit firearms. The application and rapid evolution of 3D printing technology has created new challenges for law and regulation, and represents an interesting security paradox, albeit one which until now has received scant attention in the criminological or policing literature. On the one hand, 3D printing denotes a significant shift in the creation and use of objects, ranging from food to body parts, and more controversially, weaponry. On the other hand, the use of this technology to create items such as firearms and weapons signifies a potential safety, security, and legal challenge. We explore the emergence of 3D printing and its use to create firearms along with the theoretical challenges to legal design and enforcement presented by this decentralised technology. We also present some empirical data on instances of 3D printed firearms and firearm parts being detected internationally, and some jurisdictions’ legal and policy responses. We conclude by considering that any regulation of 3D printed firearms must be based on a robust evidence base and take proper account of citizens’ rights, but also that any national regulation will be in tension with the transnational and decentralised nature of the technology.",Article,0 , Policing and Society,,0,"

"Do Police Need Guns?, Policing and Firearms: Past, Present and Future","['Richard Evans', 'Clare Farmer']","This book challenges what are, for many people, deep-rooted expectations regarding the routine arming of police and compares jurisdictions in which police are routinely armed (Toronto, Canada and Brisbane, Australia) and those where police are not routinely armed (Manchester, England and Auckland, New Zealand). With a focus on Western jurisdictions and by examining a range of documentary, media and data sources, this book provides an evidence-based examination of the question: Do police really need guns? This book first provides detailed insight into the armed policing tradition and perceptions/expectations with respect to police and firearms. A range of theoretical concepts regarding policing, state power and the use of force is applied to an examination of what makes the police powerful. This is set against the minimum force tradition, which is typified by policing in England and Wales. Consideration is also given to the role played by key tropes and constructs of popular culture. Drawing on Surette’s model of symbolic reality, the book considers contrasting media traditions and the positioning of firearms within narrative arcs, especially the role of heroes. The book concludes by drawing together the key themes and findings, and considering the viability of retaining and/or moving towards non-routinely armed police.",Article,,,,0,"

Policing's ‘meme strategy’: understanding the rise of police social media engagement work,['Mark A.

Provoked by changes to Facebook's News Feed Algorithm, this self-described ‘meme-strategy’ generated a surge of new followers for the organisation’s social media accounts, with NSW Police's Facebook page reaching one million followers in August 2017 – a record for an official police Facebook page. This article examines the social media logics underpinning NSW Police's ‘meme strategy’ and similar police PR strategies that have employed humour and cute content to increase social media engagement. Through analysing the content and ‘active’ engagement metrics of NSW Police's ‘meme strategy’, in this article I critically examine this approach to police public relations, focusing in particular on its weaponisation of cute content to generate engagement. NSW Police's meme strategy, I argue, exemplifies what we might term social media ‘engagement work’: strategies intended to increase the reach of police messaging on social media and promote horizontal engagement spillover and vertical legitimacy spillover.",Article,9 , Current Issues in Criminal Justice,May 26,1,"

The Limits of Sympathy: International Feminists and the Chinese 'Slave Girl' Campaigns of the 1920s and 1930s,['Sarah Paddle'],"In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content: The Limits of Sympathy: International Feminists and the Chinese 'slave girl' Campaigns of the 1920s and 1930s Sarah Paddle - Deakin University (Australia) The focus of this study is one of the important campaigns of Western feminism over China , the campaign over the slave girls of China . The image of the silent, suffering and childlike figure became the image and symbol of Chinese womanhood for the West. Set alongside the emerging figure of the modern Western girl, healthy, active and independent, the Chinese slave girl remains silenced, mute, passive and childlike, linked in the Western archives to a traditional culture and the practices of antiquity. Women's organisations engaged in both Britain and Australia in the inter-war period refined and sustained a traditionalist feminist and maternalist paradigm of care for the mothers and children of China . This feminism employed an essentialist and colonialist project without a concern for cultural difference. At another level, as this paper will argue, some Western feminist groups and individuals, particularly those on the ground, articulated a different feminism, more internationalist and racially aware. This article studies these shifts in the work of Western feminist activists in and around mainland China in the1920s and 1930s. Western women were 'thinking with interest and sympathy of the women of the East', wrote the British activist Edith Pye on her return from China in 1928. Western feminists were interested in China in the in the inter-war period, and they were sympathetic towards the modern Chinese woman and the Chinese girl. This paper also seeks to critique such notions of sympathy. In traditional Chinese society

As policy language it has permeated public and social policy discourses and become the preferred government language for community service delivery. Much of the capacity building discourse has been driven by governments that are keen to build active citizenship through participation and engagement and provide resources to this end but are reluctant to allow community ownership of those same resources (Craig, 2007).",Chapter,,,,0,"

"Migration, Identity and Wellbeing in Melbourne Australia - The Idea of being Greek in Diaspora","['Maria-Irini Avgoulas', 'Rebecca Fanany']","Both maintenance and transmission of Greek cultural identity are central to people of Greek descent living in diaspora, regardless of whether the individuals involved are immigrants or the descendants of immigrants. The ‘idea of being Greek’ often represents a positive resource for personal and group identity, even though what constitutes being Greek may be different depending on the cultural lens through which it is viewed in the experience of each generation. Nonetheless, core domains associated with the concept of being Greek include the Greek language, the Greek Orthodox religion and various daily cultural practices. This paper will discuss findings across a number of recent studies undertaken in Melbourne, Australia taking an emic and etic perspective that all utilize the emergent methodology of narrative ethnography to explore migration, identity and wellbeing in the Greek community as well as the idea of being Greek in diaspora. The results suggest that there are emotional benefits associated with cultural identity and overall positive wellbeing and that, for those living in diaspora, whether migration was planned or not, a cultural community, cultural activities and membership in a distinct group are positive resources in fostering social connectedness. From a social perspective on health, this extends beyond the physiological/clinical elements of health and wellbeing and emphasizes the various social and intangible benefits of positive outlook and the very significant role that culture, and cultural practices play in the group social context by contributing to the perception of health and wellbeing in the Greek diaspora community across generations.

‘The footage is decisive’: Applying the thinking of Marshall McLuhan to CCTV and police misconduct,['Richard Evans'],"This article adapts Marshall McLuhan’s writings on mass media to ubiquitous and universal surveillance systems, looking at surveillance as media. The term ‘broadcast media’ is derived from an agricultural metaphor, a technique of planting. I argue that CCTV systems are an inversion of broadcasting: ‘harvest media’. Drawing on three case studies in which CCTV has been relevant to allegations of police misconduct, I explore how harvest media impacts on cultural and legal perceptions of evidence, and what can be known.",Article,5 , Surveillance & Society,,0,"

Acting from the Virtue of Caring in Nursing,['Hooft van Stan'],"The author challenges the recently argued position of Helga Kuhse that caring is merely a preparatory stage to moral action and that impartial, principled thinking is required to make action moral, by suggesting a notion of caring as virtue. If caring is a virtue then acting from that virtue will be acting well. Acting from the virtue of caring involves eight features, which include not only that of being sensitive to, and concerned about, the patient, but also that of being aware of, and sensitive to, the relevant ethical principles. In this way, caring is seen as an overarching quality that gives action its moral character. The moral character of an action does not derive only from its having been performed in the light of principles.",Literature Review,9 , Nursing Ethics,,0,"

Suffering and the goals of medicine,['Hooft van Stan'],"Taking as its starting point a recent statement of the Goals of Medicine published by the Hastings Centre, this paper argues against the dualistic distinction between pain and suffering. It uses an Aristotelian conception of the person to suggest that malady, pain, and disablement are objective forms of suffering not dependent upon any state of consciousness of the victim. As a result, medicine effectively relieves suffering when it cures malady and relieves pain. There is no medical mission to confront the spiritual condition of the patient.",Article,8 , Medicine Health Care and Philosophy,Sep 2,0,"

Waste Crime and the Global Transference of Hazardous Substances: A Southern Green Perspective,"['Reece Walters', 'Maria Angeles Fuentes Loureiro']","The production of global solid waste has reached an all-time high with over two billion tons discarded each year—much of it burned, illegally dumped at sea, or buried in unregulated landfills (The World Bank 2019). The United Nations Environment Assembly has declared the current waste problem a “global crisis” (Parker 2019), with estimates predicting that the present rate will worsen threefold by 2050 based on existing consumption and disposal rates (Ellis 2018). The international community has responded with expanding laws and regulations that seek to ensure that waste is disposed of in safe, sustainable and renewable ways. Such measures, however, have increased the costs of disposal and have inadvertently enlarged illegal markets in dumping and transference (European Commission 2019). This article examines the ways in which transnational corporations have avoided the rising costs of lawful disposal by shipping their waste to poor countries in the Global South—often with devastating social and environmental impacts. This article draws on world systems theory (Wallerstein 2004) and political ecology (Bedford et al. 2019; Forsyth 2008) in order to embellish discourses in green criminology and southern criminology (Brisman et al. 2018; Carrington et al. 2018; Goyes 2019) and to examine critically the contemporary social and environmental harms generated by the illegal transference of solid and hazardous waste.",Article,,,,0,"

"‘It’s a Gendered Issue, 100 Per Cent’: How Tough Bail Laws Entrench Gender and Racial Inequality and Social Disadvantage","['Emma Russell', 'Bree Carlton', 'Danielle Tyson']","Women’s rates of remand, or pre-trial detention, have grown dramatically in Australia and the rates at which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are incarcerated without conviction are particularly high. However, there is little research examining bail and remand practices and their relationship to social inequalities. This article presents findings from research on the drivers behind women’s increasing rates of custodial remand in Victoria—a jurisdiction that has significantly restricted access to bail through legislative reforms. Drawing on data derived from interviews with criminal defence and duty lawyers, we outline how bail and remand practices systematically disadvantage women experiencing housing insecurity and domestic and family violence (DFV), increasing their risk of becoming trapped in longer-term cycles of incarceration. Our analysis reinforces the need to move away from ‘tough on crime’ approaches to bail. It also highlights unintended consequences of DFV reforms, including further marginalising and punishing criminalised women who are victim-survivors.",Article,1 , International Journal for Crime Justice and Social Democracy,,0,"

The Aristotelian Spoudaios as Ethical Exemplar in Finnis's Natural Law Theory,['George Duke'],"One provocative but frequently overlooked feature of John Finnis’s natural law theory is its appeal to the normative role of the Aristotelian spoudaios (the mature person of practical reasonableness). Finnis’s account of the basic requirements of practical reasonableness and defense of the methodological device of “focal meaning” both have recourse to Aristotle’s claim that, in ethics and politics, things should be judged in terms of how they appear to the mature practically reasonable person. The current paper examines the normative role played by the spoudaios within Finnis’s natural law theory and provides a defense of that role against the objection that it lacks justificatory force because it is dependent upon circular reasoning. Section one contextualizes Finnis’s use of the spoudaios by considering its Aristotelian origins and also sketches some reasons for its demise in subsequent moral theory. This serves as the basis for an assessment in section two of whether Finnis’s employment of the spoudaios as an ethical exemplar conflates explanation and justification, and therefore culminates in decisionism. The conclusion of the paper is that Finnis’s recourse to the spoudaios is not viciously circular, because it is grounded in the reflexive and dialogical mode of justification proper to ethical enquiry.",Article,3 , The American journal of jurisprudence,,0,"

‘The Law of the Instrument’: Examining the Nexus Between Safety and the Routine Arming of Police Officers,"['Richard Evans', 'Clare Farmer']","This chapter builds on the historical, theoretical and conceptual discussions of previous chapters, and presents the findings of our comparative examination of community safety, police officer safety, and the routine arming of police officers. We explore how safety, a complex construct, can be usefully measured, and then compare in detail the four chosen jurisdictions. Using publicly available data, published documents and media sources, we analyse patterns of crime, behaviour and risk, and explore the relationship between the routine arming of police officers, community and police officer safety. Precise causal relationships are difficult to establish with certainty. Our analysis is framed within a “positive effect” construct. The armed tradition of policing is underpinned by the assertion that the routine arming of police enables and ensures both community and police officer safety (see Chap. 4). If this assertion is correct, then in jurisdictions where police officers are routinely armed, the occurrence and rates of key categories of crime will be lower than in jurisdictions whose police are deployed without routinely carrying firearms, as will key measures of police officer safety. We also explore the idea of the “law of the instrument”: the proposition that the availability of a particular response increases the likelihood that it will be used, even in situations where other solutions are more appropriate. This principle would predict that routinely armed police are more likely to use firearms in situations where such use is not absolutely essential, even though all four jurisdictions have clear expectations of minimum-force policing (see Chap. 3). We conclude that the claimed benefits of the armed tradition of policing—a safer community pr

Looking to Sweden in order to Reconstruct Australia,['Andrew Scott'],"The most prominent interest in the 'Swedish model' in Australian political history came after a high-level union delegation visit in 1986 produced a major report titled Australia Reconstructed, which had the nominal endorsement of the Labor Government then in office. However, at this very time, the characteristics of the Swedish policy approach which were most admired by the visiting Australian unionists were undergoing important changes, to which they paid little attention but which critics from the Right strongly emphasized in response. The Australian labour movement interest in Sweden in the 1980s had some distinctive features. It focused on manufacturing industry and skills training policy, reflecting priorities of the main participating unionists. It was also particularly concerned with industrial democracy and work design, as a result of important earlier links between Swedish, Norwegian and Australian industrial relations scholars and practitioners which were forged from the late 1960s. Increased interest in Sweden partly arose from the search for a new political vision by particular elements of the Australian Left following their disillusionment with the Soviet Union after the 1968 Prague Spring. This article presents the results of interviews with participants and extensive archival research to provide new information and perspective on Scandinavian influences on the Australian labour movement; and the political background of the main people involved. It also analyzes how discussion of the 'Swedish model' receded in Australia following the economic setbacks of the early 1990s amid a perception that 'the model' had collapsed, but how policy interest in the continuing evident achievements of Sweden and the other Nordic nations

The Concrete-Abstract Distinction,['George Duke'],"Dummett’s early critique of nominalism is seriously compromised by his renunciation of the thesis that the context principle is sufficient to guarantee reference for abstract singular terms. Once he has abandoned a strong reading of the context principle, in fact, Dummett’s strategy to derive answers to traditional epistemological and metaphysical problems through the theory of meaning appears to be placed in question. By acknowledging that the identification of an extralinguistic referent is an essential component of the determination of the truth-conditions of a sentence containing a singular term, Dummett is led to ascribe a privileged status to the model of meaning for concrete singular terms and to place a greater emphasis on the problem of our epistemological access to concrete particulars. The question of the extent to which it is possible to provide an account of identifying knowledge of abstract objects modelled on the case of concrete objects, moreover, raises difficult questions concerning the metaphysical problem of the distinction between concrete and abstract entities. In this section I will explore these themes in the context of David Lewis’ account of the four ‘ways’ in which we can maintain the concrete abstract distinction.",Chapter,,,,0,"

"Truth, Trust, Verification and Validation in Academic Communication: the challenges of online/social media communication","['Philip David Marshall', 'Sally Totman']","Academic communication, at least in its formal written form, has been built on a long and strong history of systems of validation and verification since about the seventeenth century and the development of the European (Western) Enlightenment. This paper investigates the contemporary challenges that online communication and culture has to this longer and relatively stable structure of how academic knowledge has been constructed. Online communication has produced a culture of information instability, transformed professional and personal identity and a new insecurity in trust and verification. At the same time, online culture and communication has also produced an incredible and unparalleled system of shared information. Through a close study of the gap between online communication and the exigencies of academic communication, the paper attempts to provide a pathway for the contemporary academy to make this new system of communication contribute effectively and with major scholar moderation to new generations of knowledge.",Article,,,,0,"

The use of digital platforms for adults’ and adolescents’ physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic: The Our Life at Home study (Preprint),"['Kate Parker', 'Riaz Uddin', 'Nicola Ridgers[...]', 'Lauren Arundell']","Background: Government responses to managing the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted the way individuals were able to engage in physical activity. Digital platforms are a promising way to support physical activity levels and may have provided an alternative for people to maintain their activity while at home. Objective: This study aimed to examine associations between use of digital platforms and adherence to the physical activity guidelines among Australian adults and adolescents during April/May COVID-19 'stay at home' restrictions. Methods: A national online survey was distributed in May 2020. Participants (adults: n=1,188, 82% female, mean age=37.4±15.1 years; adolescents: n=963, 71% female, mean age=16.2±1.2 years) reported demographic characteristics, use of digital platforms for physical activity over the previous month, and adherence to moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity and muscle strengthening guidelines. Multilevel logistic regression models examined differences in guideline adherence between those who used digital platforms (users) to support their physical activity compared to those who did not (non-users). Results: Overall, 39% of adults and 26% of adolescents reported using digital platforms for physical activity. Among adults, moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (OR=2.0, 95%CI 1.5-2.7), muscle strengthening (OR=3.3, 95%CI 2.5-4.5), and combined (OR=2.7, 95%CI 2.0-3.8) guideline adherence were higher among digital platform users relative to non-users. Adolescents' moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (OR=2.4, 95%CI 1.3-4.3), muscle strengthening (OR=3.1, 95%CI 2.1-4.4) and combined (OR=4.3, 95%CI 2.1-9.0) guideline adherence were also higher among users of digital platforms re

Perceptions of police training needs in cyber-crime,"['Diarmaid Harkin', 'Chad Whelan']","A common observation in the literature on cyber-crime policing is the need for more training. However, there is little detail of who within the police organisation requires training and what type of training may be needed. Based on survey and interview data from three specialist cyber-crime units in Australia, this paper identifies that 'lack of training' is likely to have distinct meanings for different groups within the police: (a) frontline officers; (b) higher management; (c) generalist investigators; and (d) specialist investigators and civilians in cyber-crime units. Each of these groups are likely to face unique training needs that undermines the overall effectiveness of police organisations to respond to cyber-crime. The paper explores the perceived training requirements across each of these groups and some potential ways they can be addressed in an effort to stimulate further research in this area focusing on the differentiated internal needs of police organisations.",Article,1 , International Journal of Police Science and Management,Jul 26,1,"

"When Good Dictators Go Bad: Examining the ""Transformation"" of Colonel Gaddafi.","['Sally Totman', 'Mat Hardy']","On October 20, 2011, the 42 year rule of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi came to a violent end after months of intense and brutal fighting. The violence in which Gaddafi died and the ensuing abuse of his dead body by his killers was captured on film and broadcast around the world. This gruesome end was the antithesis to his rise to power in 1969, where he was welcomed as a savior and a hero. Until his death, Gaddafi was the longest-serving non-monarchical Head of State and was considered by most scholars more likely to die of natural causes than be overthrown by his people. So what happened in those 42 years that caused Gaddafi to go from beloved liberator to hated oppressor? And what is his lasting legacy for the country he ruled for over four decades?",Article,5 , The International Journal of Interdisciplinary Cultural Studies,,0,"

"Caring, objectivity and justice: An integrative view",['Hooft van Stan'],"The argument of this article is framed by a debate between the principle of humanity and the principle of justice. Whereas the principle of humanity requires us to care about others and to want to help them meet their vital needs, and so to be partial towards those others, the principle of justice requires us to consider their needs without the intrusion of our subjective interests or emotions so that we can act with impartiality. I argue that a deep form of caring lies behind both approaches and so unites them. In the course of the argument, I reject Michael Slote's sentimentalist form of an ethics of care, and expound Thomas Nagel's moral theory, which seems to lie at the opposite end of a spectrum ranging from moral sentiments to impersonal objectivity. Nevertheless, Nagel's theory of normative realism provides unexpected support for the thesis that a deep and subjective form of caring lies at the base of even our most objective moral reasons.",Literature Review,1 , Nursing Ethics,,0,"
