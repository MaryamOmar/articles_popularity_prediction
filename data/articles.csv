Myths about Myths? A Commentary on Thomas (2020) and the Question of Jury Rape Myth Acceptance,"['Ellen Daly', 'Olivia Smith', 'Hannah Bows[...]', 'Dominic Willmott']","This commentary responds to claims that research by Cheryl Thomas 'shows' no problem with rape myths in English and Welsh juries. We critique the claim on the basis of ambiguous survey design, a false distinction between 'real' jurors and other research participants, the conflation of attitudes in relation to abstract versus applied rape myths, and misleading interpretation of the data. Ultimately, we call for a balanced appraisal of individual studies by contextualising them against the wider literature.",Article,2021, Journal of Gender-Based Violence,6d ago,1,"

A direct observation of pain scale use in five video-recorded palliative care consultations: Using conversation analysis to show how practitioners support patients to describe pain,"['Laura Jenkins', 'Ruth H Parry', 'Christina Faull']","Objective Assessing pain intensity is an important palliative care task. Self-report pain intensity scales are frequently used within assessment. In contrast to formal studies of validity and reliability, we examine administration of, and responses to these scales in everyday palliative care. Methods We searched episodes of pain scale use in a dataset of (video/audio-recorded) UK palliative care consultations involving five doctors, 37 terminally ill patients and their companions. We found five, and applied the techniques and tools of conversation analysis to characterise scales’ administration and functioning. Results Generally, the patients responded to scales by reporting multiple aspects of pain; the doctors supported and encouraged this. In two episodes, the scales generated misunderstandings. The doctors worked to resolve these in ways that avoided implying the patient was at fault. Conclusion Pain intensity scales can yield richer information than just intensity. They can also generate misunderstandings and social friction which take skill and effort to resolve. Practice Implications Patients tend to respond to pain intensity scales by reporting on multiple aspects of pain, professionals should support them in this. These scales sometimes generate misunderstandings. To preserve the therapeutic relationship, professionals should work to resolve these without implying the patient is to blame.",Article,2021, Patient Education and Counseling,Oct 28,0,"

The Cold Truth: Art as Fulcrum for Recovery in Participants and for Civic Change,['Eloise Malone'],"This article describes art curating with sexually exploited young people. It reviews The Cold Truth: an exhibition produced by CSE survivors at Radiant Gallery, Plymouth, UK, 2016. The article proposes that the quality of the art produced by young people can catalyse social and civic change through public engagement and service commissioner adoption; and a pathway to psychosocial recovery for participants. It examines the transformative power of the art object created during the intervention. The article draws on Frogett et al’s “Aesthetic Third” to propose artwork as a fulcrum between silenced children, and communities which avoid unpalatable truths. It proposes that artworks eliciting empathetic responses are more powerful than those stimulating sympathetic responses. It offers Matarasso’s indicators of great art as language to consider the quality of art created by children, and to advocate that service leaders and commissioners use quality art processes to design and deliver effective services.",Article,2017, Journal of Social Work Practice,Oct 25,0,"

Dispositional Mindfulness Reduces Burnout and Promotes Flourishing in Medical Students: a Two-Wave Latent Change Score Model,"['Denisse Zúñiga', 'Manuel Torres-Sahli', 'Attilio Rigotti[...]', 'Marcela Bitran']","Objectives Many studies document the high prevalence of burnout among medical students. This syndrome may lead to depression, suicidal ideation, and increased academic dropout. However, there is a scarcity of evidence-based interventions to prevent it. The aim of this longitudinal study was to identify factors that may reduce students’ burnout and foster their well-being, and upon which effective interventions can be developed.MethodsA total of 1,117 medical students from eight Chilean universities were asked to complete a set of validated scales in 2015 and 2 years later, in 2017. The measures included distress, burnout, positive mental health, academic engagement, and dispositional mindfulness. Using logistic regressions and a two-wave latent change score model, the predictive power of these variables on burnout and flourishing (an optimal state of mental health) was studied, as well as their covariance across time.ResultsIn total, 639 (57.2%) students answered the questionnaires in T1 and T2; 54.4% reported burnout in T1 and 56.2% in T2. Levels of dispositional mindfulness (the ability to pay attention to one’s sensations, thoughts, and emotions in everyday life) predicted lower probabilities of burning out at 2 years, whereas having experienced burnout in T1 doubled these odds. Dispositional mindfulness, academic engagement, and flourishing at T1 predicted greater odds of flourishing 2 years later, while depression decreased these odds.Conclusions Dispositional mindfulness was the most powerful predictive factor of students’ burnout and flourishing. As dispositional mindfulness can be nurtured through practice, incorporating mindfulness training into undergraduate medical programs may help reduce burnout a

Realtalk Evidence-Based Communication Training: Development of a Conversation Analysis-Based Intervention Designed to be Delivered by Clinical Trainers,"['Ruth H Parry', 'Becky Whittaker', 'Marco Pino[...]', 'Christina Faull']","BACKGROUND Communication skills training for professionals caring for people with life-limiting conditions is in demand. Evidence shows that transfer of skills into practice is limited. Training can be improved by building on in-depth evidence and reflecting the complexity of actual interactions. Scientific advances from direct observational ‘conversation analytic’ studies of conversations in healthcare and beyond provide this evidence, but the linguistic complexities are often inaccessible to clinical trainers. We address this dilemma via a novel training initiative, ‘RealTalk’, designed to support trainers by increasing the authenticity and evidence base of end-of-life communication training for health and social care staff and trainees. METHODS We conducted a development study to create a communication intervention for testing. In collaboration with stakeholders, we identified the rationale for the content and mode of delivery, converted research findings into an applied intervention, and tested and refined the intervention prior to launching the finished product. RESULTS Using a conversation analytic approach, we made and analysed video recordings of real-life palliative care consultations in a large UK hospice. We transformed our findings into preliminary training resources comprising clips from the video recordings and accompanying written materials. We shared the materials with an advisory group of clinicians, educators and researchers. Based on feedback, we modified the materials. Trainers in UK higher education institutions, healthcare organisations and independent hospices piloted our materials within their own training and fed back. Further modifications followed in readiness for evaluation of acceptability, usability and effects

Does the platform matter? Social media and COVID-19 conspiracy theory beliefs in 17 countries,"['Yannis Theocharis', 'Ana Cardenal', 'Soyeon Jin[...]', 'Václav Štětka']","While the role of social media in the spread of conspiracy theories has received much attention, a key deficit in previous research is the lack of distinction between different types of platforms. This study places the role of social media affordances in facilitating the spread of conspiracy beliefs at the center of its enquiry. We examine the relationship between platform use and conspiracy theory beliefs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Relying on the concept of technological affordances, we theorize that variation across key features make some platforms more fertile places for conspiracy beliefs than others. Using data from a crossnational dataset based on a two-wave online survey conducted in 17 countries before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we show that Twitter has a negative effect on conspiracy beliefs—as opposed to all other platforms under examination which are found to have a positive effect.",Article,2021, New Media & Society,Oct 10,1,"

The Moral Career of a Suspected Legionary: Psychological Language in the Securitate Archives,"['Cristina Plamadeala', 'Cristian Tileaga']","This article explores some notable uses of psychological language in the Securitate archives. We examine Securitate files concerning Constantin Vaman, a suspected legionary subjected to surveillance work by the Securitate. This article seeks to show how Securitate activities, particularly the writing of informer notes and operatives’ reports, are the upshot of strategic use of morally implicative psychological language. Constantin Vaman’s Securitate files are used to explore two categories of psychological language: the language of mental states and the language of disposition and motive. We show that Securitate’s writing of informer notes and operatives’ reports were dependent on the strategic use of morally implicative psychological descriptions. We argue that close attention to the many facets of psychological language used in Securitate documents discussed in this article may enable researchers to understand more fully the complex nature and inner workings of surveillance work.",Article,2021, East European Politics & Societies,Oct 8,0,"

P66 Translation and validation of the swahili warwick edinburgh mental wellbeing scale (WEMWBS) and distribution of mental wellbeing in adolescents and adults taking part in the Girls’ Education Challenge project in Tanzania,"['Louise Banham', 'Elizabeth Bruno-McClung', 'Deus Kapinga[...]', 'Rebecca Willans']","Background The Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) is validated for measuring mental wellbeing in UK populations aged 11+ and has been translated into 30+ languages. The primary aim of this study was to translate and validate WEMWBS for use in Swahili-speaking populations. This will facilitate measurement and understanding of wellbeing in these populations, evaluation of policy and practice, and enable international comparisons. The secondary aim was to describe mental wellbeing in the participants of the Girls’ Education Challenge (GEC) project in Tanzania, run by CAMFED and funded through the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. Specifically, to examine sociodemographic characteristics associated with higher and lower wellbeing in this population. Methods We created a short questionnaire including WEMWBS and similar scales for comparison, socio-demographic information and self-reported health. This was translated into Swahili using gold standard methodology. We aimed to use this tool to collect data from secondary school students (girls and boys), learner guides, teacher mentors and teachers taking part in the GEC programme in Tanzania. Quantitative data analysis examined internal consistency of WEMWBS, correlation with comparator scales and confirmatory factor analysis. Qualitative work to assess acceptability and comprehensibility of WEMWBS and conceptual understanding of mental wellbeing was carried out through focus groups with GEC participants.

Childcare Use and Its Role in Indigenous Child Development: Evidence from the Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children in Australia,"['Francisco Azpitarte', 'Abraham Chigavazira', 'Guyonne Kalb[...]', 'Stephen R Zubrick']","We investigate patterns of childcare use and its influence on the cognitive development of Indigenous children. The influence of childcare on Indigenous children's cognitive outcomes is less well understood than for non‐Indigenous children due to a lack of appropriate data. We focus on a cohort of Indigenous children in Australia who have been followed from infancy and for whom rich information on childcare use and cognitive outcomes is observed. Compared to Indigenous children who never participated in childcare, Indigenous children who participated in childcare performed better on several early cognitive outcomes. Using regression and propensity score matching, we show that this difference is driven by selection into childcare, with children from more advantaged families being more likely to attend formal childcare. However, matching analysis results suggest that relatively disadvantaged children might benefit more from attending childcare, as indicated by the positive estimated effects found for those who never attended childcare.",Article,2018, Economic Record,,0,"

Correlates of hair cortisol concentrations in disadvantaged young children,"['Julian Guy Simmons', 'Francisco Azpitarte', 'Fatou Diallo Roost[...]', 'Nick Haslam']","Children from highly disadvantaged families tend to experience worse health, educational, and job outcomes than less disadvantaged peers. However, the mechanisms underlying these relationships remain to be explicated. In particular, few studies have investigated the relationships between the psychosocial influences that children are exposed to early in life, and longer‐term cortisol output. This study aims to contribute to the literature by exploring how disadvantaged young children's experiences of family adversity, and parenting and family functioning, are related to their long‐term cortisol levels. A sample of 60 children (26 males, M age=4.25 years, SD=1.68) and their mothers (M age=34.18 years, SD=7.11) from a low income population took part in a single assessment. Mothers completed questionnaires on the family environment, parenting practices, and child behavior. Children provided a hair sample for cortisol assay, and anthropometric measures. A parsimonious multivariate regression model (including potential predictors identified by a selection algorithm) was used to investigate the correlates of hair cortisol concentration (HCC) in children. Higher levels of social exclusion, being male, and younger age were each associated with higher HCC. Maternal nurturing and emotion coaching were associated with lower HCC. Findings suggest that chronic stress may underlie relationships between adversity and its long‐term effects, and that HCC offers a promising method for examining chronic stress in children and evaluating interventions by which it can be ameliorated.",Article,2019, Stress and Health,,0,"

Barriers and Factors Affecting E-commerce Utilization of Thai Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in Food and Beverage and Retail Services,"['Yot Amornkitvikai', 'Siew Yean Tham', 'Jiraporn Tangpoolcharoen']","E-commerce is deemed as the next potential source of growth for Thailand, but small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are still behind in their utilization of e-commerce. This article uses the decision-makers, technological, organizational and environmental (DTOE) framework to examine the key e-commerce barriers and determinants in e-commerce utilization by Thai SMEs based on a survey of retail and food and beverage (F&B) service establishments in metropolitan Bangkok. This study aims to fill the research gap by examining the types of barriers that hinder e-commerce utilization by Thai SMEs in the F&B and retail services, as well as their key determinants. Unlike e-commerce adoption, e-commerce utilization can capture the full range of e-commerce engagement. The survey’s findings indicate that organizational barriers significantly inhibit e-commerce utilization. Estimations from the structural equation modelling (SEM) show that exports, e-commerce tools, government support, and internal and external e-commerce platforms can enhance e-commerce utilization. In addition, business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce can increase the exports of Thai SMEs, while older entrepreneurs and SMEs tend to neglect e-commerce. Evidence-based policy implications and suggestions are also discussed in this study to enhance e-commerce utilization for Thai SMEs.",Article,2021, Global Business Review,Aug 30,0,"

Public libraries as reserves of cultural and digital capital: Addressing inequality through digitalization,"['Adrián Leguina', 'Sabina In Mihelj', 'John Downey']","Public libraries are among key sites for the acquisition of cultural capital, and possibly one of the most potent means through which the state can address inequality. While digitalization of public libraries already attracted significant scholarly attention, the evidence of its contribution to the acquisition of cultural skills and knowledge and social mobility remains limited, as does the conceptual understanding of links between digitalization, cultural capital, and social stratification. This article draws on two disconnected bodies of research, the sociological analysis of cultural capital and stratification and research on digital divides. To bridge these two bodies of research, the interplay of cultural and digital capital in public libraries was investigated. The extensive dataset from the UK Taking Part Survey (2016–17) was analyzed using two-step cluster analysis and multinomial regression models to explore the contrasting profiles of contemporary library users. Results identify four distinct user groups: Traditional, Active, Family, and Tech Access, which possess different degrees of cultural and digital capital, have different demographic profiles, and benefit from digitalized libraries in different ways. If libraries are to fulfil their role in reducing social inequalities, it is important that they tailor their digital services to the specific characteristics of each user group. This approach also provides a useful template for exploring the interplay of digitalization and (in)equality in other cultural institutions.",Article,2021, Library & Information Science Research,Aug 5,1,"

From occupational to existential class: How to analyze class structure in hybrid societies (The case of Serbia),"['Predrag Cveticanin', 'Inga Tomić-Koludrović', 'Mirko Petric[...]', 'Adrián Leguina']","In this article, we propose a model to analyze the class structure of hybrid post‐socialist societies in South‐East Europe (SEE), using the case of Serbia. We argue that, in such hybrid societies, social inequalities are generated by several mechanisms of similar strength: exploitative market mechanisms (based on economic capital) and different types of social closure mechanisms (based on political and social capital). Their influences are intertwined and cannot be analytically isolated or reduced to a common foundation. Therefore, occupational class analysis in these societies can have only limited explanatory power. In an attempt to overcome these challenges, we were forced to modify the instruments of several established approaches to class analysis. These modifications included (1) a reconceptualization of Bourdieusian notions of political, social, and cultural capital, (2) a different operationalization of social space, (3) identification of specific mechanisms of generating social inequalities, (4) paying attention to both practical and discursive classifications of lifestyles in the establishment of symbolic boundaries, and (5) relying on differential association analysis for identifying class boundaries. Our analysis's final result is a model that enables studying general social inequality, that is, generalized social advantage/disadvantage, in SEE post‐socialist societies.",Article,2021, British Journal of Sociology,Aug 3,0,"

Does a Crisis Change News Habits?

Based on the classical concept of ‘need for orientation’ and the literature on the role of the media in times of crisis, we investigate to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic affected news consumption in comparative perspective. Based on a two-wave panel survey in 17 mostly European countries, our study targets the role of both legacy news brands (TV, radio, newspapers) and so-called contemporary news media (Internet-based and social media) during this global health crisis. Our results show an overall rise of news use across countries, but only for some types of news media. We find an increase of TV news consumption, and a higher reliance on social media and the Internet for news and information. This indicates that in times of crises and an unusually strong need for orientation, people mainly turn to news sources that are easily available and offer a more immediate coverage. Furthermore, we find the rise in news use to be mainly present among those who already have a higher level of trust in legacy media and among people that were more concerned about the impact of the pandemic.",Article,2021, Digital Journalism,Aug 1,0,"

Analysing data from a large seven country survey of Internet use and adapting concepts and methods developed by Bourdieu, we show that there are distinct clusters of users who use the Internet in diverse ways to solve everyday problems, such as buying a mobile phone or diagnosing an illness. Such everyday problem-solving is dependent upon degrees of economic, social, digital and cultural capital, and varies across countries. A comparative methodological strategy combined the use of multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and for the first time in the field, multiple factor analysis for contingency tables (MFACTs). Extending the work of Bourdieu and the sociology of class more generally, we argue that digital capital functions as a bridging capital aiding the convertibility of other forms of capital to the benefit of already advantaged groups.",Article,2021, New Media & Society,Jul 29,1,"

Rethinking social capital in the desistance process: The ‘Artful Dodger’ complex,['Christopher Kay'],"Social capital has become a core component of our understanding of desistance in recent years. Some of this work, however, seems to present social capital as inherently positive, suggesting that increasing stocks in social capital is fundamental to the desistance process. Knowledge surrounding exactly how social capital is utilized within the desistance process, with the exception of acquiring social capital as a social good, remains underexplored. Through an analysis of the desistance narratives of young adult men serving community orders under the supervision of the probation service in England and Wales, this article argues that, instead of being considered to be inherently good, social capital is perhaps better thought of as value neutral, consisting of both positive and negative aspects (some of which occur simultaneously). Desistance, then, is not simply about obtaining social capital (because many people with convictions possess stocks of social capital that supported their offending); rather it is about reorienting the type of capital available to them at any given time, from relationships that imbue ‘anti-social capital’ to those that imbue ‘pro-social capital’. This distinction has significant theoretical and policy interventions, arguing that it is pro-social capital that the literature makes reference to in terms of supporting desistance efforts. The article concludes by offering some tentative suggestions for future research, along with ways in which this distinction can further support how we operationalize desistance within criminal justice policy and practice.",Article,2020, European Journal of Criminology,Jul 21,0,"

The impact of policy change on prisoner resettlement and community integration: A case of disproportionate response,['Christopher Kay'],"The involvement of prisoners on license in the recent London Bridge and Streatham, London attacks have triggered a series of policies aiming to restrict community release. These aim to address not only the point at which prisoners in England and Wales are released, but also the level of engagement prisoners can have with the community before release. They have been introduced with little consultation of the available evidence and, seemingly, with little consideration of those who will be directly impacted as a result of their implementation. This commentary considers how announced changes in policy relating to the use of Release on Temporary Licence (ROTL) with prisoners, represent a response which is not only disproportionate to the scale of the problem but may also negatively impact upon prisoner rehabilitation. It draws upon evidence surrounding the impact of early release and evidence surrounding the practices which work to promote desistance from crime to highlight the flaws in these new policies, but also the importance of maintaining community engagement in the rehabilitation of people with convictions.",Article,2020, Critical Social Policy,,0,"

Rethinking recovery and desistance processes: developing a social identity model of transition,"['Christopher Kay', 'Mark Monaghan']","Background: In recent years, the role of social identity (or identities which are developed through involvement in social groups with others), has received increasing attention in relation to recovery from substance abuse disorders. However, it is also widely noted that the transformation of one’s social identitie(s) is vital for the cessation of other, non-addictive behaviours, such as offending. Interestingly, the discussion of the role of social identity tansformation in relation to both desistance and recovery simultaneously has seldom been undertaken.Methods: Drawing on primary research consisting of 20 double narrative interviews with young adult offenders on an Intensive Community Order, the paper builds upon the two most prominent social identity models surrounding addictive behaviour, the Social Identity Model of Recovery and the Social Identity Model of Cessation Maintenance in order to develop a social identity model which aids our understanding of desistance and recovery processes.Results: The paper presents a Social Identity Model of Transition (SIMOT), allowing for the synergies between desistance and recovery as processes of transition to come to light.Conclusion: SIMOT allows for an understanding of the role of social identity transformation in the transient nature of desistance and recovery processes. The model allows for an examination of the impact of macro and micro contextual factors on desistance and recovery processes in a way which has seldom been possible with the currently available models.",Article,2018, Addiction Research and Theory,,0,"

Online Social Endorsement and Covid-19 Vaccine Hesitancy in the United Kingdom,"['Andrew Chadwick', 'Johannes Kaiser', 'Cristian Vaccari[...]', 'Li-Yuang Yu']","We explore the implications of online social endorsement for the Covid-19 vaccination program in the United Kingdom. Vaccine hesitancy is a long-standing problem, but it has assumed great urgency due to the pandemic. By early 2021, the United Kingdom had the world’s highest Covid-19 mortality per million of population. Our survey of a nationally representative sample of UK adults ( N = 5,114) measured socio-demographics, social and political attitudes, media diet for getting news about Covid-19, and intention to use social media and personal messaging apps to encourage or discourage vaccination against Covid-19. Cluster analysis identified six distinct media diet groups: news avoiders, mainstream/official news samplers, super seekers, omnivores, the social media dependent, and the TV dependent. We assessed whether these media diets, together with key attitudes, including Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy, conspiracy mentality, and the news-finds-me attitude (meaning giving less priority to active monitoring of news and relying more on one’s online networks of friends for information), predict the intention to encourage or discourage vaccination. Overall, super-seeker and omnivorous media diets are more likely than other media diets to be associated with the online encouragement of vaccination. Combinations of (a) news avoidance and high levels of the news-finds-me attitude and (b) social media dependence and high levels of conspiracy mentality are most likely to be associated with online discouragement of vaccination. In the direct statistical model, a TV-dependent media diet is more likely to be associated with online discouragement of vaccination, but the moderation model shows that a TV-dependent diet most strongly attenuates the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and discouraging vaccination. Our findings support public health communication based on four main methods. First, direct contact, through the post, workplace, or community structures, and through phone counseling via local health services, could reach the news avoiders. Second, TV public information advertisements should point to authoritative information sources, such as National Health Service (NHS) and other public health websites, which should then feature clear and simple ways for people to share material among their online social networks. Third, informative social media campaigns will provide super seekers with good resources to share, while also encouraging the social media dependent to browse away from social media platforms and visit reliable and authoritative online sources. Fourth, social media companies should expand and intensify their removal of vaccine disinformation and anti-vax accounts, and such efforts should be monitored by well-resourced, independent organizations.",Article,2021, Social Media + Society,Jul 15,1,"

From gateways to multilinear connections: A qualitative longitudinal investigation of the relationships between vaping and smoking among adolescent users,"['Jason Hughes', 'Grace Sykes', 'Kahryn Hughes[...]', 'Khalid Karim']","Background: The international growth of e-cigarette use has been accompanied by a corresponding concern that e-cigarettes will act as a 'gateway' to smoking and the use of other drugs. Taking these concerns as our point of departure, we explore the relationships between vaping and smoking among a cohort of young people. Methods: Qualitative longitudinal methods with a diverse sample of 36 14-18-year olds from the UK city of Leicester. A total of 66 depth interviews conducted across two phases separated by 6-12 months. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Findings: We highlight a complex 'tangle' of connections between substances/risk behaviours recounted to us by our adolescent study participants, including multiple and multilinear relationships between vaping and smoking. These findings problematise some of the core axioms of the notion of gateways as an explanatory model of causality and sequential connection between smoking and vaping. They also throw into question gateway logics more fundamentally. While many of our study participants themselves consciously invoked ideas of 'gateway effects', the accounts they produced repeatedly disrupted the logics of connection (between e-cigarettes and smoking; one set of behaviours and another) presupposed in gateway theory and our own early lines of questioning. Accordingly, we explore how cultural understandings of gateway effects are invoked by users in accounting for their vaping and smoking behaviours, noting the potential influence of these ideas upon the very processes they are understood to apprehend.

Mediating Class in a Classless Society? Media and Social Inequalities in Socialist Eastern Europe,['Sabina In Mihelj'],"It is tempting to assume that state socialist media abounded with idealised depictions of working-class citizens. Yet, while workers were indeed glorified in official rhetoric, popular media offered a rather different picture. Drawing on the analysis of television fiction from five state socialist countries, this chapter shows that miners, farmers and factory workers were often overshadowed by engineers, lawyers and public officials whose tastes, habits and aspirations appeared remarkably ‘middle class’. Such patterns of representation were rooted in persistent forms of social inequality that privileged the socialist ‘middle classes’ over citizens in blue-collar occupations.",Chapter,2021,,,0,"

Abstract TP125: Intracranial Stenosis Subtypes in Patients Aged 45 Years or Younger,"['Wei-Hai Xu', 'Yu-Yuan Xu', 'Mingli Li[...]', 'Shan Gao']","Objective: Using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging(HRMRI), we sought to examine the proportions of intracranial stenosis subtypes and their clinical relevance in young patients(≤45 years old). Methods: One hundred and twenty-nine consecutive patients (mean age 36±8 years) with middle cerebral artery stenosis and without Moyamoya disease were evaluated by HRMRI. The stenosis was classified as eccentric stenosis, concentric stenosis, and mixed stenosis if both eccentric and concentric stenosis occurred in one vessel. The clinical data and vessel wall properties were analyzed among the subtypes. Results: Eccentric stenosis was found in 86 (69.4%) patients, while concentric stenosis was found in 26 patients (21.0%) and mixed stenosis in 12(9.7%) patients. The patients with eccentric stenosis were older (p<0.001) and more likely had atherosclerosis risk factors (p=0.024). The patients with concentric stenosis were more likely female, and aged 35 years old or younger. All mixed stenosis were high-grade (>70%) stenotic. All concentric stenosis showed constrictive remodeling, while eccentric and mixed stenosis had heterogeneous remodeling types. In 34 patients with available enhanced images, ring enhancement was revealed in 8/9(88.9%) concentric stenosis and 5/5(100%) mixed stenosis, but only in 3/20(15%) eccentric stenosis (P<0.001). Ten of twelve (83.3%) patients with mixed stenosis were symptomatic, more frequently than the patients with eccentric stenosis (57.0%, p=0.072) and the patients with concentric stenosis (50%, p=0.052). Conclusions: The distinct vessel wall features among intracranial stenosis subtypes suggest heterogeneous pathophysiology. Further studies are required to i

Abstract 2786: Moyamoya Syndrome Associated With Graves' Disease: Report Of 16 Cases,"['Jun NI', 'Li-xin ZHOU', 'Yan-ping WEI[...]', 'Li-ying CUI']","Background and purpose Moyamoya disease is a cerebrovascular disorder characterized by bilateral progressive stenosis and occlusion of terminal portions of internal carotid artery (ICA) accompanying by typical net-like collateral vessels. Patients with both the characteristic moyamoya vasculopathy and the associated conditions are categorized as moyamoya syndrome. These conditions include sickle cell disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, Down’s disease, cranial therapeutic irradiation and other rare diseases. Moyamoya syndrome associated with Graves’ disease has been rarely reported and the underlying coexisting mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study is to identify the clinical and radiological findings of the patients with simultaneous diagnosis of moyamoya syndrome and Graves’ disease. Possible mechanisms predisposing these individuals to ischemic accidents are discussed. Methods We retrospectively identified 12 patients in Peking Union Medical College Hospital and 4 patients in 307 hospital of PLA between May 2000 and December 2010. All patients were female and mean age (range) was 35.13±12.34 years (11-57 years). The patients were diagnosed with Graves’ disease in endocrinology clinic which meet the full diagnostic criteria and no atherosclerotic factor was found in them. Moyamoya vasculopathy was definitely or probably diagnosed by digital subtract angiography or magnetic resonance angiography. The clinical characteristics and prognosis, laboratory data, vascular radiological characteristics were all collected. Results Stenosis or occlusion of bilateral distal ICA and/or proximal anterior /middle cerebral arteries was found in 13 patients. Three patients had unilateral distal ICA

Abstract T MP54: High-resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Intracranial Stenosis in Patients Younger Than 35 Years,"['Weihai Xu', 'Mingli Li', 'Shan Gao[...]', 'Li-Ying Cui']","Background: Using High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging(HRMRI), we aimed to investigate the etiology of intracranial stenosis in patients younger than 35 years. Methods: Fifty-four consecutive patients (mean age,29±6 years) with middle cerebral artery stenosis were evaluated by HRMRI. The morphology of artery lesions and clinical data were analyzed. Probable atherosclerotic plaques were diagnosed by the presence of eccentric wall thickening. Probable non-atherosclerotic lesions were diagnosed by the presence of concentric wall thickening and absence of plaques.On quantitative analysis, when constrictive remodeling can be identified by visual inspection, vessel shrinkage was defined. Results: Plaques were found in 32 (59%) patients, including 13 patients without any atherosclerosis risk factors. The patients with a plaque tended to be older (p=0.061), male (p=0.013), and more likely have atherosclerosis risk factors(59% vs. 23%, p=0.012), expansive artery remodeling (37.5% vs. 0,p<0.001), and infarctions (75% vs. 45%, p=0.044). The non-atherosclerotic lesions more often displayed vessel shrinkage (100% vs. 31%, p<0.001) and concentric wall enhancement (83% vs.13%, p<0.001). Conclusion: In this study, atherosclerosis accounted for a high percentage of intracranial artery stenosis in patients younger than 35 years when HRMRI was introduced into the diagnostic setting. Intracranial non-atherosclerotic stenosis has distinct vascular pathophysiology from atherosclerotic stenosis and is often free from stroke.",Article,2015, Stroke,,0,"

Greatly increased requests for digital (e.g. phones) and third party (e.g. school or mental health records) evidence from victim-survivors after the R Vs Allan case in 2017, had intensified victim-survivor scrutiny and reduced police charging and court summons to their current low. With sexual offences causing immense distress and harm to those victimized, and victim-survivors not having the confidence with the criminal justice system due to aggressive questioning, leaving them feeling as if they are on trial, it is perhaps not so surprising that few victim-survivors report to the police. The criminal justice system is not only failing victim-survivors, it is harming many of them. In previous publications we called for independent legal representation for victim-survivors to reduce the trauma associated with needless scrutiny of victim-survivor’s personal lives. Independent legal representation aims to provide legal support, aid, and advice to complainants in order to prevent aggressive and inappropriate questioning, help victim-survivors with data consent forms and also aims to prevent further damage to victim-survivors’ mental health. Whilst we welcome HM Government’s pledge to consult on and pilot access to legal advice to rape victim-survivors, this delays rolling out this service across England and Wales when there has already been an evaluation of such a service in England, the system is already proposed in Scotland, and Ireland already has independent legal representation, as does much of Europe.",Article,2021,,Jul 1,0,"

"Income, welfare, housing and the transition to higher order births in the UK","['Ann Berrington', 'Juliet Stone']","The UK shows relatively high levels of progression to higher order birth compared to the rest of Europe. It is often assumed that the means-tested benefits system has an indirect pronatalist effect for low-income families, but robust empirical evidence is lacking. We use household panel data from a large nationally representative study to examine the relationship between household income, receipt of welfare benefits, housing, and the probability of experiencing a second, third or fourth birth. Associations with income vary by parity and women’s age. High levels of child tax credit receipt are associated with an increased risk of third birth. Social housing shows a strong, positive association with third and fourth birth. Whilst demographic factors – particularly women’s age – remain the strongest predictor of parity progression, we provide new evidence to suggest that welfare receipt and housing circumstances contribute to explaining social polarisation in family size in the UK.",Article,2017,,Jun 23,1,"

The Low Income Gap: A New Indicator Based on a Minimum Income Standard,"['Donald Hirsch', 'Matt Padley', 'Juliet Stone', 'Laura Valadez-Martinez']","In many high-income countries, governments seek to ensure that households at least have sufficient incomes to afford basic essentials such as food and clothing, but also to help citizens reach socially acceptable living standards allowing full participation in society. Their success in doing so is commonly monitored in terms of how many citizens are below a poverty line set relative to median income, and by how far below it they fall (the ‘poverty gap’). Yet the threshold below which this gap starts to be measured is arbitrary, begging the question of what level of low income needs addressing. A more ambitious measure, presented in this paper, considers the extent to which people fall short of a benchmark representing a socially agreed minimum standard. This ‘low income gap’ can be used to represent the distance a society has to go to eliminate income that is undesirably low. The paper presents the indicator, its meaning and some recent trends in the United Kingdom, where the methodology behind the indicator has been pioneered. The results demonstrate that this empirically derived benchmark has the potential to be of value in other countries, in assessing whether they are making progress in reducing low income.",Article,2020, Social Indicators Research,,1,"

Understanding third and fourth births in Britain: What role do increased immigration and multiple partnerships play?,"['Ann Berrington', 'Juliet Stone']","The proportion of UK families with three or more children is high in European perspective. Commentators often assume that high rates of progression to third, fourth and higher order births result from the higher fertility of women who migrated to the UK from regions of the world where large families are common. Less attention has focused on the role of serial partnering where repartnered couples cement their commitment with a ‘shared child’. This paper provides new empirical evidence as to the relative importance of increased international migration and increased experience of multiple partnerships in fostering higher order births among British women now aged 45+ who were born 1940-1969. We conclude that migration from high fertility regions, and the experience of multiple partnerships are both associated with progression to third and fourth birth. However, the likelihood of going on to have a third or fourth birth has remained similar across these birth cohorts for women who were born in the UK (to UK-born parents), and those who have only been married once, suggesting that additional factors encourage large families in the UK.",Article,2017,,,0,"

Short-term ethnography and women’s voices: insights from fieldwork with Roma communities,"['Cristian Tileaga', 'Ana S. Popoviciu', 'Jo Aldridge']","In this paper, we explore the potential of short-term ethnography in a collaborative and participatory research project on experiences with and perceptions of migration from fieldwork with Roma groups in north-western Transylvania. We discuss particularly the challenges we encountered in engaging Roma women in terms of existing cultural and gender norms evident in some Roma communities. We argue that, in the context of working with women in patriarchal communities, short-term ethnography offers researchers a unique opportunity to (a) find and take advantage of safe spaces in which to talk to women and (b) manage sensitively access and rapport. In this study, ethnography gave insights into alternative ways of engagement in the research process based on categorisations that emphasise alternative aspects of social identity (Roma ‘mothers’ vs. Roma ‘women’) as an effective means of breaking down some of the barriers to participation. Finally, we argue that short-term ethnography can be used successfully in collaborative and participatory research projects alongside traditional ethnographic work to explore the perspectives of mobile and vulnerable or marginalised groups including, but not limited to, patriarchal group contexts.",Article,2021, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,Jun 21,0,"

The end of ‘Welcome Culture’? How the Cologne assaults reframed Germany’s immigration discourse,"['Iris Wigger', 'Alexander Yendell', 'David Herbert']","Controversy over immigration and integration intensified in German news media following Chancellor Merkel’s response to the refugee crisis of 2015. Using multidimensional scaling of word associations in reporting across four national news publications in conjunction with key event, moral panic and framing theories, we argue that reporting of events at Cologne station on New Year’s Eve 2015–2016 reframed debate away from terror-related concerns and towards anxieties about the sexual predation of dark-skinned males, thus racializing immigration coverage and resonating with a long history of Orientalist stereotyping. We further identify an increased clustering of ‘race’, gender, religion, crowd-threat and national belonging terms in reporting on sexual harassment incidents following Cologne, suggesting an increased criminalization of immigration discourse. The article provides new empirically based insights into the dynamics of news media reporting on migrants in Germany and contributes to scholarly debates on media framing of migrants, sexuality and crime.",Article,2021, European Journal of Communication,Jun 18,1,"

PHGDH Is Upregulated at Translational Level and Implicated in Platin-Resistant in Ovarian Cancer Cells,"['Fangfang Bi', 'Yuanyuan An', 'Tianshui Sun[...]', 'Qing Yang']","Background Platinum-based chemotherapy is the first line option for ovarian cancer. The development of resistance to such chemotherapy results in treatment failure, while the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.Methods Clinical samples were collected from Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University. MTT assay was used to see the proliferation and chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells. Transwell migration and Matrigel invasion assays was used to see the invasion ability of ovarian cancer cells. In addition, polysome profiling and tissue microarray and immunohistochemical staining were also used. The statistical significance of the difference was analyzed by ANOVA and post hoc Dunnett’s test.ResultsPHGDH is the first enzyme responsible for serine biosynthesis pathway. The current study demonstrated that PHGDH is upregulated in platin-resistant ovarian cancer cells and tissues at the protein level. Importantly, knockdown of PHGDH suppressed, while overexpression of PHGDH increased the survival upon cisplatin exposure, invasiveness and spheroid formation of ovarian cancer cells. The current study demonstrated that PHGDH translation was upregulated in platin-resistant ovarian cancer. In addition, our study provided evidence that LncRNA RMRP (RNA Component of Mitochondrial RNA Processing Endoribonuclease) was upregulated in platin-resistant ovarian cancer, which promoted enrichment of RNA binding protein DDX3X (DEAD-Box Helicase 3 X-Linked) on the PHGDH mRNA to promote its translation.Conclusion Collectively, the current study described that PHGDH was upregulated and conferred resistance of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin, suggesting that cisplatin resistance could be overcome

Using evidence from detailed ethnographic fieldwork, with musicians, festival organisers, tour operators, business owners and civil servants, this paper examines how issues such as geographical and social distance, internet connectivity, and cultural tourism are understood in relation to the musical life of Argyll and Bute. We advocate for greater ethnographic engagement with local communities in order to provide a more sophisticated, real-world understanding of rural cultural policy and the impact of current policies on local musicians. The paper therefore foregrounds ethnography as an important method in local, rural contexts such as Argyll and Bute, where typically, much of the creative economy is embedded in statistically invisible economic and cultural activity and portfolio employment.",Article,2021, Creative Industries Journal,Jun 4,1,"

Reduced burnout and higher mindfulness in medical students after a self-care program during the COVID-19 pandemic,"['Denisse Zúñiga', 'Manuel Torres-Sahli', 'Pía Nitsche[...]', 'Marcela Bitran']","Background: Medical students experience high levels of psychological stress during clinical training. However, most medical curricula do not teach self-care skills. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted medical education causing increased distress among students. Aim: To report the implementation and impact of an eight-week multifaceted mindfulness-based self-care program on medical students’ distress and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Methods: One hundred twenty-three fourth-year medical students attended the program as part of a mandatory course from April to May 2020, during the rising phase of COVID-19 in Chile. They were evaluated using validated tests before and immediately after the program. The measures included burnout, dispositional mindfulness, perceived stress, traumatic stress reactions, general well-being, resilience, and stress coping strategies. Results: Burnout prevalence decreased from 48% to 24%, whereas students with high dispositional mindfulness increased from 25% to 44%. Burnout reduction was mostly due to decreased emotional exhaustion. Additionally, students reported lower levels of stress, self-blaming, and traumatic stress reactions alongside an increased use of active coping strategies and resilience levels after the program. Conclusions: A formal educational intervention, teaching self-awareness and self-regulation skills can help reduce medical students’ distress and promote their well-being even amidst a pandemic.",Article,2021, Revista medica de Chile,Jun 1,1,"

Probation and Privatisation,['Philip Bean'],"Privatisation was introduced into the probation service on the 1st June 2014 whereby work with medium and low risk offenders went to a number of private and voluntary bodies, work with high risk offenders remained with the State. The National Probation Service (NPS) covered State work whilst the 35 existing Probation Trusts were replaced by 21 Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs). Staff were allocated to either side of the divide but all remained as probation officers. The effect was that the existing probation service lost control of all but 30,000 of the most high risk cases, with the other 220,000 low to medium risk offenders being farmed out to private firms. Privatisation was justified as the only available way of achieving important policy objectives of extending post release supervision to offenders on short sentences, a group who are the most prolific offenders with high reconviction rates yet who receive no statutory support. This book describes the process by which the probation service became privatised, assessing its impact on the probation service itself, and on the criminal justice system generally. It considers both the justifications for privatisation, as well as the criticisms of it, and asks to what extent the probation service can survive such changes, and what future it has as a service dedicated to the welfare of offenders. It demonstrates how the privatisation of probation can be seen as a trend away from traditional public service in criminal justice towards an emphasis on efficiency and cost effectiveness. This book is essential reading for criminology students engaged with criminal justice, social policy, probation, punishment and working with offenders.

"Audience Engagement with COVID-19 News: The Impact of Lockdown and Live Coverage, and the Role of Polarization","['Sabina In Mihelj', 'Katherine Kondor', 'Václav Štětka']","Existing research on media and the COVID-19 pandemic is largely based on quantitative data, focused on digital media, limited to single-country studies, and often West-centred. As such, it has limited capacity to provide a holistic account of the causes and consequences of audience engagement with COVID-19 news, or to consider the impact of systemic political and media factors. To compensate for that, we examine a large set of qualitative interviews and media diaries collected in four eastern European countries during the first wave of the pandemic. We show that changes in news consumption—including the resurgence of television and decline of print consumption—were not driven solely by audience demand for up-to-date information, but also by practical constrains of home-bound life in lockdown, and the introduction of live briefings. Our findings underscore disruption and uncertainty as key elements of audience experiences and highlight the markedly privatized and depoliticized nature of public debate in the early phase of the pandemic. We argue that the pandemic was an unpredictable, open-ended, and exhausting media event with high potential for divisiveness and polarization, especially in contexts marked by low levels of media freedom, declining democratic standards, and elite-led politicization of the crisis.",Article,2021, Journalism Studies,May 28,0,"

Rhetorical uses of precise numbers and semi-magical round numbers in political discourse about COVID-19: Examples from the government of the United Kingdom,['Michael Billig'],"This paper examines how the British government has used statistics about COVID-19 for political ends. A distinction is made between precise and round numbers. Historically, using round numbers to estimate the spread of disease gave way in the 19th century to the sort precise, but not necessarily accurate, statistics that are now being used to record COVID-19. However, round numbers have continued to exert rhetorical, ‘semi-magical’ power by simultaneously conveying both quantity and quality. This is demonstrated in examples from the British government’s claims about COVID-19. The paper illustrates how senior members of the UK government use ‘good’ round numbers to frame their COVID-19 goals and to announce apparent achievements. These round numbers can provide political incentives to manipulate the production of precise number; again examples from the UK government are given.",Article,2021, Discourse and Society,May 17,0,"

Navigating High-choice European Political Information Environments: A Comparative Analysis of News User Profiles and Political Knowledge,"['Laia Castro', 'Jesper Strömbäck', 'Frank Esser[...]', 'Yannis Theocharis']","The transition from low- to high-choice media environments has had far-reaching implications for citizens’ media use and its relationship with political knowledge. However, there is still a lack of comparative research on how citizens combine the usage of different media and how that is related to political knowledge. To fill this void, we use a unique cross-national survey about the online and offline media use habits of more than 28,000 individuals in 17 European countries. Our aim is to (i) profile different types of news consumers and (ii) understand how each user profile is linked to political knowledge acquisition. Our results show that five user profiles – news minimalists, social media news users, traditionalists, online news seekers, and hyper news consumers – can be identified, although the prevalence of these profiles varies across countries. Findings further show that both traditional and online-based news diets are correlated with higher political knowledge. However, online-based news use is more widespread in Southern Europe, where it is associated with lower levels of political knowledge than in Northern Europe. By focusing on news audiences, this study provides a comprehensive and fine-grained analysis of how contemporary European political information environments perform and contribute to an informed citizenry.",Article,2021, The International Journal of Press/Politics,May 14,1,"

Media diversity and the analysis of qualitative variation,"['David Deacon', 'James Stanyer']","Diversity is recognised as a significant criterion for appraising the democratic performance of media systems. This article begins by considering key conceptual debates that help differentiate types and levels of diversity. It then addresses a core methodological challenge in measuring diversity: how do we model statistical variation and difference when many measures of source and content diversity only attain the nominal level of measurement? We identify a range of obscure statistical indices developed in other fields that measure the strength of ‘qualitative variation’. Using original data, we compare the performance of five diversity indices and, on this basis, propose the creation of a more effective diversity average measure. The article concludes by outlining innovative strategies for drawing statistical inferences from these measures, using bootstrapping and permutation testing resampling.

Tolerance through Indifference: Autoreactive B Cells to the Nuclear Antigen La Show No Evidence of Tolerance in a Transgenic Model,"['Brett D Aplin', 'Catherine L Keech', 'Andrea L de Kauwe[...]', 'James McCluskey']","Systemic autoimmune diseases are characterized by the production of high titer autoantibodies specific for ubiquitous nuclear self-Ags such as DNA, Sm, and La (SS-B), so the normal mechanisms of B cell tolerance to disease-associated nuclear Ags have been of great interest. Mechanisms of B cell tolerance include deletion, anergy, developmental arrest, receptor editing, and B cell differentiation to the B-1 subtype. However, recent studies in our laboratory have suggested that B cell tolerance to the nuclear autoantigen La is limited in normal mice, and tolerance may reside primarily in the T cell compartment. To test this hypothesis, we created Ig transgenic mice expressing the IgM H chain from an mAb specific for a xenogeneic epitope within human La (hLa). These mice were bred with hLa-transgenic mice that constitutively express hLa in a manner comparable to endogenous mouse La. Between 5-15% of transgenic B cells developing in the absence of hLa were specific for hLa, and these cells were neither depleted nor developmentally arrested in the presence of endogenous hLa expression. Instead, these autoreactive B cells matured normally and differentiated into Ab-forming cells, capable of secreting high titer autoantibody. Additionally, the life span of autoreactive hLa-specific B cells was not reduced, and they were phenotypically and functionally indistinguishable from naive nonautoreactive hLa-specific B cells developing in the absence of hLa. Together these data suggest a lack of intrinsic B cell tolerance involving any known mechanisms indicating that these autoreactive B cells are indifferent to their autoantigen.",Article,2004, The Journal of Immunology,May 11,1,"

Methods Nine manufacturers of EIA kits to detect antibodies of defined specificities participated in a study in which they received coded sera from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These coded sera contained different dilutions of antibody of one specificity mixed with sera containing antibodies of other specificities. The manufacturers were asked to use their standard technology to determine antibody content and send the data to a committee of the International Union of Immunological Societies for analysis. The data were analyzed for sensitivity and specificity in the detection of anti–double‐stranded DNA (anti‐dsDNA), anti–single‐stranded DNA, antihistone, anti‐Sm, anti–U1 RNP, anti‐SSA/Ro, anti‐SSB/La, anti–Scl‐70 (DNA topoisomerase I), anticentromere, and anti–Jo‐1 antibodies. In addition, replicate samples were included in the coded sera to evaluate the precision of each EIA method. Results Lack of sensitivity and specificity was most evident in the anti‐dsDNA and anti‐Sm kits, although 2 kits for anti‐dsDNA achieved acceptable sensitivity and specificity. Generally, anti‐SSA/Ro, anti‐SSB/La, anti–Scl‐70, anticentromere, and anti–Jo‐1 kits performed well. Many false‐positive results were obtained with a multiple myeloma serum containing cryoprecipitates, but multiple myeloma sera without cryoprecipitates presented no problem in the EIA system.

A critical evaluation of enzyme immunoassay kits for detection of antinuclear autoantibodies of defined specificities. II. Potential for quantitation of antibody content,"['Eng M Tan', 'Josef S Smolen', 'J Steven McDougal[...]', 'James A Koziol']","To analyze the performance of different commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits for measuring antibody levels of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) specific for double stranded (ds) DNA, SSB/La, Sm, and Scl-70. Twenty companies that were known major purveyors of EIA kits for detection of ANA were approached to determine their interest and willingness to participate in this study. The manufacturers were advised that they would be sent coded sera containing mixtures of the Arthritis Foundation/Centers for Disease Control reference reagents, and that they were to use their own test kits to analyze the antibody specificities of these sera and to report the data, in optical density (OD) units, or their equivalent. The analysts were blinded to the concentration of the antibodies and the specificities. Initially, 11 manufacturers out of 20 agreed to participate, but 2 subsequently withdrew. The commercial EIA kits have the potential of being able to quantitate specific autoantibody content to ds-DNA, SSB/La, Sm, and Scl-70. However, certain deficiencies in these kits were also detected, the most obvious being lack of uniformly good performance, with kits of certain manufacturers showing exceptional accuracy in 3 out of 4 of their antibody-specific kits and poor accuracy for a 4th kit. It is important for clinicians to appreciate that there is marked inter-manufacturer variation in the performance of EIA kits used as an aid in the diagnosis of systemic rheumatic diseases. Manufacturers need to exercise constant surveillance of kit performance and to provide assurance that such is being done. Improved EIA kits would lend themselves to reliable quantitation of antibody levels in human sera and help to determine whether serial measurement of antibody levels might b

Range of antinuclear antibodies in “healthy” individuals,"['Eng M Tan', 'T. E. W. Feltkamp', 'J S Smolen[...]', 'JA Koziol']","To determine the range of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in ""healthy"" individuals compared with that in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma), Sjögren's syndrome (SS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or soft tissue rheumatism (STR). Fifteen international laboratories experienced in performing tests for ANA by indirect immunofluorescence participated in analyzing coded sera from healthy individuals and from patients in the 5 different disease groups described above. Except for the stipulation that HEp-2 cells should be used as substrate, each laboratory used its own in-house methodology so that the data might be expected to reflect the output of a cross-section of worldwide ANA reference laboratories. The sera were analyzed at 4 dilutions: 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, and 1:320. In healthy individuals, the frequency of ANA did not differ significantly across the 4 age subgroups spanning 20-60 years of age. This putatively normal population was ANA positive in 31.7% of individuals at 1:40 serum dilution, 13.3% at 1:80, 5.0% at 1:160, and 3.3% at 1:320. In comparison with the findings among the disease groups, a low cutoff point at 1:40 serum dilution (high sensitivity, low specificity) could have diagnostic value, since it would classify virtually all patients with SLE, SSc, or SS as ANA positive. Conversely, a high positive cutoff at 1:160 serum dilution (high specificity, low sensitivity) would be useful to confirm the presence of disease in only a portion of cases, but would be likely to exclude 95% of normal individuals. It is recommended that laboratories performing immunofluorescent ANA tests should report results at both the 1:40 and 1:160 dilutions, and should supply information on the percen

“It is their job to make sure that the long-term vision for the show … stays intact”: Using insights from the television format industry to rethink the concept of media events,['Michael Skey'],"The concept of media events continues to generate widespread debate among scholars around the globe. Studies that have challenged the concept’s functionalist foundations have undoubtedly sharpened our thinking. Conversely, approaches that have sought to expand the concept tend to confuse rather than clarify. In this paper, we argue that events that are planned, anticipated, and involve external organizations in their design demand a specific set of analytical tools. Furthermore, we draw a further distinction between one-off events and those that are cyclical in nature, with the latter being theorized using insights from studies of the television format industry. This approach not only focuses much needed attention on the production side of media events but also on the struggles between different interest groups (rights-holders, event hosts, media producers). We illustrate our arguments by drawing upon ethnographic material from the 2014 Eurovision Song Contest.",Article,2020, Communications,,0,"

Inequities in Children's Reading Skills: The Role of Home Reading and Preschool Attendance,"['Sharon Goldfeld', 'Margarita Moreno-Betancur', 'Shuaijun Guo[...]', ""Meredith O'Connor""]","Objective : Children from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds have poorer learning outcomes. These inequities are a significant public health issue, tracking forward to adverse health outcomes in adulthood. We examined the potential to reduce socioeconomic gaps in children's reading skills through increasing home reading and preschool attendance amongst disadvantaged children. Methods : We drew on data from the nationally representative birth cohort of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (N=5107) to examine the impact of socioeconomic disadvantage (0-1 year) on children's reading skills (8-9 years). An interventional effects approach was applied to estimate the extent to which improving the levels of home reading (2-5 years) and preschool attendance (4-5 years) of socioeconomically disadvantaged children to be commensurate with their advantaged peers, could potentially reduce socioeconomic gaps in children's reading skills. Results : Socioeconomically disadvantaged children had a higher risk of poor reading outcomes compared to more advantaged peers: absolute risk difference=20% (95% CI: 16.0% to 24.2%). Results suggest that improving disadvantaged children's home reading and preschool attendance to the level of their advantaged peers could eliminate 6.5% and 2.1% of socioeconomic gaps in reading skills, respectively. However, large socioeconomic gaps would remain, with disadvantaged children maintaining an 18.3% (95% CI: 14.0% to 22.7%) higher risk of poor reading outcomes in absolute terms. Conclusions : There are clear socioeconomic disparities in children's reading skills by late childhood. Findings suggest that interventions that improve home reading and preschool atte

Perpetuating ableist constructions of the “real world” through complaints about new communication technologies,"['Elizabeth S. Parks', 'Jessica Sarah Robles']","Complaints about the use of new communication technologies are frequent in public discourse and work within a broader assemblage of discourses that promote selective ideologies. What is it that people are doing when they produce these complaints, and how might acts of complaining promote equity in our daily lives? We analyse complaints taken from 16 hours of video recorded dialogues and argue that the complaint discourse about the relationship of new communication technologies to people’s expected embodied functioning and idealized social participation reconstitutes and perpetuates broader ableist discourses about preferred engagement in the “real world.” By identifying intertextuality between two different topical discourses, we expand understanding about the reification of cross-cutting ableist discourses and promote more inclusive language use.",Article,2021, Language and Dialogue,Apr 17,0,"

‘Malaysia belongs to the Malays’ ( Malaysia ni Melayu Punya! ): Categorising ‘us’ and ‘them’ in Malaysia’s mainstream Malay-language newspapers,['Siti Nurnadilla Mohamad Jamil'],"Malaysia’s 13th general election (henceforth, GE13) in 2013 was the final election where the longest-serving elected government in the world, Barisan Nasional (BN), regained power, before it was ousted after over six decades of authoritarian rule in 2018. In a country that practises parliamentary democracy but simultaneously observed close cooperation between the then ruling coalition and the mainstream press, this paper shows the micro-politics of the driving force of the coalition, United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) – specifically, how anxiety regarding the maintenance of their privileged and empowered Malay position dominated the national narrative during the GE13 campaign. Focusing on editorial journalistic genres in four paid-for Malay-language newspapers, I illustrate the typical politics of fear that characterises much of Malaysian right-wing rhetoric – the ways in which racial and religion issues are provoked. The in-depth representational analysis, via the Discourse-historical Approach’s (DHA) nomination and predication strategies, also suggests the normalisation of nationalistic and racist rhetoric, which primarily works with ‘fear’: fear of change, of loss of privilege, of the future, of other races; in principle, almost anything can be constructed as a threat to ‘Us’, an imagined homogenous people inside a well-protected territory through the discursive construction of such in-groups and out-groups.",Article,2020, Critical Discourse Studies,Apr 17,0,"

"The space of media usage in Finland, 2007 and 2018: The impact of online activities on its structure and its association with sociopolitical divisions","['Semi Purhonen', 'Adrián Leguina', 'Riie Heikkilä']","In Nordic countries and beyond, there exists a lack of longitudinal, population-level research focused on sociopolitical polarisation and the proliferation of new online activities in the context of changing media usage. In this article, we examine media usage in Finland in 2007 and 2018. We use two nationally representative surveys (N = 1,388 in 2007 and N = 1,425 in 2018) to make comparisons over time and include a wide set of media usage indicators. Applying multiple correspondence analysis, we assess the impact of the proliferation of online activities on the structure of the space of media usage and examine whether the association between media usage and sociopolitical divisions has become more sharply pronounced. The results suggest stability of the structure of media use rather than dramatic change. We discuss these results by reflecting on the relatively strong persistence of “traditional” models of stratification in digital cultural consumption and media practices.",Article,2021, Nordicom Review,Apr 16,1,"

Cosmopolitanism in Hard Times,"['Sylvie Mesure', 'Delphine Pagès-El Karoui', 'Camille Schmoll[...]', 'Vincenzo Cicchelli']","This reference book provides the reader with an exhaustive array of epistemological, theoretical, and empirical explorations related to the field of cosmopolitanism studies. It considers the cosmopolitan perspective rather as a relevant approach to the understanding of some major issues related to globalization than as a subfield of global studies. In this unique contribution to conceptualizing, establishing, experiencing, and challenging cosmopolitanism, each chapter seizes the paradoxical dialectic of opening up and closing up, of enlightenment and counter-enlightenment, of hope and despair at work in the global world, while the volume as a whole insists on the moral, intellectual, structural, and historical resources that still make cosmopolitanism a real possibility — and not just wishful thinking — even in these hard times.

"Facilitativeness, Conflict, Demand for Approval, Self-Esteem, and Satisfaction With Romantic Relationships",['Duncan Cramer'],"This study is an examination of the extent to which satisfaction with a main current romantic relationship is associated with negative conflict, demand for approval, self-esteem, and the 3 facilitative conditions of unconditional regard, empathy, and congruence. One or more of these conditions have been proposed as important determinants of relationship satisfaction by various relationship-enhancement approaches such as behavioral marital therapy and cognitive-behavioral marital therapy. College students (86 women and 58 men) completed S. S. Hendrick's (1988) Relationship Satisfaction Scale, a measure of negative conflict formulated by the author, R. G. Jones's (1969) Demand for Approval Scale (modified for a particular relationship), M. Rosenberg's (1965) Self-Esteem Scale, and a shortened modified version of G. T. Barrett-Lennard's (1964) Relationship Inventory. Relationship satisfaction was most strongly related to the level of regard and empathy, which is consistent with approaches to relationships that emphasize empathy training.",Article,2003, The Journal of Psychology Interdisciplinary and Applied,Mar 24,0,"

The Continued Domination of Western Journalists in Global African News Telling: The Imperatives and Implications,['Chikaire Ezeru'],"Who reports Africa in the British press? This longitudinal study is aimed at addressing the issue. It applied content analysis methodology, the use of four British national newspapers and a sample duration that spanned between 1992 and 2017. It uncovered that Western journalists consistently dominated the reportage of Africa without any exception throughout the sample period. Apart from Western journalists, other journalists or sources involved in the media coverage—African local journalists, Afro-Western journalists, joint journalists, and news agencies’ African reports were insignificantly used. Also, this study further revealed that the use of news agencies’ African reports had a continuous decline from 1997 to 2017. Therefore, the domination of the British press coverage of Africa over the years by Western journalists results in the portrayal of Africa from an imbalanced single prism of Westernised perspective, thereby resulting in the poor coverage of Africa and the spread of further ignorance of the continent to the global audience, which hampers both tourism and Western business investments to Africa. This study concludes that who reports Africa in the UK press is embedded in neo-colonialism, white hegemony, and inequality.",Article,2021,,Mar 16,0,"

YOT Talk: Examining the communicative influences on children's engagement with youth justice assessment processes,"['Stephen Case', 'Nuria Lorenzo-Dus', 'Ralph Morton']","This article presents an evidence-based analysis of the communicative influences on children’s engagement in the Youth Justice System of England and Wales. The multidisciplinary criminologist–linguist ‘YOT Talk’ project utilized Svalberg’s (2009) dimensions of engagement (cognitive, affective, social; augmented by behavioural) to explore the enablers of, and barriers to, children’s engagement with youth justice assessment processes. A tripartite mixed methodology of observation of assessment interviews, questionnaires with children in the Youth Justice System and youth justice practitioners, and focus groups with practitioners was implemented across three Youth Offending Teams in England and Wales. Analyses synergized methods from conversation analysis and corpus linguistics. Findings inform recommendations for refocusing youth justice assessment and staff training on facilitating children’s communicative engagement (that is, enhancing enablers and removing/minimizing barriers). These findings and recommendations challenge asymmetrical (adult-centric) power dynamics during assessment interviews and challenge perceptions of children’s communicative deficits as irreconcilable barriers to effective assessment.",Article,2021, European Journal of Criminology,Mar 9,0,"
