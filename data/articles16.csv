The COVID-19 pandemic: the essential role of the voluntary sector in emergency response and resilience planning,"['Claire Bynner', 'Maureen McBride', 'Sarah Weakley']","This research note highlights the need to engage the voluntary sector in strategic emergency response and resilience planning with the local state. It draws on qualitative fieldwork in two Scottish local authorities, which explored service responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in high-poverty neighbourhoods. The data comprised 25 interviews with front-line workers and senior managers in voluntary sector and public sector organisations. Interviews were conducted during the spring 2020 lockdown and subsequent easing of restrictions. The article employs Young’s (2000) models of government to analyse the relationship between voluntary organisations and the state. The findings indicate that this iterative crisis requires the relational skills of the voluntary sector to supplement the local state and provide a sustainable response to the needs of vulnerable populations. There is a need for a new strategic and complementary relationship, one that fully engages locally embedded voluntary organisations at all stages of emergency response and resilience planning.",Article,1 , Voluntary Sector Review,Jul 19,0,"

How unhealthy commodity industries find a global audience in the English Premier League. Three case studies of brand engagement,"['Robin Ireland', 'Christopher Bunn', 'Stephanie Chambers', 'Gerda Reith']","Background: Establishing the English Premier League has resulted in a dramatic rise in commercial activities, raising public health concerns around unhealthy brand marketing. Methods: Three linked case studies analysed the marketing techniques of three of the Premier League’s partners in the 2019/20 season: Coca-Cola, Budweiser, and Cadbury. Data from Twitter were triangulated with promotional materials, product promotions in supermarkets and grey literature. An inductive thematic analysis explored the strategies used to engage fans. Results: The studies show sponsors purchasing access to fans and inserting their brands into the emotional and passionate environment of EPL football. Sponsors evoke cultural traditions to align with and engage fans, to encourage consumption. Consumption is ‘responsibilised’ and positioned as an individual choice. Conclusions: The marketing techniques identified exploit social and cultural dimensions of EPL football to increase consumption of unhealthy brands, with the potential to negatively impact on the health of the EPL’s audience.",Article,1 , Soccer and Society,,0,"

Inhibition of myocardial cathepsin-L release during reperfusion following myocardial infarction improves cardiac function and reduces infarct size,"['Weihong He', 'Charlotte McCarroll', 'Katrin Nather[...]', 'Christopher Michael Loughrey']","Aims Identifying novel mediators of lethal myocardial reperfusion injury that can be targeted during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is key to limiting the progression of patients with ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) to heart failure. Here we show through parallel clinical and integrative preclinical studies the significance of the protease cathepsin-L on cardiac function during reperfusion injury. Methods and Results We found that direct cardiac release of cathepsin-L in STEMI patients (n = 76) immediately post-PPCI leads to elevated serum cathepsin-L levels and that serum levels of cathepsin-L in the first 24 hour post-reperfusion are associated with reduced cardiac contractile function and increased infarct size. Preclinical studies, demonstrate that inhibition of cathepsin-L release following reperfusion injury with CAA0225 reduces infarct size and improves cardiac contractile function by limiting abnormal cardiomyocyte calcium handling and apoptosis. Conclusion Our findings suggest that cathepsin-L is a novel therapeutic target that could be exploited clinically to counteract the deleterious effects of acute reperfusion injury after an acute STEMI. Translational perspective New therapeutic targets are urgently required to limit myocardial damage after reperfusion injury. We identified cardiac release of the protease cathepsin-L among patients following primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). Elevated serum levels of cathepsin-L were associated with reduced contractile function and increased infarct size at 24 hour and 6 months post-PPCI. Work conducted using animal models indicated that cardiac release of cathepsin-L mediated cardiac dysfunction following reperfusion injury. Specific inhibit

"Lights, camera, provocation? Exploring experiences of surveillance in the policing of Scottish football","['Niall Hamilton-Smith', 'Maureen McBride', 'Colin Atkinson']","Based primarily on research into the policing of football fans in Scotland following the implementation of the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications Act (Scotland) Act 2012 this paper examines the interplay of police techniques and surveillance technologies in the policing of Scottish football. There has been relatively little academic attention directed towards the Act, so the question of why and how this flagship legislation generated such intense opposition that it was repealed within six years of its introduction demands investigation. This paper explores the implementation of the Act from the perspectives of football fans, criminal justice agencies, and representatives of football clubs, with a specific focus on the impact of police surveillance practices. The research uncovered strong perceptions that such practices were considered intimidatory, which may have weakened the perceived legitimacy of the Act. This paper poses a challenge to simple readings of evidence in terms of the claimed benefits of particular forms of surveillance, arguing that the use of technologies such as powerful hand-held cameras and body worn video (BWV) has had a detrimental impact on police-fan relationships, interactions and dialogue.",Article,1 , Policing and Society,Mar 21,0,"

The impact of the initial Covid-19 lockdown upon regular sports bettors in Britain: Findings from a cross-sectional online study,"['Heather Wardle', 'Craig Donnachie', 'Nathan Hunt[...]', 'Kate Hunt']","Background In Britain, unprecedented restrictions on daily life associated with the Covid-19 pandemic included the suspension of professional sports events during the initial ‘lockdown’. This provides opportunities to observe changes in sports bettors’ behaviour when their primary form of activity is removed and assess the impact of Covid-19 related circumstances upon gambling. Methods In July 2020, we conducted an online cross-sectional survey of people who bet regularly (at least monthly) on sports before Covid-19 (n=3866). Bi-variate analyses compared changes in gambling behaviours before and during the initial lockdown. Multi-variate logistic regression models explored associations between problem gambling (men) and moderate risk or problem gambling (MRPG) (women) with changes in Covid-19 related circumstances and changing gambling behaviours during Britain’s initial ‘lockdown’ (March-June 2020). Results 29.8% of male sports bettors and 33.4% of female sports bettors stopped gambling altogether during the initial Covid-19 lockdown, though 17.3% of men and 16.5% of women started a new form of gambling during lockdown. Among men, adjusted odds ratios of problem gambling were higher among those starting a new gambling activity during lockdown (OR=2.50 [95% CI 1.38-4.53]). Among women, adjusted odds ratios of MRPG were higher among those whose frequency of gambling on any activity increased during lockdown (OR=4.21 [1.99-8.92] and among those shielding for health reasons. Poorer wellbeing was associated with problem gambling for men and MRPH for women. Conclusions Those changing gambling behaviours during the initial Covid-19 lockdown (e.g. increasing gambling frequency

Regulatory Resistance? Narratives and Uses of Evidence around “Black Market” Provision of Gambling during the British Gambling Act Review,"['Heather Wardle', 'Gerda Reith', 'Fiona Dobbie[...]', 'Jeremy Shiffman']","Commercial gambling is increasingly viewed as being part of the unhealthy commodities industries, in which products contribute to preventable ill-health globally. Britain has one of the world’s most liberal gambling markets, meaning that the regulatory changes there have implications for developments elsewhere. A review of the British Gambling Act 2005 is underway. This has generated a range of actions by the industry, including mobilising arguments around the threat of the “black market”. We critically explore industry’s framing of these issues as part of their strategy to resist regulatory change during the Gambling Act review. We used a predefined review protocol to explore industry narratives about the “black market” in media reports published between 8 December 2020 and 26 May 2021. Fifty-five articles were identified and reviewed, and themes were narratively synthesised to examine industry framing of the “black market”. The black market was framed in terms of economic threat and loss, and a direct connection was made between its growth and increased regulation. The articles mainly presented gambling industry perspectives uncritically, citing industry-generated evidence (n = 40). Industry narratives around the “black market” speak to economically and emotionally salient concerns: fear, safety, consumer freedom and economic growth. This dominant framing in political, mainstream and industry media may influence political and public opinion to support the current status quo: “protecting” the existing regulated market rather than “protecting” people. Debates should be reframed to consider all policy options, especially those designed to protect public health.",Literature Review,1 , International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,Nov 6,1,"

Post-stenting fractional flow reserve vs coronary angiography for optimisation of percutaneous coronary intervention: TARGET-FFR trial,"['Damien Collison', 'Matthaios Didagelos', 'Muhammad Aetesam-ur-Rahman[...]', 'Keith G Oldroyd']","Aims : A fractional flow reserve (FFR) value ≥0.90 after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with a reduced risk of adverse cardiovascular events. TARGET-FFR is an investigator-initiated, single-centre, randomized controlled trial to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a post-PCI FFR-guided optimization strategy vs. standard coronary angiography in achieving final post-PCI FFR values ≥0.90. Methods and results : After angiographically guided PCI, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive a physiology-guided incremental optimization strategy (PIOS) or a blinded coronary physiology assessment (control group). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a final post-PCI FFR ≥0.90. Final FFR ≤0.80 was a prioritized secondary outcome. A total of 260 patients were randomized (131 to PIOS, 129 to control) and 68.1% of patients had an initial post-PCI FFR <0.90. In the PIOS group, 30.5% underwent further intervention (stent post-dilation and/or additional stenting). There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of the proportion of patients with final post-PCI FFR ≥0.90 between groups (PIOS minus control 10%, 95% confidence interval -1.84 to 21.91, P = 0.099). The proportion of patients with a final FFR ≤0.80 was significantly reduced when compared with the angiography-guided control group (-11.2%, 95% confidence interval -21.87 to -0.35], P = 0.045). Conclusion : Over two-thirds of patients had a physiologically suboptimal result after angiography-guided PCI. An FFR-guided optimization strategy did not significantly increase the proportion of patients with a final FFR ≥0.90, but did reduce the proportion of patients with a final FFR ≤0.80.",Article,1 , European Heart Journal,Jul 22,1,"

Abstract P1-10-29: Radiomics improved pre-therapeutic prediction of breast cancers insensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy,"['Xuezhi Zhou', 'Zhenyu Liu', 'Yang Du[...]', 'Jie Tian']","Background: Approximately 10–35% of breast cancers were found to be insensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), and approximately 5% of patients had larger tumors after NAC; in these patients, NAC failed to exhibit a therapeutic effect and instead delayed surgical treatment. Thus, it is critical to identify predictive biomarkers to enhance patient selection for NAC. Here we report a radiomic model for pre-therapeutic prediction of breast cancers insensitive to NAC. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 125 breast cancer patients (63 in the primary cohort and 62 in the validation cohort) who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (imaging sequence: diffusion-weighted, T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted) before receiving NAC. All patients received surgical resection, and Miller-Payne grading system were applied to assess the response to NAC. Grade 1-2 cases were classified as insensitive to NAC. We extracted 1941 radiomic features in the primary cohort. After feature selection, the optimal feature set was used to construct a radiomic signature using machine learning. We built a combined prediction model incorporating the radiomic signature and independent clinical risk factors using multivariable logistic regression. The performance of the combined model was assessed in the validation cohort. Results: The radiomic signature consisting 4 features showed good performance for identifying Grade 1-2 group, yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 (95% confidence interval: 0.647–1) in the validation cohort. A clinical model based on human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) status and Ki67 index yielded an AUC of 0.792 (95% confidence interval: 0.668–0.916) in the validation co

Radiomics of multi-parametric MRI for pretreatment prediction of pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer: a multicenter study,"['Zhenyu Liu', 'Zhuolin Li', 'Jinrong Qu[...]', 'Jie Tian']","Purpose: We evaluated the performance of the newly proposed radiomics of multiparametric MRI (RMM), developed and validated based on a multicenter dataset adopting a radiomic strategy, for pretreatment prediction of pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. Experimental design: A total of 586 potentially eligible patients were retrospectively enrolled from four hospitals (primary cohort and external validation cohort 1-3). Quantitative imaging features were extracted from T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging before NAC for each patient. With features selected using a coarse to fine feature selection strategy, four radiomic signatures were constructed based on each of the three MRI sequences and their combination. RMM was developed based on the best radiomic signature incorporating with independent clinicopathologic risk factors. The performance of RMM was assessed with respect to its discrimination and clinical usefulness, and compared with that of clinical information-based prediction model. Results: Radiomic signature combining multiparametric MRI achieved an AUC of 0.79 (the highest among the four radiomic signatures). The signature further achieved good performances in hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative group and triple-negative group. RMM yielded an AUC of 0.86, which was significantly higher than that of clinical model in two of the three external validation cohorts. Conclusions: The study suggested a possibility that RMM provided a potential tool to develop a model for predicting pCR to NAC in breast cancer.",Article,9 , Clinical Cancer Research,,0,"

(Not) a good place to stay! – East European migrants’ experiences of settlement in disadvantaged neighbourhoods in Scotland,"['Rebecca Kay', 'Paulina Trevena']","In this article, we ask how migrants establish social relationships, attachments and feelings of belonging within and to disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Drawing on extensive qualitative research with East European migrants in Scotland, we explore empirically the material, relational and temporal aspects of experiences of settlement at the neighbourhood level. We consider the ways in which migrants encounter and assess the material and institutional realities of their neighbourhoods. We examine the social relationships which develop in place, paying attention to social and cultural distancing and mutual ‘othering’, which may run counter to the development of place-based bonds. We discuss the role of time and the processual and ambiguous nature of settlement. Importantly, in our analysis, we consider the possibility that theoretical frameworks developed specifically for understanding migrant experiences might overemphasise their uniqueness and risk overlooking similarities grounded in multi-scalar hierarchies of power, which cut across lines of ethnic or cultural difference. We draw on wider theories and studies of place-attachment, as well as migration studies theories of embedding and emplacement, to explore the ways in which our participants’ experiences may be understood as both similar to and different from more widely shared realities of life in deprived areas.",Article,1 , Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,Feb 20,0,"
